0,"I have been using Halo for a couple of months now and there is so much to like but it feels a bit rough around the edges when compared to other more refined products from Fitbit or Samsung. I have had a number of smart watches and fitness bands over the years. I have been using a high end smart watch for the last year. The problem with that is that I cannot wear my good analog watches without looking like an idiot. Even the Fitbit fitness bands have a large digital display which looks somewhat stupid when you have a big dive watch on the other wrist. So, I wanted something small and really understated. Amazon had invited me to try Halo (paid for it but at a discount) and it looked like it might fit the bill. For the most part it does. Here are the highlights:-Hardware: Not having a screen is strange at first but I have learned to really like it. With all of our devices, it is one less thing to distract me. The device itself is lightweight aluminum that fits the wrist nicely. It has one button for resetting the device if ever needed. A double tap will resync the app and the band if you have had both connected for a bit without using. There are the typical sensors on the bottom to measure your heart rate. I got one with the silver mesh strap. I really like it but opted to buy a silicone strap as the Halo is waterproof and I like to shower without removing it. The mesh strap stayed wet too long for my liking. Amazon has some work to do on the silicone strap designs. They are all pretty ugly but they work. All and all this is a very comfortable device that you won't mind wearing all day everyday.-Software: As one would expect from a company like Amazon, the software experience is where things shine for me. It is still incomplete in some ways but you can see where they are heading and the future is bright. As it sits, it is still pretty great. There are four tabs at the bottom of the app; Data, Lab, Live, and Settings. Data is where your various stats are displayed. Those include Activity, Sleep, Tone, and Body. Let's dig into these.-Activity: Amazon is taking a total activity approach to healthy living. Less about steps though they are there if you want to see them. The idea is that your activity levels throughout the day accumulate for points. For instance, I got 50 points for a 50 minute elliptical session this morning. It automatically picks up your activities but doesn't necessarily always know what you are doing. After my workouts I just go back in and edit them if they are not properly identified. The Halo starts you out at 150 points a week as a target and moves you up as you achieve your target points.  All and all it works great and keeps me motivated.-Sleep tracking: The sleep tracking is thorough and robust. Though if you are like me and sometimes fall asleep on the sofa for an hour and then go to bed, the Halo band will almost always fail to register the first hour. Seems like a simple update at some point. I like the point system Amazon employs here. It drives me to go to bed earlier and leave my TV off.-Tone: This one is a weird one. Basically, the Halo band listens to you and analyzes your tone of voice to try and measure stress and anxiety. It does actually work but I didn't really get much out of it honestly. Further, it significantly reduces your battery life. Maybe by as much as 60%. For me, I would rather have the battery life but I think this will be a highly individual experience. Some will really appreciate this new approach.-Body: Unless you are in really really good shape, this one will probably haunt you a bit but man is it effective so I really recommend utilizing this feature. Basically you set your phone down a solid ten or so feet away from you at waist height with just your underwear on. The app scans your body, captures the image, and calculates your body fat. It is fairly accurate. Maybe a little heavy handed. I am a fifty year old man that works out regularly. Let's just say, after seeing the image and the body fat percentage, I have a lot of work to do. I am extremely motivated to improve both the fat percentage and the image I am looking at in the app. I think the easiest thing to do in life is lie to yourself about how you look. This feature makes that impossible. It hurts but I really like this feature. I will absolutely get healthier because of it. I would add a word of caution here. If you are someone that has struggled with body issues in the past, you might not be right for this device. It definitely makes you more conscious of your body and appearance.The next tab at the bottom is lab. This is where I think Amazon's future in fitness has the most potential. They have partnered with dozens of companies to provide workouts, stretching, yoga, meditations, diet info, and more. I did an Orangetheory workout this morning. It was brutal. I also have been doing a two week bedtime guided meditation. It has been amazing. This is all built into your monthly subscription ($3.99) after your free trial. It really is great and provides an absolute ton of added content value. The best part is Amazon is just getting started here. With Amazon's market power, I have to imagine that Lab is going to become unbelievably valuable in the coming years. If you have been with Prime for a number of years, I can imagine a growth curve similar to that where Amazon just continues to add more value, more content, and probably more cost. I look forward to seeing this.The next tab is the Live tab. Live is simple but great and it is something I wish my Samsung Active 2 offered. You can hit the tab button and see your heart rate or your tone (mood) in real time. When I get on a treadmill, I fire up my jams, go to the Halo app, and hit the Live tab. It shows me an accurate measurement of my heart rate that updates continuously throughout my run. Its something like having a chest strap monitor on without having it on. It has helped me a great deal.Lastly, you have settings. All the typical things you might want to tweak are in there. Solid.All and all, the software experience here is very good and it is likely to get much better. Amazon gave Halo a big update not long ago, presumably in anticipation of it going on sale to the public. It received a lot of upgrades. If Amazon continues to develop and support Halo band, as I anticipate they will, this will just get better.-Battery Life / Charging: With tone turned off, I get in excess of ten days on a charge. With it on, its closer to five or six. Charging from zero-ish percent takes around two hours via a proprietary charger. It is big and I don't love it but it works. So, A for me on battery life and more like a C- on the charger itself.I will update this review as I go with more information but, for now, call me impressed. It isn't perfect. The device is a little clunky and unrefined. Tone is cool but weird. The body scan might bruise your ego a bit. I would love to see the addition of a calorie counting section on the app and a more robust tracking of actual exercise history. After all of that though, what Amazon is really focused on here are three really important aspects of your life: How active are you, how are you sleeping, and how fat you are. If we all just stayed focused on those things, the world would be a much healthier place. So, I am recommending giving Halo a shot, especially if you are sick of the connectivity a smart watch gives you. Today, it just works and motivates me. I cannot wait to see what the future holds with the Amazon Halo Band.***Update***One thing I forgot to add but is important relates to why the Amazon approach to activity is important. Most fitness bands / watches track steps. It is a solid metric. What makes Halo better is, while it tracks steps, it does so in conjunction with the effort you are putting in. So let me show you what I mean. Today, I got credit for just over 4,000 steps on my 50 minute elliptical workout. I got 51 points for it. After going about my day, showering, working, getting ready for tomorrow, etc. I have finished my day at just over 15,000 steps. However, I have only earned an additional 20 points to finish at 71 points for the day. The point is, that the Halo Band is able to weigh steps during a workout as being more valuable than steps taken running around the office or my home. You get credit for those steps but the weight is scored heavier when your heart rate is higher. Steps are good but it is the kind of steps you are taking that make the difference to your health and weight. There are other bands that do this kind of thing but I think that Amazon has executed it particularly well here. One other thing I should have added from my first go is that Halo is partnered with Weight Watchers. My wife uses Weight Watchers and she finds Halo to be incredibly valuable to her efforts. It automatically syncs your activities in your WW account so she doesn't need to track that manually any longer. Great addition for all you Weight Watchers fans. It is available through Labs.03/05/21 Update: Amazon recently released a substantial update to the band which does a number of useful things. First and foremost, it now has voice integration with Alexa that is useful. You can just ask for updates like ""Hey Alexa, how many steps do I have today?"" It is a nice integration. It is optional in the app. I will include a picture of the toggle above. Additionally, they have enhanced sleep tracking. It is more robust and allows you to tap your finger on your sleep grid at any point to see the time much like Fitbit does. They have also enhanced 'Discover' which allows you to more easily find new content such as workouts and meditations you might want to try. Lastly, they added a calendar sync for Tone which I do not use due to the afformentioned battery drain. However, this looks pretty neat. So, say you have ""lunch with Mom"" on your calendar. Halo will track your tone during that time and let you know how your tone and mood seemed during the lunch. I won't use it but it seems like a useful enhancement to a feature that is unique to the Halo band. This update is a great example of the potential this band has if Amazon continues to grow it and support it.",4
1,"All-in-all, very satisfied. Most results have been accurate right from the get-go in my case. I didn't have any issues during setup and I haven't had any connection or charging issues later on either. I especially like the non-intrusive nature of the Halo Band. You just wear it around your wrist and there's nothing else you need to think about. Everything is tracked automatically and I can live my life as usual - but still with the reminder of staying healthy and well through simply wearing the band.The killer feature of Halo, from my perspective, is the focus on personalized health and well-being. Every body and mind is unique and therefore - our health tools, tips, and recommendations should be unique too. At a greater scale, this is only doable through the use of machine learning and personalization through the lessons learned from your personal data. Here, I think Amazon has nailed the balance between privacy and personalization. I love that you can keep everything backed up in the cloud, but you can also choose not to. I love that you can export all of your data with the tap of a button. I love that you can erase everything if you want to. I would probably never do that, but having the option makes all the difference. It increases trust in Amazon and the Halo platform.In terms of personalization, I would like to see Halo going a step further in the future. This is probably already on the roadmap, but perhaps an insights tab, with all of your data through time boiled down to some personalized tips and recommendations for you specifically. Right now, they do give you insights on the Home tab when it recognizes a pattern in your recent habits - which is great! However, I'd also love to have graphs of all of my data - and I mean all. If I'm going to use the Halo platform for perhaps the next 10 years (maybe more), then I also want all 10 years' data available in the app, shown on graphs, etc. Also, the export file should include everything - which they also do. So, that's great!Down the line, it would be great to see some sort of integration with Alexa. This could be, having your data and insights show up on your Echo Show or your Fire TV. It could be, being able to access some of the Labs content through Alexa and being able to cast the Labs videos to Fire TV or Chromecast. Providing an open API is also a key feature to be able to integrate with other tools and platforms. Though, here, I'm mostly thinking for export purposes. I'd like to keep my data clean within the Halo platform.Below, I'll briefly go through each feature of the Halo platform and share some feedback. It has mostly been positive.ActivityThe auto-tracked activity has been mostly accurate in my case. I haven't really had any issues here. I love the points system based on intensity and heart rate. It makes good sense to me. The same goes for the sedentary time tracking by the minute. I love that. I love to think of it as a game, like Sonic or Mario, where you have to move around the world to collect points. At the same time, the system follows the general guidelines from health authorities. So, the 150 points, then 300 points, etc. makes great sense. The heart rate and resting heart rate tracking have been accurate and consistent here too. Compared to my Garmin Forerunner 645 Music that I've used in the past, the resting heart rate is around the same. Start and end times of auto-tracked activities have been mostly accurate too. Though, it would be nice if it could track more than walking, running, and cycling automatically. But I do also know that it can be hard to figure out what activity people are doing through a sensor. All longer periods of elevated heart rate and movement does however get automatically tracked and added to your activity stream, but then you manually have to select which kind of workout activity you were doing, e.g., yoga or rowing.SleepMy sleeping sessions have been mostly accurate too. Start and end times have been mostly correct. Though, I have had times when I've stayed in bed a bit longer and it has tracked that extra time as still asleep. I can't completely say whether I may have dozed off a few times during that time though. So, it may actually have been accurate still. I've generally experienced that the tracking has improved significantly as I've used the band. Here, I like the score too, and again it seems mostly accurate in my case. I feel refreshed the days the score is high, whereas, I know some things have been off the days the score has been a bit lower. I like the temperature tracking and the fact that it's based on your personal baseline. That makes sense. I like the tracking of sleeping phases, but I'm used to that from other trackers too. Again, it seems mostly accurate.ToneI like the idea of moving into tracking the psychological aspects of life too through features like this. I love when things can be tracked automatically - so, tone tracking is a really great idea. Though, it may also have its limitations, for instance the days that you do not talk as much, or the days where you're mostly by yourself. I like to use Tone for tracking my mood, positivity/negativity, energy levels, and stress levels. How I sound to others is also a great insight. Here, I'd also like a long-term graph, similar to Activity and Sleep. And again, as mentioned earlier, I want to be able to see data as far back as it has been tracked.BodySo far, I've done two body scans. I've followed the recommendations in the app and done a body scan 14 days apart. Both scans I've done so far have seemed accurate in my case. The first scan showed a body fat percentage of 9.5% and the second scan 14 days later showed a percentage of 9.6%. The voice and visual guidance as you're doing the shoots is very helpful and it makes the process a great experience. I love the focus on body composition rather than BMI. I have always been told by other apps that I'm underweight. Which from a BMI perspective, I am. Though, personally, I've more or less always felt great. My doctor has mostly been confirming of this too, as he says ""every body is different"" - the BMI is only based on your height and weight. It's very narrow-sighted to think that you would be able to fit every single human-being into those two metrics. So, again, I'm satisfied with Halo. It shows me that I'm in the healthy / green zone, though in the lower part, but that's not necessarily bad. I have the fat I need, though, I could build some more muscle mass. However, building muscle mass is more a nice to have than need to have. I have what I need to live a happy, healthy, and active life.LabsI still haven't spent much time in this section yet. Though, I do also already have many of the suggestions implemented in my life. Such as listening to ASMR to relax, sleeping around 8 hours a night, etc. Though, I will dig deeper into this section in the future. Something that I would probably like to see is more long-term tracking features. I'd like them to be as automatic as possible to track. Though, something like hydration tracking or nutrition, for instance. But then again, I've used other apps to track these things, I often tend to stick to it for a few weeks, maybe a month, and then I've tend to sort of forget about the tracking again. It takes a lot of time and effort to plot it in manually every day. Though, one tool that I've loved for hydration and nutrition tracking is Cronometer. There you can go very deep into every single vitamin, mineral, types of fat, Omega-3 vs. Omega-6 vs. Omega-9 balance, fiber, alcohol, caffeine, etc. I love seeing those bars fill up as you get all the healthy stuff in.Sensor and BandI got the fabric white/winter version. Additionally, I got a sports band too. Though, I still haven't tried the sports band yet. All in all, the band is very comfortable to wear in my experience. I have a few times felt the bump on the sensor feeling a bit sensitive on my skin. Though, usually that only lasts for a few seconds right after I've taken it on. Usually, I don't really feel that I'm wearing the band throughout the day and night. It's just there and it works.Battery LifeI've had Tone activated the whole time and in the 2-days battery life mode. I do get around the two days as suggested. So, I'm satisfied there. I tend to charge my band whenever I take a shower or bath - which is typically at least every second day. That fits quite fine. One thing that I may be concerned about in the future though is the durability of the charging cable and clip. Not really when used at home, but more if you're going to travel and move around with the charger going in and out of your bags and luggage. I would probably keep the Halo band charger in a separate bag or room to keep it away from clothes, other cables, pressure, etc. that might damage the charger over time.I think that is about it for my review as for now. I'll keep on using it daily and nightly and return with feedback whenever I have it. I really love the openness of Amazon in building and sharing these things through early access and through community efforts like the group on Facebook. I'm looking forward to getting to know even more people in there too and hopefully we can stick together and help each other live satisfying lives with health and wellness at the forefront.",5
2,"I was offered an invite to participate in the early use of this product. I got the product, but was then slightly put off by what I was reading and learning from other early trial people, and now that I've tried it for a couple of days, I can see where I would have been better off not trying this product.=== Updated 25 Feb 2021 ===Received a happy email that my Halo subscription trial (free) has been extended to September 13, 2021!Unfortunately, I returned the Halo band with substantial disappointment, but I had been assured by  Amazon support that the sub would cancel automatically when I returned it.So another F. Can we go negative on stars? Really disappointed, though I would have been livid if I had been charged for it, so I guess the email leading me to check beforehand, while a waste of time, saves me more frustration later.=== Updated 26 Jan 2021 ===Shipped back to Amazon on 25 Jan.Given the quality of the hardware, I would take a look at whatever they come up with next, but Amazon should seriously consider the software user experience and perhaps an open platform (hint: AWS IoT is already a thing).=== Update 21 Jan 2021 ===I have had the Halo band on my right wrist daily and nearly continuously since cracking open the package. I had high hopes then, but no longer.Software for some might be great, but perhaps because I'm a software engineer and I've actually done some minor work with quantified self devices, or maybe it's my experience with more capable smart ""sports watch"" devices, but I'm not impressed at all with the direction the Halo software team went with this.So on the software side- Sleep tracking is hit or miss, mostly miss (I literally get ""--"" most of the time)- The activity score is interesting, but not really useful- If you're opting in to the Tone and Body Composition features, that's 50% of the application home screen view that is never used.- I have never used any of the other Programs, and as I planned not to continue using the paid service, I continue to not be interested in checking them out.- The Insights panel leads to some somewhat useful information sometimes, but I think in general that the Halo application is trying too hard to lead its user down a path (I think this is why my sleep data is not useful).The hardware is good. I would keep this band if the hardware:- were documented- had open tools to access (maybe that's more a software feature, but technically I want to make my own software to make use of the hardware, so it goes here)- had swapped out the mics for blood pressure and/or pulseox measurement (the times we live in, not having these at this price point is ... tone deaf?)- had a more substantial charger (as I mentioned, the charger is slick and unwieldy, and while it does the job, it feels like it will break soon, though kudos on battery life of the band so the charger isn't used too often)Finally part 1, after my initial review, wherein someone from Amazon called me TWICE right after I woke up in the morning (unsolicited, unappreciated, and somewhat creepy on the timing), I have received almost zero feedback on this device, despite my being in some sort of ""early group"" or something. It was difficult to provide any feedback other the review channel here, and with the scant number of Halo mobile application updates, I find myself doubting there will be any improvement coming on the horizon.Finally part 2, downloading the data is cumbersome where it doesn't need to be. If I had confidence that this product would be around for a while, I would almost keep the hardware for the real time heart rate and the temperature readings, except that that makes the band about 2x the price it needs to be for those uses, and I still have to go through the download click, wait, email click, email code, download loop.So, my return cutoff is 31 January, it will be headed back to Amazon before then. A solid first try on the hardware, a swing and a miss on the software, and shaking my head on the data download workflow.=== Update 17 Dec 2030 ===Generic copy-paste support responses with platitudes about me being a valued customer that end with boilerplate requests that I contact support via chat or voice...Returning the product, I liked the hardware, completely disappointed otherwise.=== Update 16 Dec 2020 ===Emailed via the ""Feedback"" part of the mobile application (there are two options, email and phone, given).Received an email response, with suggestions that I use a chat link or call for support... these are the normal Amazon support chat and phone support endpoints so I'm not eager to spend more of my life using these.The fatal flaw, though, the email I received, from an email sender+xyz address (that is, the sender address has a +xyz value, where the xyz is usually a key for tracking an issue ticket, etc), is actually a ""Do Not Reply"" email address. I got an automatic reply, that the response I sent went nowhere. I always find this insulting, as I have here.The data download has two major problems:1. You ""request"" your data. In other words, you aren't holding on to your data, Amazon is. The data sync's from band to mobile device, then mobile device to cloud, and is presumably removed from mobile device. This is unfriendly at best.2. When you receive an email message that your data is ready, that message will contain a link to your data. But you must first enter a 6-digit code, which is sent in a separate email message, to the same email address. This is what we software people call ""security theater.""I have only downloaded one data set so far, the downloaded zip file is not named by date, so presumably the same filename is used for any downloads (this is a problem if you have multiple users sharing a computer, perhaps, or if my download scheme allows file overwriting), so I'll find out next time in a day or two whether the data that I download is ALL data, or incremental data (if it is not incremental, then one might assume that some time in the future the oldest data will be truncated?)I have my package materials, there's >50% chance the Halo Band, which I actually like, is going back due to the software and soft features implementation, which I so far do not.=== Update 15 Dec 2020 ===The charging clip is similar to a clothespin and works fine, but for the very smooth surfaces on the side opposite the ""clip"" such that more than once the charger either snaps back onto the band as the whole thing is launched out of my hands, or it simply launches without clipping... the charger needs some sort of friction texture (not unlike a clothespin again).I have worn the band for full days (I have the default cloth band so not during showering), it is comfortable, unobtrusive (unlike the software), and since it doesn't have any visible display, does not raise any ire when worn with a watch on the opposite wrist.Speaking of unobtrusive, I did receive two phone calls this morning from James at Amazon, concerning this review. Strangely, the calls came only a few minutes after the Halo Band captured my waking up. I forgot to add ""DO NOT CALL ME"" to the review, a mistake I will not make again.=== Original 13 Dec 2020 ===First, the hardware is fine. I have a smart watch, and I have a ""smart sport watch"" that I wear for exercise and quantified self measurements, the minimalist approach here is interesting for things like sleep tracking, for all-day wearing regardless of which watch (or no watch) which means it can be useful to me as part of an overall quantified self effort, so actually see what is working and what isn't as I make quality of life choices.(I should point out here, as an engineer I have learned many times the value of having data to back up and/or correct assumptions, these kinds of quantified self products have a place, if you are someone interested in this entire notion)The 1-star review is for the overall product, which essentially comes down to the software and design thinking around the user experience. Keeping it simple:Pros-----+ Simple and straightforward pairing, data capture+ Nice summary and detail reporting+ Data downloadable+ The ""labs"" feature might be useful for some, though I do not find it appealing. I'll include it as a Pro just in case.Cons------- The Camera-based body composition feature is a non-starter, as has been pointed out in many (if not most) of the reviews I encountered early on. The presumption that a person wants this to be a part of how they will use this product (even though it is opt-in, and fwiw, I did not) is a Miss.- The voice tone feature is ridiculous. I didn't even turn it on, I have zero desire to explore this feature. The audio capture feature of the hardware should be used for sleep quality analysis (snoring, etc), not for voice tone checks. Miss.- As a software engineer in a work-from-home mode, my daily routine does not align with what Halo thinks it should be. Nocturnal sleep schedule? Bi- or Polyphasic sleep schedule? Nap much? Sorry, Halo only counts sleep overnight. Big Miss.- Along a similar line, my activity score gets deductions for being sedentary, but unfortunately I work (at a standing desk, which doesn't count) and then I exercise (and exceed the usual ""heart point"" targets we find in apps like this), but here again, I don't align with Halo's expectations (demands?). Another Miss.- App data doesn't (yet) appear to sync with your general quantified health platform (google fit, for example). Perhaps this would change more easily than re-envisioning an entire set of lifestyle assumptions that drove some bad feature and interface decisions, but for the moment, Halo is a Silo that can spit out a spreadsheet. Miss.- While I can ""Request Download"" of my data, I shouldn't need to do that. This makes the Halo Silo that much more menacing. If the Halo band is syncing data with my mobile device, let me me see my data. Oh, it's syncing with the cloud and I have to ask to see my data... that's another Miss.I will happily update this review if the Halo software improves. I like the hardware for what it is, if I could get my data easily I would use the hardware and keep the software out of my life as much as possible. Maybe check a rolling 24-hour window instead of the typical midnight-aligned notion that most health apps use, or maybe I want to look at my sleep data in my own way...Given my own experience with quantified self (with my two smart watches, associated applications to manage and analyze data from them, and then other sensors and record-keeping for diet and other health measurements), the Halo product overall is a [possibly-recoverable, yet] complete failure.",1
3,"Here is the TLDR: I think this is a potent tool to absolutely transform your body and health. It’s priced perfectly has amazing features that almost anybody can use but isn’t really for people into hard-core fitness or athletes. If you use it as a powerful tool, you’ll see great benefits; just don’t take it too seriously. Now on to the rest of my in-depth review.To really explain this device's ins and outs, I feel I need to explain a little bit of my fitness journey so you can understand what I'm looking for in a device like this. I do this because you can decide if you are like me or not like me, which will help you understand if the Halo is right for you.So I've been on my fitness journey for exactly two years at this point. I started in Feb of 2019, but it wasn't until Aug of 2020 that I really started hitting my stride. Basically, I hired a trainer who helped me consistently track my Macros and hone my diet. I had been doing pretty good with workouts going to the gym.After several months of working with my trainer, I knew it was time for me to do things independently, as hiring a trainer for the rest of my life wasn't an option. So, in November, I let my trainer go and started doing everything on my own.All that being said, I've tried almost every device for fitness and weight loss. The Apple Watch, several other bands, as well as just using my phone. And then I saw Amazon had the Halo coming out. First, I had planned on getting a Whoop band instead, but this is much cheaper, and I thought it might be similar; and I also have great loyalty for Amazon and their devices.So all that being said, here's how it's been for the 3-4 weeks I've been using the Halo. First, battery life is great. That was a big problem I had with the Apple Watch, and I don't want to be charging this thing all the time because I need to be wearing it A LOT. Especially for sleep tracking and workout tracking. It stays good for about 4 days and recharges in 20-30 minutes. That is really great and makes it very convenient to keep it charged and wear it basically all the time.The band itself is comfortable, and after 3 days of wearing it, I forgot it was even there, which is what you want in a band. Although you wear it in a weird place, you get used to that quickly, as I said.Next, I'll talk through all the Halo's functions, which are helpful from a few different standpoints.First, activity tracking. The Halo seems to do an excellent job tracking my heart-rate and using that to track whether I've just been sitting around or whether I'm active in a workout. Based on that tracking, it gives you a score each day. The higher your heart rate for a sustained amount of time, the more points you get. It gives you a constructive goal. The nice thing here is that it will track any activity you do. At first, I was just looking at my workouts, but then I started noticing other times, like playing with my kids or going for a walk with my wife. Stuff that is normally hard to track, but the Halo does it passively, and it's nice to see how active I am throughout the day even when I'm not working out. It also shows you when you've been sedentary—IE, sitting at your desk for at least an hour. Or sitting in bed on your phone! For most people, I think this is really great. It makes things easy to see and simple.But where I'm at, I'd rather like to see how many calories I'm burning throughout the day to use that in my Fitness app to know where I'm at calorie-wise. That information is tracked, but it's hard to find and does not sync to anything, so basically not worth checking and adding into my app. If you are into hardcore fitness (IE Whoop band), you won't like this. But for most people just trying to lose some weight and be healthy, it’s probably good enough.Second, sleep tracking. I've found this incredibly accurate and really helpful. I used to use my Apple watch but had problems with battery life wearing it all night, etc. The Halo does this really well and gives a REALLY clear picture of the times I'm actually asleep, and the times I'm awake or restless. I have RLS, which makes sleep really hard for me many nights. It's something that I've been working through, and the Halo band has really helped me by giving me a clear picture of what's going on with my sleep. The downside here is they say they have ways to help you with sleep, but most of their sleep helps don't seem very helpful. But most of these ""labs,"" as they call them (in the app), are content, so I see them adding more in the future and making them better.Third, body fat percentage tracking. This is probably the most interesting feature of the Halo device/app. It uses your phone's camera to make a 3d model of your body and estimate your body fat percentage. Having been on a two-year fitness journey, I can tell you that weight is a terrible way to determine progress. It fluctuates like crazy based on dozens of inputs (water weight, meals, bowel movements, sleep patterns, meal patterns, gaining muscle, etc.). Given all of that, body fat percentage is THE BEST way to track your progress when you are trying to transform your body. I was looking at a few solutions for this recently, and there are really 3 options. One, pay for a DEXA scan. These are medical and are very accurate, but they cost money, and you may not have a place near you that does them. Also, you wouldn't do it very often given the cost. Second, calipers. These are not very accurate, require someone else to help you, and are very dependent on the other person's skill level in using them. Finally, there have recently been many scales that scan your body as a 3D model and estimate your body fat percentage. These tend to be very expensive, and as I said above, it’s an estimate.Given these are your options for tracking body fat percentage, the 3D model is the best idea. The Halo app seems to do a pretty good job. The scan is made of my body looked somewhat accurate.However, the problem with these is it’s still just estimating your body-fat percentage. That may be something that helps or hurts you. When I did my first scan, it estimated my body-fat very high. But this makes sense given where I’m at in my fitness journey. I’ve been heavily working out to have much muscle, but I still have a good amount of fat to burn off on my body. The scan can’t tell the difference between the muscle and the fat, so it just thinks everything is fat. It’s building its guess of your body-fat percentage based on the measurements it reads and your shape. So, if you are a guy with thick arms and some fat on them, it will most likely think it’s all fat rather than muscle covered in some fat.If you JUST use this feature to track your progress and don’t get too caught up in the actual number it gives you, I think this could be a huge help. I can't tell you how many times in my journey I’ve gotten stuck on the number the scale is giving me and let it derail me for days at a time. This could do that as well, but if you just use it to track weekly progress, I think that is absolute GOLD. The app says only to scan once every two weeks, and I think that is perfect timing. My advice would be to start your fitness journey or are in the middle looking to keep going, and you should use this number as your method for tracking progress.Basically, I plan to scan myself every two weeks and use that amount my body fat percentage drops as my way of knowing how well I’m doing and what’s working. Instead of tracking my weight every week as I have been. If I can see a consistent amount of body fat drop in the app every two weeks, I’ll know the app is working well and that I’m following my plan as well.Hopefully, that helps as you think about your fitness journey and transforming your body. The only other thing I’ll say is to do it! Get this device to start your journey and change your life. It is worth all the blood, sweat, and tears you’ll face along the way. And the Halo can be a huge help and a powerful tool on that journey.",4
4,"5/30/22From start to finish I will continue to update this review for the next 6 months on and off.Yesterday when I got my band I needed to install the app twice to get the verification to send out to my email so I could clear that part and pair the bracelet with my phone. Afterwards I sat down to explore the app just to discover that my 6 month free trial was not active so I did what anyone would do, I went to my subscriptions @ Amazon.com and it showed Halo was there but it was paused. I could activate it for $3.99... alright phone call time. 2 phone calls later they figured it out that it was a technical issue and the only way to resolve it was for me to purchase the membership and for them to refund it every month by me calling in. Great extra work for me.... moving on, things happen.Skip this if you don't want to hear about me.I am 5'7 185ish lbs I want to lose the little bit of extra weight that I have and tone up so I'd say I'm a bit dedicated and I actually have time to do workouts but I am admittedly out of shape in the endurance and stamina areas. I've been a bit of a couch potato in recent times (thanks covid). Now I am ready to rise up to the challenge and push past my limits to get my health back in check so I thought this would be a great start.I put my band on where they suggested found some exercises for cardio, too my pre-workout drink, stretched, and got started. Afterwards I checked the live heart rates to see how intense mine was because I was feeling the burn, trust me... the inaccuracies I saw saying my HR was only 80-85 was troublesome to say the least. That is not possible for someone who just put their all into a cardio workout to have that low of a HR.The big problem with it is that Halo gives you a point value based on how intense your workout is and that inaccurate number made my number pretty low for the workout. That is one of the biggest complaints I have seen in these reviews about how discouraging this app can be to people who are making efforts to get healthy. So I agree they need to be more accurate.Move youre monitor to a better reading position under your arm (like where nurses and doctors take your pulse). You get more accurate reading there. We will see how day 2 goes tomorrow.6/2/22So for some reason my review did not update on 5/31 and I did not post yesterday. To sum it up I have moved my band and posted a picture of where I moved it to. I also did the same cardio workout and yes they do give you a base amount of points for doing the workout but they also give you activity points depending on how your heart rate was during the activity. This is where the importance of accuracy comes into play. From default position with the band (what I thought was inaccurate) to where I moved the band to, on the same workout around the same time of day with the same pre-workout boost, I had an 8 point difference in activity points. 8 points in 1 activity that took 20 minutes is a lot of points in my opinion for an inaccurate reading.I do want to mention that Amazon did reach out to me and they were concerned about the inaccurate reading that I posted about. I was very happy to have this type of appreciation. I did suggest that they include a preview of the vidoes because some of the descriptions that you get when you are looking for a  workout or yoga is not enough to make your decision on and the only thing you can do is start the video and go into it. That can be a huge waste of people's time if it is not what they are looking for or is too advanced for them.This is how easy it is for me to meet the weekly goal and how much I love the Halo band so far... I am a stay at home dad, father of 4 kids, only 2 are in school.  We try to walk to school to drop them off and pick them off, depending on weather and if they get their lazy butts moving that day or not, it is just under a mile walk there so we can call it 2 miles for me there and back (25ish points). The yoga doesn't reward people with points for competition (I don't like that) some yoga does get your HR going and yoga can be a workout. Anyways, I have no problem dedicating 10-20 minutes outside of my walks to doing a workout, whether that is strength or cardio depends on how I am feeling. Those workouts can range from 10 points up to 40 points. Now stay with me here. This Halo band sets a small goal of 150 points for people to meet each week. I cut the grass yesterday with my assisted push lawnmower... yes I did have to go into my Halo app and start a live walk for it to record that I was doing it, that was 50 points in itself. What I'm getting at here is simple the goal of 150 points a week is so easy to meet if you are actually dedicated to TRYING to stay healthy. I am only 4 days in this week and only have done 20 minutes of workouts a day besides my walks and yoga and I am about to hit 300 points already.Besides the troubles I had to go through the first day, the next 3 days with Halo have been very enjoyable for me. IF there is more trouble or love that come up as I go on I WILL come back and post again. I really hope this is enough to get motivation to some people out there. Just dedicate 10-20 minutes a day and remember that it will keep you healthy. I am doing it for me and my kids. Think about what you should do it for, you and what else? Just don't forget it is got to be almost 100% for you but never hurts to have a second motivator like I do.",4
5,"Having sifted through the numerous reviews for the Amazon Halo, I decided to throw my opinion into the fray.The Amazon Halo is Amazon's first attempt at a wearable health tracking device and for a first attempt it's an above average product. Having worn the bad for roughly 2 months, here is my experience.Sleep 4/5: My biggest concern when applying for the beta testing was the idea of wearing something on my wrist when sleeping with concerns of it being more of an annoyance preventing me to sleep rather than being a helpful tracking device; I was wrong. That isn't to say that it's 100% unnoticeable but it since day 1 I have not had any significant issues with wearing the Halo while sleeping. I wear it a bit looser while sleeping to provide some give and the fit is 100% customizable thanks to the velcro strap.The tracking itself is average I would say, having had a few nights with nightmare issues the Halo recognized these as disturbances in my sleep and this was reflected in my overall sleep score. On a side note, seeing that you received a high score is almost like a cup of coffee in the morning. A pseudo-side effect I'm sure but mind of matter, right? I will say that the sleep tracking presents you with the most basic of information, if you are looking for in-depth analysis then the Halo is not for you.Exercise 3/5 - Like sleep, it will present you will the most basic of information such as heart BPM, step counter, total time and the intensity of the workout. The issue I see for many is that the data is not readily available on your wrist. For me, this was advantageous as I did not want another notification machine on my wrist as I have with my Apple Watch (which I wear opposite of the Halo).With a lack of in depth analysis and the user having to use a separate device (your phone) to access the data the Halo is collecting, I can understand why this would be an issue for some.I personally like the Halo not having a screen but admittedly the data available is rudimentary that most smart phone come with already.Tone 3/5 - Unfortunately, I view this as more of a gimmick than a feature to be taken serious at this stage. I was initially really excited about this feature and interested to see what ""others hear"" while I'm speaking. My problem here is that some days I have 3 ""notable moments"", other days I'm in the high 30's. The reason I see this as an issue is my days are fairly routine with the same type of interactions day in and day out. The other aspect of this is the way the data is presented. Now I understand the fear of voice recordings and privacy concerns (although let's be honest, we all have willing put microphones and cameras in our pockets and our homes) but to say I was ""curious"" at 9:10AM for 5.1 seconds gives me nothing to work of off to improve my tone. The best this feature can achieve is providing you general data on your tone for the day which has its value but once again do not look for in depth analysis. I will say it is fun to joke around how ""amused"" your tone is when you are speaking your friends when compared to how ""irritated"" your tone is when with your girlfriend!Body Scans 4/5 - This is the tough pill to swallow in all of this and something most of us probably did not have access to on a regular basis and this might very well be the crowing feature of the Halo. The Halo will ask you to take photos of your body (Amazon says they are secure and to not worry but who really knows, you are already sending nasty stuff to the person you met on Tinder so what's the difference) and based of these photos the app will calculate your Body Mass Index or BMI which is consider to be a more accurate deciphering of your health. The app will calculate your body fat percentage and based off your weight, height and age will determine if you are in a healthy range. Most of us know we can do better and the app isn't shy when it comes to the truth, its really what we do with this data that will determine how much value the Halo brings into our lives.I gave this 4/5 because I cannot compare this to what a medical professionals scan would result in but it seems accurate.All Other Aspects 4/5 - The design of the Halo itself is sleek and simple with just a single button. Other devices might give you more in depth, real time analysis but with screens and notifications they can be overwhelming. I have read some reviews where the user says the band is not secure and the metal case of the device ""slams into my wrist bone""... First off this made me laugh as the device weighs close to nothing and couldn't possible produce a slamming effect on the most sensitive of individuals but more importantly the bands are very secure and unless worn intentional loose will be fine.There are a variety of colors of bands to choose coming in both a fabric and silicon. The fabric cleans easily as we all as the silicon. I think they are a bit expensive but I would suggest purchasing a silicon strap for intense work outs as to not dirty the fabric strap. Most are currently showing a 4-6 week shipping time frame. Uncharacteristic of Amazon but with the ongoing pandemic I'm sure production and shipping deadlines were thrown out the window.The app itself has many cool features such as a myriad of labs (weekly experiments and challenges to push you to sleep or exercise more efficiently) to choose from in the discover tab. There is also a live feature where you can get real time tracking on the tone of your voice and your current BPM.The charging clip is a bit of an oddity and not as easy to use as others. The clip has to fit just write for the Halo to charge properly and there is nothing within the clip itself to line up the device with the charger. Some days you can take 30 seconds just trying to line up the device so it begins to charge. This is probably the biggest hardware issue with the Halo and is absolutely something Amazon needs to reimagine.The battery life lasts about 2 days but will drain much faster if the microphone is always active. Another aspect of the device that Amazon will have to look into if they continue to push Tone as a key feature in the 2.0 version as key features shouldn't have such a detrimental effect on the battery life. My girlfriend turned her microphone off and the device lasted for 4 days with no charge!For $100, the Amazon Halo is not a bad choice for those looking for basic health tracking information and a way to motivate you to get your steps in. The data does not provide a lot of depth and for first attempt the Halo does many things above average. It's a fun, inexpensive device that I wear and check in daily. I would recommend it if you are looking for general info or are new to the wearable device game. Could also be a good device for children to teach them the importance of health and exercise since the app is pretty straight forward and uncomplicated, the no screen feature will prevent distractions during school time. As with anything else, the value will really be how you use it and what you do with the information is provides.",4
6,"I think I need some more time to give this device a full review, but I've had it for 2 weeks now as it replaced one of my previous fitness bands as my life insurance company offered me this device for free with a 3 year subscription.  I'll give you my first thoughts/impressions:First and foremost, about the design:  while I understand that it's supposed to be an inconspicuous device; I can't stand that it doesn't have a clock.  I really got used to all my prior devices having one.  For me, I really wish it had an option to display a clock.  Other than that, the actual hardware is a bit thicker than I'd prefer.  I wear it right above my wrist bone, but it can be really uncomfortable for me to sleep with, especially since I'm a side sleeper that often puts their hand under their pillow.  The fabric band while fairly comfortable gets dirty quickly.The app:  I have no true complaints here.  It works well, and there are a decent amount of features especially if you have a subscription.  Having access to so many workouts is a big plus as well as ""workout programs"" to follow.  I've enrolled myself in a 21 day yoga program which I am really enjoying so far.  The amount of companies you can get workouts from is impressive, there's definitely something for everyone here.  Having access to meditation sessions, tone improvement programs, it's all very interesting and not necessarily something that other apps have.  The overall app layout is pleasant, easy to use, and works well on my phone.The accuracy:  That's always a hard thing to measure.  So, compared to my prior fitness watch the steps do seem to be accurate in comparison.  I'm not really sure about my heart rate, but my resting seems to be around 70, and compared to my prior device that seems to be around the same as well.  It is missing oxygen saturation and some other features other devices have a leg up on, but that doesn't personally bother me.  I wouldn't doubt that if Amazon decides to continue this device, that the next one will have these features.  It is nice that it auto-tracks your activities, but honestly I was surprised at how many ""points"" it gives me throughout my day.  To my fault, I haven't been an entirely active person lately.  I do desk work, but I do often get up and move around doing other chores which it logs for me as activity since my heart rate goes up during some of those chores like cleaning for example.  It will subtract points for excessive sedentarianism...?? lol that's not a word but you know what I mean.  That's actually motivating for me.  I don't want to lose points, so I have been challenging myself to get up and move around more often.  I easily get 150 points a week (the goal it's set for me automatically) without exercising. That's a bit weird to me...I didn't expect to get close to meeting that goal being that I haven't been actually walking/doing yoga/etc.  While that's nice, I don't know how I feel about that..especially since I have been going a bit over the amount of sedentary time they suggest.  After reading some of the reviews my issue seems to be the opposite of others not getting enough credit for the activities they do.  I'm a bit confused about this.With that being said, I am also confused as to why I didn't get any points for doing one of the yoga activities they have in the app.  I had to manually add it?  It was only one point when I did that, and it seems to go off of the time you enter that you did it and then match that to your heart rate.  OK I get it, the yoga I did wasn't strenuous so one point seems about right for 20 minutes.  I just wanted it to automatically log it.  It automatically logged one of the other exercises I did in the app, so I'm wondering why.The Tone feature:  Interesting, to say the least.  I'm really interested in how I come across to people and how tone affects how we interact with people so I did like trying this out.  Unfortunately it's a battery killer!  I got barely 2 days of use while using the tone feature.  I also was surprised to see that I rarely sound angry or annoyed in a typical day.  That was a relief haha.  It gives you insights on when you sounded a certain way that was noteworthy, but unfortunately doesn't tell you what words it picked up on that made it feel that way.  That would be nice to know.  I did have to turn the constant tone feature off though because it really just wasn't worth killing the battery so fast over.Sleep:  Another interesting feature, though I'm not sure how I feel about it yet.  I know it's a hard thing to measure, and I've only gotten to use it a few times so far.  It did accurately pick up when I woke up for more than 5 minutes, though one night recently I thought I had a great sleep and it said NOPE, not so much, your sleep was ""fair"", take it easy today.  I didn't particularly feel unrested, but they do note that everyone is unique and just because the app says you didn't have a good sleep if you feel ok, you feel ok.  I'm not sure how often I'll use this because honestly the device bothers me a bit when I'm laying down.  I hate wearing things on my wrist when sleeping.Movement:  You have the option to do a quick 10 minute exercise in order to check your mobility, stability and posture.  It gave me what I felt were fair results (okay mobility, good stability and good posture).  After my assessment it gave me 2 weeks of corrective exercises to do that are super quick.  You check in again after the 2 weeks to see if you have made some improvements.  Interesting feature but not life changing for me, yet at least.I can't speak for the body scan, I'm not brave enough to do it yet but I will test it soon.Overall I think I like it more of course due to the fact that I have a subscription and it ties into my life insurance benefits/points earning - I'll be honest w/ you when I say that.  It gives me a slight bias I think.  Would I have bought this on my own?  I had thought about it a while ago but not sure if I would have gone through with it.  Now that I have it and I'm using it, so far I do enjoy it and have more pros than cons.",4
7,"Updated:Original Review - I bought a Halo for myself, and at first, I really liked it. But I have had a mounting series of defects. The first thing I noticed is the charging clip is poorly designed. To charge your Halo, you have to insert it into this goofy clip and you have to fiddle with the band to get the charging contacts to line up properly with the contacts on the clip. This was a minor inconvenience, but one that I have to deal with every 2 days when I need to charge my Halo. The first major issue was about 2 weeks after I had set up and started using my Halo. It just quit synchronizing. I contacted the Halo support team, and they told me I would need to reset my Halo. I did, and that not only erased all the data from the device (as expected), but also from the app. So I set my Halo up as if it was brand new once again. I hadn't used the body scan to calculate my BMI, so about a week after the factory reset, I though I would set up the body scan. The scan wouldn't work. It failed every time. You have to position the front facing camera of your phone so that it can scan your body and the app has a helpful feature to show you exactly how to position your phone and you can see yourself on the screen. That part worked, but the app simply would not start the scan. So once again I contacted Halo support, and they said the instructions in the app are ""misleading"" because they say you can do the body scan without having the cloud backup turned on, but this is incorrect and you MUST all your Halo to send your device data to the cloud for the scan to work. OK, I was fine with that but put off doing the scan until a later time. Then, early this week, my Halo stopped synchronizing with the app. My Halo is fully charged, connected to my app (the app ""sees"" my Halo), but it won't sync. After 2 days of it not syncing, I noticed that several of the features in the app also were not working. For example, if I tapped the sleep or voice tone section of the app and then tapped the ""week"" or ""month"" tab to view data before my Halo stopped synchronizing, the app would say ""something went wrong. We're on it"" and it displayed a picture of a cat. I once again contacted Halo support. They said I would have to do another factory reset. SI wasn't happy about that because I would once again lose all of my data (they really want you to back up your profile/data to the cloud) and set up my Halo all over again. I decided to wait another day for a convenient time to do the reset. Last night, I prepared to reset my Halo, only when I opened the app, there was an error message saying ""Something changed on your account"" and the app displayed instructions to double press the button on the device until the light flashed, go into my phone's settings and ""remove"" the device, and set up the Halo again using the app. I did both steps and the Halo app automatically launched the ""Let's set up your Halo"" process. I entered all of my information, logged into my Amazon account, and the app said that it was sending me a 6-digit code via a text message and that I would need to enter it in the app to complete setup. No problem. I received the text after about 2 seconds, entered the code and . . . the app said the code was incorrect. I checked, and I had entered it correctly. I tried again. Same result. I tapped the link to ""resend the code."" Within about 2 seconds, I received a new, different code. I entered that into the Halo app and . . . it again said the code was incorrect.  I tried two more times with the same result, and after trying to enter the fourth code, the app said ""Too many unsuccessful attempts. You can try again in an hour."" I had also purchased a Halo for my wife. She had not tried to set up the BMI scan, and had only done the basic setup and was using the fitness, sleep, and voice tone features. Everything was fine until a couple of days ago when her Halo also stopped synchronizing with her app (the same day as mine stopped synchronizing). She also decided to wait until I got mine to sync, so she put hers on the charger. She kept trying to get the contacts to line up, but could not get her band to recharge no matter what. So at this point, I can say that the Halo bands have promise, but our experience has been frustrating, to say the least. I want to return both of our Halo bands, but of course, we're two weeks past the return window for hers and four weeks past the return window for mine, so right now we have two $99 decorative wrist straps.Pros:- The fabric band is comfortable and the velcro makes it easy to adjust to just the right size, as long as you order the correct size band (see below)- the Halo itself is fairly low profile and light weight, so it's mostly comfortable to wear- The Halo charges quickly. It will go from 5% to 100% in about 30 minutes- Halo support team is responsive and friendly- I really like the fitness activity scoring, sleep analysis, and the voice tone analysis (though it's really hard to earn ""smiley"" faces). The fitness scoring and sleep analysis in particular are far superior to what other wearable devices have. Halo measures intensity and scores you accordingly (and deducts points for inactivity), whereas smart watches only track steps and calories, or the duration of your sleep.Neutral:- Brand new, the Halo holds a charge for about 48 hours. After 6 weeks of use, I get about 42 hours of use before I have to charge it.Cons:- The app and the Halo have bugs. I have had to do two factory resets on mine and one on my wife's, both of our devices stopped synchronizing, the BMI scan instructions are misleading (though they may have since changed them), and the app has randomly disconnected from our account and we cannot complete setup- The device description / guidelines for choosing a band are misleading. If you are near the upper limit for the ""medium"" band, order the large. I used a cloth measuring tape to determine which band to order, and the medium band should have sufficed according to the description, but it was far too tight.- The charging clip is a poor design. You constantly have to fiddle with the Halo and the clip to get the charging contacts to align. Why a goofy clip anyway? Why not a magnetic connecter like every other wearable device?- Both of our Halos stopped synchronizing and setup in the app no longer works- One of our two Halo devices will not charge at allWould I buy Halo again? No. Not until they fix the numerous bugs in the app, redesign the charging clip, and fix the charging issue. Hopefully I can get Amazon to let us return these two Halos for a full refund.UPDATE - After posting this review, a member of the Halo support team called me and offered to do some detailed troubleshooting. The person was very helpful and detailed. We spent well over an hour and were unable to get the Halo app and Halo band to work. The support person said they would need to submit a ticket to the Halo engineering team to troubleshoot further. A few days later, I received an email from the Halo support team asking for permission to access my Halo profile. I replied to the email, but received a bounce-back saying that email address does not accept replies. There was no other information in the original email about alternative ways to contact the Halo support team to give them permission to access my Halo profile. A few days later, I received yet another email once again asking for my permission to access my Halo profile, Again I replied to the email, and once again received a bounce-back message. A few days later I received a voice mail also asking for my permission for the Halo engineering team to access my profile to troubleshoot, but no way to return the call. Several more days have passed, so I finally tried initiating a chat with customer support. The chat bot was . . . frustrating . . . because it kept asking me if I wanted help with an Echo Device, Kindle e-reader, Fire TV, Fire Tablet, or Something Else. Since Halo doesn't seem to fit any of the first four categories, I clicked Something Else. Then the chat bot asked whether I needed help with Dash, Cloud Cam or No, Something Else. So I clicked on No, Something Else. Then the chat bot asked me to type more information about what I needed help with, so I typed ""Amazon Halo,"" and once again, the chat bot asked if I wanted help with an Echo Device, Kindle e-reader, etc. After going through this pointless circle again, I clicked on the icon of a person, and was able to chat with a customer service representative. From there I was finally able to work out a return for a full refund.",1
8,"I have been using my Halo band for 3.5 months, and I am very happy with some features, and very disappointed with others.The Good:- Activity tracking is perfect.Focusing on activity points per day and per week is an ideal balance of flexibility and simplicity.  You get 1 point for every 30 seconds of intense activity (working out), 1 minute of moderate activity (going for a walk), or 10 minutes of light activity (puttering around the house).  Your goal is 150 points per week.  This has been so easy to internalize, and it makes more sense than an arbitrary ""10,000 steps/day"" goal.  Some days you're a little lazy; other days you're nice and active, and that balances each other out over the week compared to a daily ""pass/fail"" criteria in other fitness trackers.  For example, yesterday was a very sedentary day for me; at 8pm I only had 7 activity points when I'm usually in the twenties.  So I did a workout video on YouTube for 25 minutes and got my score up into the 30's.  Compare that to when I used a Fitbit: If I only had 4,000 steps at 8pm I would consider the day lost and not even try to get to 10k.Regarding accuracy, I will frequently wear the Halo band along with my Garmin watch and the heartrate and step counters seem to match very well.- Sleep tracking is also great.Every night you get a sleep score from 1-100 and my number seems to track with how I feel in the morning.  Score of 86: nice!  Score of 62: oof, let's try to take a nap today.  There is more detail about how much time you spent in each sleep stage of the sleep cycle, your sleep efficiency, body temp, etc. if you want to dive deeper.  Like the activity tracking, they have struck a great balance of simplicity, accuracy, and depth.  The only thing missing here is the ability to track a nap in addition to the regular night's sleep.- The band itself is very comfortable.I forget I'm wearing it most of the time.  I sleep with it without any issue.  I put it on the charger while I take a shower and that is usually enough.  Sometimes the fabric gets damp when I sweat a lot, but it dries quickly and does not smell.The Bad:- The body scans are frustrating, inaccurate, and unhelpful.I was really interested in getting a more accurate picture of my health by using the body scans.  The feature is advertised as ""twice as accurate"" as biometric scales, and it seemed like an interesting approach to health tracking.  Unfortunately it has been next to useless in practice.First of all, the body fat estimation is incredibly inaccurate.  This has been reported by published reviews, and backed up by my doctor.  I am a relatively slim guy in my 30's.  I'm 5' 10"", 185lbs and wear size 33"" pants.  According to Halo my body fat% is 28.6%, almost at the top of the range, and well into the ""dangerous"" zone.  Every other test/tool I've used estimates my % in the teens.Secondly, the scans rarely work, which is frustrating given the hassle it is to take them.  I have to strip to my underwear, adjust the lighting in the room, balance my phone on a stool, make sure the volume is up and the app is ready, then stand back to hold a pose in 4 positions.  I do all this, and it only accepts the scan 1 out of every 6 tries.  It never gives any info on why the scan fails.  I just have to try again tomorrow.  With every app update, I hope they will resolve this issue, but they haven't.- The tone tracking is an interesting concept, but ultimately useless.I was fascinated to try out the tone tracking, and when I tested it out in real time it seemed to do a good job of categorizing the ""mood"" of how I was talking.  The Halo will make note of any ""notable moments"" through out the day where I sounded ""amused"" or ""restrained"" or ""friendly"" etc.  It will also compile what percentage of my speech is high/low energy and positive/negative each day.  And then... that's it.  There's nothing actionable to do with this data, and there is no trend information or even a chart showing how certain days compared to others.  You can try to look at an hourly chart of an individual day, but you can't zoom into any granular information or out to see what the overall day was.  Even when I tried to look at some specific interactions I couldn't find anything helpful.  ""Was I too harsh with the kids this evening?""  ""How did I come across when I was talking politics with my friend around 1pm?""  I couldn't tell at all.I am allowing this device to listen to me all day and this app to have pictures of me in my underwear, and I am deriving no benefit from either.- There are a ton of ""Labs"" to help you start healthy habits, but their implementation sucks.Monitoring is important, but I was also looking forward to having some tools to help me actually be healthier.  Unfortunately the Labs they offer are half-baked.  Many of them don't do anything more than remind you to do something, and you can only be reminded once per day.  I did an ""eat healthier"" lab that essentially just told me to try eating vegetables at lunch and dinner, and it would ask me if I did it at the end of the day.  I'm doing a meditation one which has actually been pretty good (you listen to a helpful guide while you try to meditate for 5-6 minutes each day) except that if I don't fit a session into my morning, I have to leave the reminder up on my phone all day because there's no way to prompt you more than once.There are a lot of exercise videos which I thought would be helpful, but there is no way to just watch a single video.  You have to start a specific exercise Lab which is a series of videos that you're supposed to do over 2-4 weeks.  If I wanted to do a HIIT workout one morning, and then maybe find a stretching routine the next evening, I would have to jump through the hoops of starting (and then cancelling) a related Lab, and then cross my fingers that one of those videos has something I want to do right now.  Furthermore, even if I wanted to do an exercise Lab they won't let you check off your progress manually; they will only track if you watched the video.  So I did a yoga class instead of doing the yoga Halo video that day?  Tough cookies, it will count as a missed day for the Lab.- The app in general is disorganized.Now that I know where everything is, the app is fine.  But there is so much clutter and inconsistency between each section.  Plus I feel like I am constantly scrolling past Labs recommendations to get to what I'm actually looking for.- Options for linking to other services s a jokeI was hoping I could tie this to my Google Fit or Garmin app since I also use those to track my exercise.  However the only services Halo will connect with are Weight Watchers and John Hancock Vitality (whatever that is).Conclusion:I paid $65 for the device via an early access promotion, and I honestly think that's a good value for the activity and sleep tracking.  I am still really pleased with those.  However, I am extremely disappointed in the body scan, tone tracking, and Labs features.  If I had to spend $100 to get the device today I doubt I would pull the trigger.  If I have to start paying for the features I like in the Halo app, forget it.  I'll just get a Fitbit.",3
9,"I bought Halo coming from FitBit and iWatch experience for many years.  After now using for 2+ Months, I find Halo behaves more like a life coach keeping you ""on target"" for exercise fitness & activity, health, diet/nutrition and wellbeing (mindfulness/meditation/sleep), rather than being an interactive real time device.  While Halo collects real-time data to accomplish this (heart rate, intensity, sleep, temperature and tonality), the value-add is really the extensive packaging of the app to be a one-stop-shop for access to everything you need to track your activity, exercise intensity, dietary intake, sleep patterns, voice tonality and mindfulness with meditation.  Halo provides a LOT of in-app fitness videos and short clips from 8fit, SWEAT, Openfit and meditation by Headspace and Relax Melodies - hence the subscription based service.  Halo is a retroactive tool, rather than real-time, enabling you to proactively manage your life. Based on your readings of tonality, activity, sleep and body scans, Halo-App recommends ""courses"" and training videos in meditation for sleep and tonality and fitness videos to help you improve and keep active, and enables you to setup reminders to drink, eat-well, take exercise and meditate - all within the app. Having everything related to your wellbeing in one place (the app), is a competitive advantage of Halo, in my opinion.So what's really ""new"" and what does the actual wrist ""device"" do differently to say an iWatch or Fitbit?  Tonality monitoring is truly different and a new feature. It's been accurate for me both in monitoring personal conversations and business meetings. Value add is it helps you focus on remaining ""measured"" during conversations and generally helps you become more aware of how you sound.  Example - I was more angry on certain weekly meetings than I realized. Sleep monitoring with skin temperature monitoring is new with Light, REM and Deep sleep analysis, as is Halo's points system for computing the intensity of your workouts based on heart rate readings.  But nothing else is new or groundbreaking that the ""device"" does itself.So what's truly ""new"" with the app?The groundbreaking new feature is the visual body scan with your phone camera that computes your body fat.  I find it useful tracking my body progress for losing fat as I utilize the in-app training programs to keep myself healthy.  Tonality monitoring will give you ""notable moments"" of key tones used throughout the day to highlight where your tone generally is at (calm/happy - neutral - sad/angry), and the sleep analyzer with temperature is more comprehensive than the app I use on iWatch.  Being able to manage health reminders in the app and the suggestions on keeping healthy with the videos and articles being in one place is very useful and time saving.Pros:- The app is really where the innovation and differentiation is.  Having all that info, monitoring and video coaches allows you to manage your fitness and wellbeing easily in one place and one app- Body scan for body fat is new and a clever visual innovation, and adds another new visual measure to BMI and weighing yourself- Battery life is good (no screen!), and with tonality on all the time I got about 2.5 days of battery and 5-6 days with tonality turned off- I found tonality, extra sleep insights and intensity points system useful and new for tracking my activity, for example a simple reminder to take the 2 minute morning exercise video keeps you on track, especially if you're sitting in front of a computer screen all day - the app really helps you get moving and gives you that ""coach/mentor"" push. Yes you can do this manually with reminders,  but the app takes out that manual administration of it- I use the meditation app a lot in mornings and evenings, having all the headspace programs available is very helpful, and a positive feature for having the ""subscription"" service, and keeps you mindful before starting and then ending your day- In-app coaching videos and training quality is greatly enhanced by having the subscription service.  It provides you access to good quality videos.  Yes you can watch YouTube video's for any of these fitness/wellbeing areas of your life but Halo truly makes this available in one place, and recommends programs based on your own data measurements.- It's comfortable enough a fit for me on my wrist, I use it 24x7 (as with my iWatch).  Choose the right band size.Cons:- I like to check my heart rate, workout time and clock time when exercising - you cannot do this with Halo as there's no screen.  Yes the app has a ""live"" monitor but you're just not going to get your phone out when exercising/running to do this, when I can just tap my iWatch.- You'll have to wear two devices if you want to get realtime info via touch from iWatch or Fitbit (or other), and then utilize Halo.  You do get used to it quickly though (~3 weeks), but it's another device to track/upgrade/charge weekly.- No screen obviously saves battery, but does mean you conduct everything on your phone and through the app. This is initially frustrating if you're used to just tapping your iWatch and accessing things right on your wrist.- Apart from tonality and sleep temp monitoring, An iWatch ""device"" does everything the Halo does, and has all of your most widely used apps on it, so Halo has no extra features beyond tonality monitoring.- With no screen, everything is done in the app, the Halo just becomes an accessory you wear and after 3-weeks I did find you forget about it, and is just an enabler for data collection.- I'm not so sure the program recommendations use enough of your data measurements to (yet) provide a really focused and personalized set of programs - the recommendations appear very generic (but still really good).Summary:Is Halo worth it?  Personally I think the app itself is worth the price, and having the high quality training video's for meditation, fitness, relaxation melodies, body scan and reminders / insights in a single app is something I am truly using every day to keep myself in better shape across all areas of my life (well being (mental health) in addition to physical health). The device itself is just a data collector and Amazon could just have easily written the app for the iWatch or Fitbit (although tonality would be lost). I'd like to see Amazon enhance the device in the future but the app is groundbreaking and targets a very different market.  It's Amazon's first foray into this type of device and the device itself and app still has that ""first release"" feel about it. Everyone is different and deciding on whether to get Halo will weigh heavily on what you're using already and like/don't like, so like using/learning anything new you will need to spend time getting used to it.  If you're not sure Halo is for you I'd suggest getting Halo, immersing yourself in using it for 30 days, and if you still don't like it, return it - then you have lost nothing but a bit of time and more insight into what you like and don't :-)",4
10,"Was really looking forward to this until I read the Washington Post review. Which you should read before buying, because it eviscerates this device.BUT...I had already ordered it; it was too late to stop the shipment, and so, it came and I tried it.I am an overweight woman who works as an adjunct professor.Currently I am working from home doing classes on zoom.I have been using this time (where I don’t have to drive to a bunch of different colleges) to work on exercise.Since August, I have gone from completely sedentary, to running 3 miles a day.I got my halo in the mail, and I put it on, and I set it up, and I got up in the morning and ran my 3 miles.It gave me nine points for my 3 mile run.Even if ran my 3 miles seven days a week, I would never get to the 150 points it says I need.And currently I only run five days a week.BUTAND EVEN WORSEAfter I ran and showered and all that kind of stuff, I sat down to do my day of zoom teaching.In between zoom teaching I ran up and down the stairs to let the dog outtook the dog for a walkwent to pick up the mailbut basically spent about seven hours teaching on zoom.By the end of the day my nine points had dropped down to three. :(In my current situation, there is nothing else I can do, after I finish teaching, I have a child to take care of I have a husband I have dinner to cook I have things to do.Doing those things did not raise my score above the measly three points.And so, I have never been so unmotivated in my life to continue exercise that it has been very very challenging for me to achieve.This is the most unmotivating thing I have ever encountered.It is an anti-cheerleader.And I can tell you that I was never going to upload photos, either naked or otherwise, becauseI don’t want to be further shamed by this device.I was really disappointed to get it and to find out that in order to do the fat analysis you had to upload photos of yourself.I was hoping that it somehow measured your fat through the connectivity of your skin, but I guess that’s just sci-fi stuff that hasn’t happened yet.In any case, when someone like me has gone from zero exercise, to participating in 5Ks for the first time in her life, what that person doesn’t need, is a device like this, that tells you that this is a worthless effort.What a person like me doesn’t need is something that punishes you by subtracting points.I can see that the hard-core exercised obsessed would like this, Maybe even teach the band to call them a worthless maggot or something.For me, I need something kinder and gentler. I have decided to just repeatedly sign up for any local 5Ks that are happening as a way to encourage myself to continue training. It’s a much better use of the money as the money goes to charities, and not Amazon. And they don’t make me feel ashamed of my pitiful effort.",1
11,"Una reseña en español.Luego de una semana de uso con la Amazon Halo Band aquí les diré que es lo bueno y lo malo de ella.1) Empezaremos por lo físico de la banda. Es realmente cómoda al usar, pedí la banda de tamaño small, tengo muñecas muy finas  y no he sentido ningunas molestias en sentido general. la versión que pedí fue con la correa negra de tela y en verdad que aguanta el paso de los días sin ensuciarse, si mantener la pulsera limpia es importante para tí esta sin lugar a duda es tu mejor opción.No he tenido reacciones alérgicas al material ni nada por el estilo pero siempre es recomendable el lavado por lo menos dos veces al día del área debido a que estas acumulan polvo y sudor.2) Carga/cargador: Realmente no entiendo porqué los fabricantes tecnológicos más grande del mundo se empeñan en lanzar productos con cargadores propietarios.En el caso de la Halo Band el cargador es de tipo clip, los primeros 3 días la experiencia para cargar la pulsera fue TERRIBLE, a tal punto que prefería no cargar la banda hasta que estuviera en 10% para no tener que durar más de 10 minutos intentando que encendiera el led rojo. Al 4to día me dí cuenta que NO ES RECOMENDABLE poner a cargar la banda con la correa puesta, este era el principal motivo por el que la banda duraba tanto en poder cargar, AMAZON por favor ser más específico en las instrucciones de la misma. Luego de este proceso de aprendizaje debo decir que la carga no es diferente al de la XIAOMI MI BAND 4, es quitar la correa y conectar al cargador.¿Son rápidos los tiempos de carga? Si, la verdad es que la banda en realidad carga bastante rápido, en 40 minutos casi en la totalidad de las veces me ha cargado la banda, siempre la pongo en la mañana cuando preparo el desayuno o algo por el estilo. Cargo la banda desde el puerto USB de mi laptop y no he visto nada malo en ello.3) Conexión/Sincronización/: La conexión de la banda es mediante bluetooth y funciona realmente bien, no tuve ningún problema al momento de sincronizarlo con mi Google pixel 4Xl, funciona de maravilla, al momento de reiniciar el móvil solo basta con dar doble click al botón de la pulsera y la misma se encarga de sincronizar y enlazar nuevamente con el celular.4) App: Aquí realmente hay puntos buenos y puntos MUY MALOS: El App está dividida en 4 secciones.Data: Aquí muestra todos los datos recopilados en el transcurso del día como son los pasos, ritmo cardiaco, los datos del sueño, el tono y el escaneo del cuerpo.Los datos de los pasos son bastantes confusos, yo practico Crossfit diario, y a veces hay rutinas de entrenamientos que incluyen correr 400 mts en cada ronda, por lo general 4, al terminar el entrenamiento del día , el app me indicó que hice 5,800 pasos lo cual es totalmente falso, también indicó que había quemado 1,250 calorías lo cual es totalmente falso, el Amazon Halo Band no sabe distinguir entre un Devil press, Burpees y correr, interpreta la mayoría de ejercicios de alta intensidad como correr/pasos, quizás esto se corrija en una actualización futura. Al investigar un poco más, pulsé el ejercicio que la app dijo que había hecho y ahí sí me aparecieron los datos correos, estos eran 2,100 pasos y 350 calorías. Hay una gran desorganización en la app.El ritmo cardiaco no tengo nada que objetar, tiene un medidor 24/7, ES BASTANTE PRECISO, 10/10 en este apartado.Sleep: Algo con lo que cumple realmente bien es como mide la calidad del sueño, ultimamente he tenido problemas para conciliar el sueño y puse a prueba Halo para ver si los datos que arroja son correctos, efectivamente los mide muy muy bien, te dice cuánto tiempo estuviste en fase REM, en fase profunda del sueño y sueño ligero, en base a los datos obtenidos te da una puntuación concerniente a la calidad del sueño.Tone: Esta es una de las funciones principales por la cual compre el Halo Band. Configurar el tono es bastante fácil, solo se necesita leer un párrafo que se muestra en pantalla y el mismo se adapta a tu tono de voz.La mayoría del tiempo Halo me ponía que estaba enojado, incluso cuando me estaba riendo con mis amigos y mi novia, no entiendo como amazon hace el análisis de voz.Si usted valora la batería de la pulsera, está función no es para usted, al activar la función tono, la batería por lo menos en mi caso no duró un solo día, tuve que ponerla a cargar al finalizar el día, tiene un consumo excesivo de batería, en mi caso, NO FUE NADA PRÁCTICO usar esta función, también tener en cuenta que si no sabe inglés esta función no le va a resultar pues únicamente está en el idioma inglés.Body: Esta es una de las mejores funciones que tiene el App, en mi caso fue bastante precisa. El app te pide que te quedes en ropa interior y te hace una serie de fotos para así calcular el body fat. Fue totalmente fidedigno con la medición hecha por mi médico, ¡bien amazon!Lab: Este es uno de los apartados que menos he utilizado, el motivo es que practico ejercicios de alta intensidad y tengo todas las rutinas grabadas en mi mente, además tengo un instructor físico para que haga ese trabajo. Para las personas que no vayan al gym o tengan algún instructor, esta opción les va de 10 porque hay infinidades de ejercicios, teniendo en cuenta que yo tomé la versión early access del producto, tengo 6 meses gratis de todos los beneficios de la banda, el que no los tenga, tendrá que pagar US$ 3.99 mensual. Este es un buen apartado.DATO RELEVANTE.Lo peor que puede tener este producto aunque no lo crean es que NO FUNCIONA SIN INTERNET, Si, el dispositivo no funciona. Esto es algo que de verdad me dejó totalmente sorprendido.Un día salgo de casa y en ese momento quise ver cuántos pasos había dado para comprarlo con mi apple watch, resulta que la banda decía syncing y luego envió otro mensaje que decía NO INTERNET CONNECTION, como diablos una banda de actividad física no va a poder medir NADA sin internet?Amazon, qué diablos estás haciendo con mi información? ¿Por qué necesito internet para ver los pasos que he dado? ¿Es necesario el internet para que la banda se sincronice con el teléfono?Esto es totalmente absurdo y hace que desconfíe de los productos de Amazon, tengo Varias Alexas Echo, Echo Show, Fire TV. Si quieren pueden probar ustedes mismos, apaguen los datos movil y el Wifi y verán el mensaje que digo .Conclusión:Creo que es una buena propuesta por parte de Amazon, soy fan de sus productos, es una buena iniciativa para el mundo fitness y bienestar de la salud, el producto está muy verde y se que con actualizaciones se pueden corregir la mayoría de problemas.Compraría el Amazon Halo Band con lo que se hace justo ahora? La respuesta es NO, no estoy dispuesto a pagar $99.99 por un producto que necesite de internet para sincronizar mis datos. Si eres como yo y los pudiste obtener con el Early access a US $64.99 entonces quizás si lo valga.",3
12,"I've been using the Amazon Halo fitness tracker for a couple of months now, coming from a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active. The Active was almost too feature-packed, and I wanted something that was more streamlined, simple, and refined.The Halo hits two of those points. It is streamlined and simple, but it is far from refined.One of the primary drawbacks from the Active was the short battery life. Having to take off your smartwatch and charge it every day or so makes it hard to get into the habit of actually wearing the darn thing. If you don't use the Tone feature (more on that in a moment), the Halo lasts a good 3-4 days per charge. That's fine, but with no display of any sort, no GPS, and a lack of other common sensors, it seems as though Amazon's engineers should have been able to get a week out of this thing, at least. The Fitbit Inspire 2 manages up to 10 days, and it features a touchscreen.I haven't had a chance to compare the Halo's step tracking against other trackers, but it seems to be relatively accurate, and also isn't as easily fooled by the ""wrist shake"" workout so many other trackers are susceptible to. The app keeps track of steps, but mostly bases your daily/weekly fitness score on the intensity of the workout, mostly based around peak heart rate. There were times, however, when a 15 minute elliptical session might score 30 points, and other times I only gained 15-20 points in a similar workout, so I have my doubts about how good of a job the tracking system is doing. It also doesn't automatically keep track of other workouts, such as lifting weights, yoga, etc. To score points for those, you have to manually add them by selecting from an activity list in the app and then inputting how much time you did said activity. That's all well and good, but there's certainly something to be said for smartwatches that allow you to select your workout activity and then start tracking it ahead of time, rather than trying to remember to keep track of how long you were doing something after the fact.The app also ""punishes"" you for inactivity, deducting one point from your score for every hour of laziness. That's fine, but here is where something resembling a ""notification"" function on the wearable would have come in handy. Anyone who's ever done a desk job, or sat down to binge watch a show knows how easy it is to lapse into forgetfulness and lose track of how much time you've been sitting still. Having some sort of haptic feedback in the Halo would allow it to buzz once or twice when you're getting close to losing points. That kind of interaction would make it easier to get into the good habit of doing a few jumping jacks or running in place for a bit when you're getting stagnate.I've not used other devices for sleep tracking before. The Active was too bulky, and the battery too short-lived for me to ever get used to wearing it at night. So I don't really have something with which to compare the Halo, but I'd say it was... hit-and-miss. I take a notoriously long time to fall asleep, yet the Halo routinely says I conked out in 5 minutes, even though I know I was tossing and turning for at least an hour before falling asleep. The light/deep/REM sleep tracking seemed to be relatively accurate, but the device doesn't track when you wake up unless it senses you've been awake for over five minutes, so... not great. I certainly wouldn't rely on this for any sort of highly accurate sleep study, but it seems to be decent for at least getting a sense of whether your sleep patterns are getting better or worse.The key feature of this device, Tone, uses the internal microphones to randomly listen to you talking at points throughout the day, and then provide feedback on the undertones of your comments. But there a two key reasons I don't use this: First, it cuts the battery life of the device by more than half, meaning you have to use the horrendous charging dock every other day (at least), rather than every 4-5 days. Second, it only tells you things like ""you sounded angry at 3:15pm,"" but doesn't allow you to go back in the app and listen to that moment in time so you can actually hear what you were saying. Was I actually angry? Who remembers precisely what they were saying at any moment of the day? It might be useful if you could actually turn it on for stretches of time in order to listen in while you're talking with your spouse or boss, so you can get a sense of whether your tone is conveying what you intended to say, but otherwise... this seems like more of an exercise in frustration and a gimmick that doesn't accomplish much. At least, not enough to offset the loss in battery life.The final major feature, body mapping, is all well and good, but it's literally something that can be accomplished solely in an app and doesn't require the fitness tracker at all. It's neat, and a good bit of information, but a trick any number of standalone fitness apps can accomplish.So where do I stand on Halo? A good first try, but not worth the $99 starting price, especially since a Fitbit Inspire 2 can often be had for $30 less, features longer battery life, and a better software experience on both the device and the phone. Tone is a fun gimmick, but something most people probably won't stick with, and body mapping isn't something you need the device to take advantage of. The next iteration should at least have a simple visual interface, even if it's just showing BPM or a clock face, a bit of haptic feedback, and longer battery life.Bear in mind, the Amazon Halo App requires a $3/mo subscription to use most of its features. While it comes with a lot of interesting integrations with various fitness companies, including specialized workout routines, etc., none of what's there so far can't be found other places. The sleep labs are basically just nightly soothing sounds or stories you can listen to. The integration goes as far as tracking whether those sounds help you get to sleep faster, but when you already know the device isn't accurately tracking how fast you're getting to sleep, there doesn't seem to be much utility to the function. There's no O2 sensor, no blood pressure tracking, no automatic workout tracking, and a curious lack of active encouragement. If you sat in one place all day, this device, and its attending app, would be fine with just slowly deducting points from your score and letting you go to waste. There's a balance there, because no one likes a busybody, but some active encouragement and better long-term trend tracking wouldn't go amiss.I'll likely keep using the device (since I'm past my return window anyway), and I'll be OK with it, but this could have been a lot more. To see Amazon reach for the stars while missing a lot of features that would have actually been useful is disappointing. Maybe they'll read this review and take it to heart. Probably not. But hopefully you do.",3
13,"I think the best way to get the most out of your halo is to simply stop thinking about it as a fitness tracker.  It is definitely NOT.  It is a health improvement service. It is going to be mostly beneficial for those looking to improve their overall health and NOT so much those who are already maintaining their health through a high level of fitness.2 yrs ago I did the noom weightloss app.  It was roughly 30 bucks a month and gave me the tools needed for me to take control of my weight and nutrition but it did not provide ANY fitness support at all.Now, after initial use of the HALO (just shy of 6 weeks) I am starting to view this as a health service without the nutrition.  And for 4 bucks a month I am ALL in.I lost 60lbs over the last 2 yrs through dietary changes alone and while I am happy with my current ""size"" I am not all that much HEALTHIER than I was 60 lbs ago. I have improved things like knee pain, carpal tunnel and sleep apnea from the weight loss...but I have crappy endurance and still an unhealthy amount of body fat and not nearly enough muscle tone...so HALO feels like my next step to getting my overall health improved.The band is NOT the product.  The app and labs are the product, the band provides your progress tracking and data on the biggest areas to impact overall health: Body fat decrease, sleep quality increase, daily activity vs sedentary time within a healthy range etc.The more goals you meet, the higher the goals get...first week my goal was 150 points.  I hit it but barely at 159.  Now this week is 1500 points, so I am utilizing the labs to get those activity points AND to keep myself from getting sucked into a book or t.v. and LOSING those hard earned points (nooo!😂)! The tracker does what it is designed to do...keep me on track.I am LOVING it.The ONLY thing I can't seem to get working is tone. It simply does not accept my voice test to get started.  I have no clue why.  I saw there was another update so I am going to try to reboot, and update tomorrow to see if I can get that last peice of the puzzle going.  If not, HALO support has offered to help, and they have been wonderful so far!I plan to use tone to track trends like what time of day do I sound most stressed or angry vs when I sound happiest...assume these are accurate to my mindset and plan accordingly. Maybe a strong cardio slotted into that angry/stressed time will help me improve my mood or fuel the workout intensity a bit more? I also just started a new job and I am looking for TONE to help ensure perception of my voice is positve since I work totally remote and rely on a lot of calls where I don't havr the benefit of body language cues to relay my intended emotion...and suspect some of the things I am saying are being taken as overly aggreseive, so I want to see if this is perception of my team or if I need to really adjust my way of talking. I think if people dedicate themselves to following the suggested labs they will see improvement and if we get all areas improved, we should have better overall health.Along with improved sleep, increased muscle, decreased fat, there is also the possibility of healthier relationship as we become more aware of how we sound and adjust our tone...healthier relationships from work to family to partners to kids can improve our own mindsets and possibly improve our mental health...yes PLEASE!😍😍I am not aware of ANY other service like this. There are plenty of fitness trackers...but for the millions that are out there, there has not been a correlating improvement in overall health of the millions that are using them.  Clearly it is time to try something different...THIS feels like something different.  I am all in.At the very least, I am curious to see what my results will be at the end of the 6 month free trial.That time period is not an accident.  No doubt Amazon has studied the hell out of this and expect those who follow the program as designed will see a measurable improvement.For 4 bucks a month and a bit of effort and dedication on my part, this seems like EXACTLY the right product for me.But I can clearly see how those who bought it as a fitness tracker will be greatly disappointed, and those who don't utilize the labs will not see the benefit of the monthly cost.Reading some if these reviews, Amazon needs to do a better job of conveying EXACTLY what HALO IS.  Something is getting lost in translation because this is pretty revolutionary for what it CAN do.  They need to do a better job of marketing this so people have accurate expectations and understand what they are getting and NOT getting.  This is NOT a fitbit type thing.  This IS a program.  This is NOT going to remind you to move.  YOU are expected to already WANT to do that.  This is NOT going to give you texts and email alerts (there is no screen or vibration on the band) because this is a program that actually is supporting a LESS plugged in way of life.  By NOT having anything on the band, you def forget you are wearing it at ALL.  Which makes it easy to just work a twice daily check in on your app into your day.  I check in the a.m. to see my sleep score, then in the evening to check my overall activity and then if I need to up my scores. i knock out a lab or two and move on with my day.  Then I download my weekly health data, which they provide via excel, and VOILA! i have measurable data to help me track my progress and plan for more improvement. I love love love it! Now, to work on getting TONE to work....",4
14,"I am very happy with this band. I used to use a fitbit band, but eventually just used it for sleep. My main uses of this band are: sleep, activity points, and tone. I do love the body scanner. I use it about once a month. I like that the body scanner shows your actual body fat percentage. I am not terribly overweight (at the top of the normal weight range for my height) but my body fat percentage was 36%! I would not have known this if this band didn't have a scanner. I would have assumed I am at a decent weight since I am in the normal weight range for my height. This has motivated me to do more cardio than I would have otherwise.I really like the tone analyzing function. I have two young children and appreciate knowing when my tone is coming across too harsh. I do like that it even differentiates between two types of harsh tones. For example, there were instances when I had angry tones and one was distinguished as irritated while another was condescending. That is a big difference and I appreciate it noting these so I can evaluate the situation that I had the condescending tone in and see what I can improve on for the next similar situation. The same is for the sad category of tones. Some can be actually depressed while others may be hesitant.The sleep function is by far my favorite. I wear my band every night and review my sleep each morning. The sleep function breaks down sleep by REM, light sleep, and deep sleep. It shows when you were awake during the night and calculates a sleep score for the night's sleep. One thing I like about the sleep portion of this band is the insight section. I can have a whole week of reviewing my sleep and make slight adjustments to improve quality of sleep and my mood when I wake up, but the insight section showed me that one whole week I averaged less total time of asleep as well as more disturbances from the next week and asked me to evaluate what was different in my routine between the two weeks. As a woman, this has also been helpful in identifying trends that are connected with the week in my mestrual cycle. For instance, that week I did not sleep as much and had more disturbances was the week before my period. So now I know I can take some sleep vitamins before that week starts to try to help prevent those disturbances and get more sleep.The activity points is difference from other bands that just count steps and I am so happy for it! I could pretty easily not exert much energy and get to 10,000 steps on a fitbit band. On the halo, though, it takes actual exertion to get those 150 points. And you lose points for being sedentary for too long! Talk about giving me motivation to actually exercise.. This band tracks activity levels for intense, moderate, light, and sedentary activity. I like this because even if I reach 150 points (which I am working towards-I'm not there yet), I can look back at daily and weekly averages of which types of activity had the most points so I could still improve more if I wanted to have more points in moderate vs light activity.The app also has a recorded section of how many calories your body daily and weekly averages based on your heartbeat in addition to keeping all your averages for daily and weekly goals.I have not used a ton of the labs that are available through the app, but I have looked through them and have tried a couple. I like that most of them are small steps to help create routines and habits. I feel like this band actually wants us to improve our lives, not just complete a super intense workout and be done. The workouts available on the app are good too. I do wish there was a filter for using no equipment to make my search for workouts faster, but that is super minor and it still doesn't take me long to find a workout I want to do. I like that the difficulty levels range in the workouts as well as the length of the workout. Basically, this band is made for everyone whether you are just starting out with getting healthy/tracking habits, occasionally working out, or whether you are a super fit person.The battery life is good. I can easily last a week with the tone turned off and lasts about two and a half days with tone on during the day and turned off at night when I'm asleep. I love that I can plug the band in the morning and have it back on before I start any activity with no waiting.As far as how the band looks, I have the black band. I like the look of it and the comfort of wearing it. The light that flashed under the band can be seen a little bit at night but it doesn't wake me up. I like that the band cannot come unthreaded from the loop. This makes it much easier and quicker to put on. I also like that it's velcro instead of snaps, buttons, or the like. This allows me to adjust to exactly where I need it which is super helpful since I have skinny wrists. I also like that it's worn below the wrist bone instead of above it. This has kept the band from pinching or pressing into my skin when typing on a computer, writing, or have my wrist in a fixed, bent position for awhile- which I had issues with the fitbit band.Overall, I am extremely happy with this band and am excited to order another for my husband who has been jealous since I got one before it was publicly available.",5
15,"I love all (but one) the features of this band. Since I read most of the first hundred reviews of this before buying, a lot of my review addresses the same topics because I feel people just didn’t read before they bought it?Tone: The tone measuring is interesting and seems very accurate, but after a month of wearing it, I limited the hours to when I’m at work only to save the battery, sure, but mostly because I don’t speak much at home. It’s really fun to play with, and it has both a live view where you can watch your tone in real time as well as tracks notable moments. If you want it to pay attention to a particular interaction, you can slyly tap the button like a super tone spy and look back at it later.The Halo membership:The programs and reminders that are part of the halo membership are pretty good. It has everything you could want to try from 2 minute workouts to long runs to intermittent fasting to avoiding processed foods goals.The activity points you earn each week seem well founded, and I enjoy trying to get steps in and remembering to move around. I see the top review here is pretty angry about how the points work, so I was a little worried, but after my trial period so far, I really appreciate how it’s done.Temperature Tracking WHAT I AM SUPER DISSATISFIED WITH:The only thing I am disappointed in that would be an easy fix I think is the sleep temperature. As a woman trying to conceive, one way to track ovulation and when your period is coming is basal body temperature. It requires that you take your temperature when you first first first wake up without moving or drinking or talking or thinking much. You’ve got to grab it at its lowest. I got the watch over others because it claims to track your sleep temperature. Awesome! However, it establishes the “average” temperature of your sleep over three days and then only shows you how you vary off that baseline each night after. Just give me the temperature! Or tell me my average. Women’s temperatures vary A LOT based on where they are in their cycle, and so if I had started wearing my watch at a different time in my cycle, it would look way different! Just tell me my temperature! You obviously have it if you’re able to tell me that last night I was .4 degrees Fahrenheit off my “baseline” so just display the temperature, not silly bar graphs. I can’t use that data if I don’t know what you think my baseline is.If it could just let me see the actual temperature reading, I’d give it 5 stars for sure. I was really disappointed in that part, but if you’re not tracking your BBT, then it’s pretty good.Other sleep stuff:I’m a good sleeper already, so I don’t pay a ton of attention to the sleep aid stuff they have, but my husband uses it when he can’t fall asleep even though he doesn’t wear the band! Seeing the sleep stats each morning is pretty interesting to me though, and I look them over when I eat breakfast.No face: I don’t like smart watches, and I don’t want a watch face.Comfort:Other negative things I’ve seen claim it’s bulky and has to be worn super tight or it clanks around. Absolutely not true. I have tiiiiiiny wrists and I never even notice it. It’s covert; everyone thinks it’s just a bracelet.Battery:It charges incredibly fast. I charge it every 3-5 days depending on if I use the tone feature more or less. The clip is really easy to use, and to be frank, I’ve seen a few reviews that whine about how hard it is to get on the charger, and those people must be doofs. I don’t even look when I put it on the charger because it’s so simple.Body scan stuff:I was hesitant about the body scan…like, I already have a 3D model right here. It’s me. But somehow, seeing it on a screen and being able to slide the scale to more or less muscle/fat ratios is really interesting, and for me, motivating. It seems to have helped me overcome the mirror warp of looking at myself my whole life. Seeing the model on the screen, I was like, woah….that’s what I look like!?Alexa link:I wish it connected to more things like some reviews say. Peloton, if I used one, for example, would be a fair ask I think. I thought that because our household uses Alexa devices that I would like asking her about my stats, but I don’t really do that much just because I usually review my stats each evening or at a glance on my phone whenever I want anyway. If Alexa wanted to read out my reminders to the programs I chose in the Halo membership app, that could be cool.Other:I swim and shower with it, and I cannot believe how fast the band dries. Like 10-20 minutes and the only clue I was in the shower is my wet hair.It does have a cute ass name, be honest.Drawbacks:There’s a blinking green light I can see sometimes at night. It doesn’t bother me at all, but I could see someone whining about it. The sensor against your wrist lights up green. If you move just right in the dark, you can see it. I cannot see it through my eyelids, only if I’m looking at it directly.There aren’t enough cute bands to buy to switch out yet. I got the cutest one I could find, and I actually love it. I do hope they come out with more though because I’m looking to have it match outfits better someday. I like the pink one it came with, but after a month, it has dirtied a bit in places where it touches most. I’ve heard you can clean it really easily, but haven’t tried it. It’s not that noticeable really. My husband says he can’t tell what I’m talking about. It pops in and out super easily, and since it’s worn against your wrist, it always feels very secure.Every time I get grumpy or go on a rant, my husband says he’s going to ask Jeff Bezos what my tone is.",3
16,"I was *really* happy with this until late on day 2. Long story short, the deal-breaker for me is that you have to wear it semi-tightly and in a specific spot for it to function, which gets incredibly uncomfortable (and even painful) for me after a day or so of continuous wear. I was pretty surprised by this since I don't have sensory issues and am fine with tight bracelets and such, although, full disclosure, I wear my watches very loosely. If you don't have any issues wearing a watch with a good grip around your wrist, this could be fine for you but it turned out to be much too uncomfortable for me for some reason (probably the small footprint of the device digging into the same spot on my arm for hours).I tried several solutions but sadly couldn't make it work. I found myself yanking it off quite a bit out of frustration, which defeats the purpose. I'm disappointed because it was very promising in every other way (in the time I had it) and I feel like I would have really gotten good use out of it overall.I only had it for about a week and there are better reviews on here about the actual functionality of the device/app, so I'm only including a short review on those bits. The specifics of my comfort/pain issues are at the bottom in case they help someone decide.--------------------------------Device/AppPros:- It looks great (I got Winter + Silver)- It's very small and sleek, and very light, but doesn't feel cheap. The band felt pretty high quality. Looking at it online, I was afraid it would start to pill rather quickly but after having it in person, I don't think it would. (But again, the caveat is that I only had it a week.)- Not having to take it off in the shower/pool is the greatest. You really can just forget it's on until the app tells you it needs a charge. (Another review said the fabric band stays wet too long for their liking and I can see that being the case. I didn't mind it, though. To me it just felt slightly damp for 15 minutes until I forgot about it.)- The app interface is very nice and the app is easy to use- Sleep tracking was very interesting and very detailed, and was helping me be more mindful of my sleeping habits/patterns. This was by far the best part for me in my limited use.Neutral:- I tried a few of the labs and they seem like they would be great but given that I only had it a week, I can't comment on whether they were actually useful or just fluff- I didn't get to try the body scanner or voice tone features (once I started having issues and realized I might be returning it, I held off on setting any of that up since it's more involved)Cons:- It seems like the labs are only able to send out one reminder a day? Which isn't really helpful for some of them. For example, I was doing ""drink a glass of water before every meal"" lab but only being able to set a single reminder for noon doesn't help with dinner. Some labs need to be able to set multiple reminders and I couldn't find a way to do that.- The app has a lot of ""did you know"" and ""try this lab"" stuff on the landing screen, which got kind of annoying after I'd done my own initial looking around. I just wanted the major data points on that screen that I could focus on and the rest of it to go away. Maybe they would have slowly fallen off after using it for a longer period?- I didn't need to use the button on the device at all until I tried to factory reset it to return it, and when I did, the button got ""stuck"" a bit after pressing it. Not badly. I just had to lightly jiggle it with my thumb very briefly for it to pop back out. But that made me wonder how sturdy that button is and how long it would last. Could have just been a fluke.- And, of course, the aforementioned comfort/pain issues--------------------------------Discomfort/Pain Info & Attempted Solutions- The instructions say to wear it about two fingers-width above your wrist, just past the wrist bone. And tight enough so that two fingers fit underneath the band, between your skin and the band. I followed these instructions.- The first day was fine, including sleep. I hardly noticed it was on. I wore it from early afternoon through to the next day at dinner time with no issues.- That second day around dinner time, it started to to hurt and I noticed it was leaving a divot in my skin where the device sat on top of my wrist. After a couple days of trying to work out solutions, it ended up that I would have to take it off for several hours before wearing it was comfortable again. After that, I could only wear it for 6-8 hours at a time before I'd have to take it off again.- I tend to sleep on my arm and, depending on how long I've worn the device before I go to bed, it would painfully dig into my arm while trying to fall asleep. Again, it wasn't a problem the first night but became part of the cycle of on/off after that.- I tried loosening it enough so that I could wear it for longer periods but that meant it wasn't tight enough to get good readings.- I also tried swapping wrists when one began to hurt but, even though I'm slightly ambidextrous, this didn't solve the issue for a few reasons. Mainly, I'd have to swap it around again depending on which hand I was using for a given activity. Plus, it also just seemed to defeat the purpose of being able to wear it and forget it.- To be clear, it's not the band that's the issue. The fabric band I got was quite comfortable and didn't irritate at all. It's the device, and likely its small ""footprint"" on your arm, which stays in the same spot and starts to dig into your skin, leaving it raw as well as just being painful pressure after a while.None of the mentioned solutions worked. It was either still uncomfortable regardless or just required a lot of fiddling that defeated the purpose of the device for me, which was that I could wear it all the time and never have to worry about it unless it needed to be charged. So I had to begrudgingly return it. :(",3
17,"I got two of these, one for me and one for our wife, so we could start a fitness journey together.  It is cheap enough where we could get the pair.  I wasn't early access, so I paid full price. Also, the website said ""Usually ships in 4-6 weeks."" No idea where that came from.  Mine arrived in *2 days* with free shipping (of course).We have both been losing about 1% body fat each and every week, and we're fit people.  But this thing pushes you to the next level. The scanner is *extremely accurate* and very consistent.  I find it motivating, and I love the slider that lets you see what just one more percent will bring.  Other online reviews say ""Oh, you don't need a band for that. You can get a phone to scan for body fat."" If that's true, I haven't seen it (I've got a Pixel, so maybe its an iPhone app? I don't know).  I've looked, and very much doubt it could be this on point.  I do what it wants - every day, same lighting, same clothes, minimal clothes, etc.  Also, everyone says ""Take pictures to track your progress; using the scale is misleading"" and this does it for you.  Great advice and this thing records everything automatically and you can just see you results in the app.Also, I *love* the tonal feature.  It's fun, and its accurate.  It can tell when I sound low energy, disgusted, or skeptical, plus its a fun thing to mess with my wife about.  I mean, she might be telling me why she doesn't want to watch Terminator 2, I can tap my Amazon Halo (reminding her she is wearing hers) and say ""What would Halo think? Maybe you're being unsupportive or skeptical."" My point is its very fun.Also, sleep analysis seems very accurate too.  It seems to just know when I'm up and when I'm sleeping.  Maybe if you work at nights it would get confused, but that isn't my situation and it seems pretty accurate to me.The labs and classes I don't care about.  YouTube has a thousand self-help and workout videos so take your pick.  They can drop those, or if others like them, more power to them.  To each their own.I guess my point is that this is a fantastic device.  I was in the market for a new fitness band (or smartwatch, or whoop, or Oura ring) for myself, and found this that did everything I wanted to do (and more, really unique, bleeding edge features), and it was so cheap and had everything I wanted, I was able to buy two.  I really, truly recommend buying two if you have a partner to share it with.  It has been a huge amount of fun, conversations, friendly competition, and more.  Couldn't be more excited to see what comes out next.ADVICE TO AMAZON:Just to put it out there: I think it is cheap enough to make it worth it, even with the monthly fee. However, I do not like that pricing model.  You pay for your equipment, and you not be locked out of what it can do ever. That is wrong and Amazon should stop.  It is worth it, but I'm strongly opposed to this business model and would very strongly encourage Amazon to abandon it.  It really puts people off, its short sighted, is my only real objection to the wonderful device, and I think it really explains why this device only has 50,000 downloads in the app store (at the time of this writing).  Honestly, it should have 1,000,000 (FitBit has 10,0000,000).Also, why are they not advertising it? I think it can take if Amazon pushes it a little more, and stops scaring people off with a *forever* fee.  That would open up way more doors and differentiate itself from FitBit and Whoop.Such a bad idea.  If this product fails, and I hope it doesn't, that is the reason. Whoever committed to that idea is killing this product.  I really hope it takes off *despite* that bad, bad decision.PROS:EXCELLENT price - BUY TWO if you have a partner to do it with you; you won't regret it. WAY more fun that you both buying your own separate but different devices.SLEEP: Accurate, and score helps motivatePULSE: Accurate, and helps show how intense you need to be.TONE: Just really fun.BODY FAT SCAN:  Extremely accurate, very consistent; the slider is VERY motivating.CONS:MONTHLY FEE ($4/mo) after 6 months - This is a tremendous mistake on Amazon's part.  If this kills the product, this is why.  They need to drop this immediately. It feels wrong to have a company turn off part of your product after you buy it.LABS - You can get this stuff for free on YouTube and million other places.  Not a negative, but just a nonfeature for me. If you like it, no problem, enjoy it. Hey, if you want a $4/month fee, don't shut down the phone; just put these new labs behind the pay wall? I won't miss them, and maybe Amazon can justify it because you are getting something ""new"" for the fee (new Labs), but they aren't disabling part of the device.Either way, I hope you try it, and try it with someone if you can.  I want to see what happens with this product - I can't wait to see the next feature drop and what the Halo Team comes up with next!",5
18,"So I've had the Alexa Halo for about 2 or so months now. I use wear it everyday and it is a decent decive as a start but it definitely needs to be improved.Pros:1. It's not distracting. There is not screen so its simple and doesn't draw your attention. You really kind of forget you're wearing it.2. It has some good features. It can read your heart rate, track your sleep, tracks steps, etc.3. It charges quickly and stays charged for a long time. Since there is no screen draining the battery, a single charge can last a few days.4. The app is informative and has a lot of interesting videos and information to help you meet your exercise goals.5. The device itself is nice because its waterproof, easy to clean, and had a bunch of different wrist band attachments to help with different exercises.6. The way it tracks progress is pretty cool. It goes buy the amount of effort you put into your work out as opposed to basic data like just how many steps you took or just how long you did something. This is nice because it really shows a more complete view of what you've pushed yourself to do as opposed to just what you have done.Cons/Possible Improvements:1. It is a little to simple. I like that its not distracting, but if I'm going to wear something on my wrist, it would be nice if it did something useful like tell time or display some form of information. This doesn't have to be super intrusive or in-depth like a screen that shows text and apps and such. But a little of something would be nice. A clock especially would be useful. Especially considering I can use this device without my phone being there.2. The features a kind of lackluster. Yes, it records steps (sometimes), yes it can record your heartbeat, sometimes it can auto-detect exercises (sometimes and not very accurately), and yes it tracks your sleep (also not super accurately and essentially it would tell me anything, I'm not a sleepologist, the data it shows means little to me) but otherwise its not super innovative or special in that regard. YES I know it can listen to your tone and tell you information about your tone, yes I know it can with pictures give you a body scan type thing. But honestly in the times I've had this device, I've never used those features once. I probably should. But the tone feature is a drain on the battery, and the body scan feature seems a little intrusive to me so I just haven't bothered. I got this as a gift for a friend of mine who is also working out with me and he too hasn't used those features either. Maybe they are good? But overall its just not impressive or innovative compared to other fitness trackers.3. The app is pretty much crap. It has some good features but its set-up is not so great and it does so little it and the device seem a little useless. It doesn't connect to other apps for tracking data for more accurate data which it should. Myfitnesspal, Google Fit, Samsung Health, Fitbit, whatever. These apps should be able to sync with the app to provide a greater user experience and to give more data on exercises and such to help with working out and weight-loss journeys. The app would greatly benefit from something that can track caloric intake or just food in general for nutritional purposes like what MyFitnessPal does. Additional features within the app would greatly improve user experience. As would a redesign of the apps interface. It is confusing and there is a lot of information thrown at you with little explanation. It's not exactly the easiest to navigate when looking for stuff and the information provided is very basic. On that note, the information you can provide to it is lacking. For instance the list of exercises you can put into the app to add to your daily workouts is really lackluster. You can't put custom exercises or include multiple ones in a single work out. And since the auto-detecting feature for exercises isn't very accurate. It just lumps the time you exercised all together but doesn't take into account what you specifically did or how those things could have affected your caloric burn. For instance. If I did 20 minutes of cardio and then went to do weights for 10 and then machines for 30 minutes, it will register and hour of exercise. But will only measure my heart rate for that hour and will only take into account my cardio and maybe my moderate or intense moments of the other part of the work out. It also will only register certain workouts as long as I'm moving. But if I were say using a stationary bike, it can't detect that. Or if I'm on the treadmill but holding the side bars or the front bar to get heartrate, it doesn't register steps because the accelerator isn't sensitive enough. Which is why using apps like MyRunKeeper or Google Fit and syncing them with this app would be helpful.4. As mentioned about it is not super accurate. I don't expect it to be 100% accurate but I'd like it to be more accurate than it is. Comparing its data to other apps data it just doesn't really measure up. Specifically when doing cardio like walking or running the step count is usually horrible wrong. And for exercises like swimming it bike riding it normally can't accurately assess what's happening to give good data in that exercise.5. I like how it shows the effort you've put into your workouts. I don't like that it subtracts points for being stationary. Yes, I get we should be active throughout the day, but some people just aren't able to for whatever reason. They have stationary jobs, they just physically can't be active, whatever. This shouldn't negatively effect their activity scores. A better solution might just be to send a reminder or notification to be more active. Something that can be turned on or off, but can remind you that maybe you should get up and walk around a bit or whatever.6. On that note of reminders. Since this is mostly app based, other notification reminders would be nice. Like drink some water, don't forget to record your current weight/check in, record your food for today (if that feature was added) even little messages of encouragement like other apps do would be appreciated. Like: you did 30 minutes of exercise! Or Good job! That was a great work out, 25 minutes of intense working out and 30 of moderate intensity! Way to go! Or you've walked about 4 miles today or 8,943 steps! Keep it up! Little things that will remind us we are doing a good job while also keeping us informed about what's happening so we don't have to constantly check the app.Overall, its a decent device for a start. I hope in the next version they add some new better features and in the mean time hopefully they really work on the app and the features it has within. Some basic changes and some additions that other fitness apps currently have and this app/device could be really amazing! I would recommend it, but don't expect anything super amazing.In a few months I'll try and do an update to this review to see if they've improved the app anymore since then. And maybe by then I'll have used the two main features as well.",2
19,"I got my Halo a few weeks ago and have worn it since.  I'm a 62 yo grandmom, a full-time caretaker, no youngster and no time to 'exercise' regularly & at this point don't want to!  But I do want to be healthy, lose some weight and get in somewhat better shape.  I have had a Garmin, pedometer, and have had an Apple Watch (AW) since they came out.  I gave up on the Garmin & pedometer, they didn't seem accurate to me.  I love my AW and the fitness info it gives me but wanted some more in-depth info. The Halo delivers.  I don't intend to push my weekly activity past the 150 start point and the labs are not designed for someone like me, they are way too intense!  I walk my dogs a few times a week, weather permitting.  I wear my AW on my left wrist and the Halo on my right.  The Halo is not big, does not irritate my skin nor get in the way with normal activities.  I use the app Lose It! to track my food and some other stuff.  Really like that app!Activity - I like the 150/week starting point that it has, haven't met it yet, but I am finding that I'm more active than I was.  Also use my AW to tell me daily how my 'move' has increased or decreased, so the Halo fits right into that and gives me my daily steps.  I'm fine with that.  It does not track when I walk on our treadmill - even if I 'swing' my arms to simulate walking, or if I ride our stationary bike - there really should be an easier way to track those but now you have to drill down into 'activity' and add it.  Would rather there was somewhere I could say, I'm going for a walk on the treadmill and have it track it for me instead of trying to remember when I started & finished for the time count which adds to my weekly activity numbers!Sleep is pretty interesting, Halo has more information on my sleep, but isn't always accurate as far as I can tell, I sleep well almost every night, but it tells me that there have been some not so good sleeping nights. Not sure how it determines that as I feel good when I get up and throughout the day.  It has a better diagram than my AW, but neither seem to be great at telling me how I do.  And its kind of hard to read, and says that if you're up for 5 minutes that counts as a disturbance, but from what I've seen that isn't accurateTone - initially I just read off the text they give you for tone to figure out who I was, but most of my days were said to be pretty yucky so I reset my Halo and started again, this time reading just as if I was reading a story to a grandkid or myself... with emotion!  Guess what?  That helped So Much!  AW doesn't offer tone on its watches, but if you do decide to use tone, be aware you'll need to charge your band every single day!  Your choice to use or not... but it is pretty nifty!Body - took my initial body scan knowing my BMI was high, retook it 2 weeks later as suggested and it didn't change - except I have lost weight. Not much, but I'm still working on it.  I feel like the scan was pretty accurate but when I reset Halo for tone I didn't feel like it was something I wanted to pursue, which I initially thought I would.  Maybe I'll try that again in a few weeks.I haven't had any issues with syncing to the app on my phone. I did originally have some issues with just getting it set up - do NOT use the bluetooth function on your phone to try & pair the band - won't work and then won't let you pair it, you'll have to start over with resetting the band and removing the Bluetooth connection. Just go through the app, you'll be fine!I have a *smart* scale that tells me my weight, body fat and a bunch of other info that I enjoy using much more than the Halo, but thats just me.I like that Halo does not have a face on it - I already have a watch I love... tell me the time, lets me pay for stuff and keeps track of my activities and Halo adds to that function.  It has a low profile, the band can be changed (the pink fabric one gets pretty dirty pretty fast!) and so far I'm happy with it.Keep in mind!  This is NEW!  But Amazon has shown that it stands behind its products, and is always making them better - just ask Alexa!  haha  I have no doubt that as time goes on Amazon will continue to improve Halo and make it an even better value - especially if you're younger and more active and want to do the labs to get you moving... I'll stick to my walks and my treadmill (which it doesn't recognize, ugh!, but I can set my AW for a walk and get credit!). So give it a try - or wait until we've all figured out the good, bad and the ugly and you can come in on version 2!  Good luck!",4
20,"I tried to hold off writing a review until my free 6 month Halo membership expired because I wanted to see how useful the band was without a monthly membership fee, but I can't wait because of another Bluetooth episode today. Perhaps I'll revise this review then.  I wanted a simple health monitor for my wife and I. So I bought two. The setup for the associated app, without which all you have is a useless wristband, was clumsy beginning with the Bluetooth link to my android phone. Incidentally, the Halo App does not work on  my new Amazon tablet, nor is it in the list of apps available in the Amazon Appstore. Apparently, it is android, Iphone, or highway. I had to enter data, re-enter data, press buttons, but I finally got the clumsy setup to work.  There is not much in the way of help information as to how to navigate the menus to extract data. Fortunately, all we wanted was heart rate, steps, and sleep information. (I was disappointed that here was no distance or GPS but this was a very inexpensive product.) So after a few weeks, we got used to the operation and obtained the data we wanted . My wife was pleased that the information could be directly linked with here WW account. So that was a plus.  Then the Bluetooth problems began. Halo does not allow you to connect with Bluetooth in the usual way. You have to connect through the Halo app, and that requires that you step through their programmed sequence. If you lose Bluetooth, you can only reconnect through the app.  And that's where a problem lies. To reconnect, basically you must go to Bluetooth and forget the connection. Then you have to start all over with the app and re-enter all your data including your Amazon password. ALL your data is lost during the reconnect. We've had the Halo bands for 4 months, and I've had to do this restart at least five times on my band and several times on my wife's. Reconnect Bluetooth should not require such drastic action or data loss.  Why was I waiting for 6 months to write a review? I wanted to see how easy the band would be to use for the items I wanted: Heart rate, steps, and sleep because most of the advertised functions disappear with the monthly membership. I can't think of any price higher than $0/month that would induce me to remain a member. I like the idea of a simple-to-use health wrist band (we don't usually wear watches), but at this point I would rather spend more money for something that works better and has GPS, but I do not want to sign up for extra-cost monthly memberships that spends much of the time trying to sell me junk or detecting my mood by the sound of my voice (really stupid, particularly since dealing with the band often leaves me in a bad mood). Even with the ""Tone"" disabled, I have yet to get more than three days on a charge despite the claim of up to seven.  I use a lot of Amazon products (yes, including two of the infamous Amazon phones which I liked pretty well despite the flaws of its customized OS), but I don't believe this Halo lame horse will earn a permanent place in my stable.Okay I've lowered the rating to 1 star because there is no lower rating available. Yesterday, I lost Bluetooth again. I put the device on the charger and went through all the reconnection nonsense of re-entering all my personal data, and logging in to Amazon and having to do the OTP again twice, once for Amazon, once for Halo. Tried again this morning, but now the device will not connect despite multiple tries, and so I own a useless bracelet and never reached the 6 month mark to find out whether it provides enough information to be useful without a membership. All that remains now is to test the one-year warranty that the device came with.  My current resolution is to never buy another fitness tracker that requires a monthly membership fee or a bluetooth connection to get useful information. My recommendation: DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE.I talked with Amazon Support. After a brief consultation in which they couldn't get the bluetooth to connect, they sent me a new Halo. When I received it, I started up the connection process. The app connected almost immediately. Aha, I thought, this is more like it. After connecting, the app then announced it would update the software on the Halo. After about five minutes, it gave up and and said the connection failed. I then had to go through all the steps to reconnect to the Halo band. It failed repeatedly. Finally, I got it to connect but I'm not sure which of the many tries found the magic combination. Since then it mostly works although the blue tooth often fails to connect. So far the reconnection have taken place after several tries with turning off bluetooth, turning on blue tooth, stopping the Halo app, and pushing the Halo button twice. I do not know the magic combination, but at least I haven't had to start completely over and re-enter all my data onto the Halo app.They've added a new feature to the app, LIVE with categories such as walking, weight lifting, etc. Unfortunately, you must have your phone with you for this feature to work. Apparently, the Halo is unable to store enough data to track this on its own. For my usage, that doesn't work. I am not going to tote a phone around in the gym with I work out. It's OK for walking I suppose, but I can get a free app to track my walking on my phone, all the Halo adds to that is my heart rate information.Amazon support was great, but I remain unimpressed with the capabilities of the Halo band. I will check out their new watch version, to see what info it gives without a membership, but I fear they are more interested in forcing a membership on you for a steady revenue flow. I have no interest in a membership. I repeat, I want to track my sleep, track my walking with distance (& heart rate without my phone), and perhaps track other workouts without having to rely on a membership. I do not want to examine the Tone of my voice. I don't mind using the body fat feature except that it is connected to a membership. In general, I am not satisfied. NOT RECOMMENDED.OKAY. They sent a replacement, and I've had it for about a month. Yesterday, the Bluetooth disconnected. Coincidentally(?) So did the Bluetooth on my wife's Halo band. According to my phone, the Bluetooth was still connected to the phone, but the Halo app said no, and the Halo app insists on controlling the Bluetooth connection. I had to start from scratch by first disconnecting the phone's Bluetooth connection. AGAIN. That meant going through a complete setup. That didn't work. Neither did restarting the phone or restarting the app. After reinstalling the app, I started from scratch again with password entry and OTP for times and several factory resets because the purple flashing light did not want to come on. I then reinstalled the app. Problem persisted following instructions until I took band out of charger and did a factory reset until I got blinking purple, then replaced in charger. Finally connected.THIS BAND IS NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE EXPECIALLY BECAUSE ALL DATA MUST PASS THROUGH A WONKY APP. DO NOT BUY is now my recommendation down from not recommended.",1
21,"I'm reviewing this as a basic fitness tracker on par with entry level Fitbits, Garmins and similar devices.  This is not a high level or even medium level exercise and training tool.  If you are looking for higher level tracking and analysis of overall health, recovery and exertion during a training session, this is not the device.As a basic movement and sleep tracker I found it operates on par with similar devices.  I'm comparing it to stuff I own like the Oura Ring, Whoop Band and Garmin 945.  All operated close or equal to those other devices in terms of accuracy when we are talking about basic data like steps, sleep and heart rate.  I will say that during an exercise session, the optical heart rate sensor of the Halo seems to prove more accurate than the optical sensor on my Whoop and the optical sensor on my Garmin.  But remember, optical sensors are limited.  They tend not to be responsive to quick changes in HR.  So if you are doing a lot of HIITs style training, you are not going to get those extreme HR peaks.I also like the form factor.  It's thin, does not have that high of a profile (similar to that of a high end fitness watch) and the band is secure.  One note on this.  Many have reported that band to be too inflexible.  It is more inflexible that other fabric bands I have used, but I found that to be a good thing.  When sweaty or in the water fabric bands tend to loosen up and provide inaccurate optical HR readings.  This one did not do that and it appeared to give good HR readings even when underwater.So, I found it to be a good overall, basis, fitness tracker, but limited in the data it provides so not so good as an exercise/recovery tracker.  Here are a few things I found it lacked.  It does not do a good job at recognizing the beginning and ending of a training session.  It is also unable to recognize the type of training (walk, run, bike, swim, elliptical, etc.).  Recovery-wise it does not calculate HRV, which is the new gold standard in recovery readings for devices such as these.  And while it does give you resting heart rate, it is hard to find and not right in the open.  This is strange as it is a basic recovery metric almost everybody wants to know.Now, let's talk about the two things it does that are unique to it, including the thing that brought the elephant into the room:  Body and Tone.Body is the ability of the app (which you have to have a band and membership to fully operate) to take pictures of you front ankles to head from front, both side and your back.  The apps is nifty and audibly talks you through the process.  With the right lighting, it was able to give a very detailed, 3D model of my body that looks like early version of a CGI person from movie making.  It was so accurate when used outside in sunlight, that it picked up a subtle divot in my right quad from a car-bicycle accident a few years ago.  But how accurate is the body fat percent readings.  If you believe the study that has been often cited in the media, it's as accurate as a DexaScan (remember, Amazon funded that one study which had a small sample size).  So, I recently had a DexaScan.  I also have been trained and have a bunch of experience in using calipers to measure lean body mass.  Body seems to over calculate your total body fat percentage.  My last DexaScan and last caliper test both show that I'm between 11 and 15%.  I'm 6'00"" / 160 and a triathlete.  Body calculated me at 23% and near unhealthy.  A few other athletes I've talked to have had vastly over measured body fat readings.  But that does not mean this function is worthless.  I actually think it might be the absolute best thing a person can use at home to measure changes in body composition over time, especially for the few bucks it cost for the membership.  I would ignore the body fat percentage number and focus more on how the looks of your 3D avatar changes over time.Now for the elephant, Tone.  When I first read about Amazon's new band, they advertised that they could measure recovery and your daily well-being from the tone of your voice over time.  I called BS at the time.  Within the fitness industry, this isn't a thing, has not been really discusses as an upcoming thing and has very, very, very little data to support it.  They have since walked that claim back.  Now it is advertised to only be able to tell you how you sound to others.  Well, I have ears.  The major concerns, which I'm of the opinion is correct, is that this is a another device for Amazon to collect data about you, what you are doing and what you are buying.  Having said that, you can turn off the microphone with a button.  At least that's what Amazon says.  I am going to run tests in the coming weeks.  I'm going to have some discussions about consumer products with friends that I don't every, every use.  We will see if they start popping up on my Amazon account.Bottom line:  Halo is a solid, but very basic, fitness and sleep tracker.  It is not good if you want higher end data.  Body is interesting and might prove to be very beneficial, if the data is used though a certain lens, understanding the limits of the technology.  Finally, Tone people might find concerning.  I do and I'm former law enforcement that worked as a tech and computer forensics detective.",3
22,"I love Amazon products, but the HALO is a very beta, extreme beta testing product. I am willing to give it a chance though, because when Amazon first release the Echo it only had one feature I liked, but over time it has progressed so much that other companies began to imitate it. So far here are the features, I have used starting with the highest rated in my opinion.  HALO FeaturesSleepThe sleep tracker is the best I have seen. It does a very good job of knowing when you are asleep and when you are awake. It even helps with my echo devices. Somehow it knows when I am about to fall asleep and lower my light's brightness (which scared the beejeesus out of me the first time). The only drawback is that it is hard to discern when your awake hours in the middle of the night. I think if it can tell you at what time you were awake, I would love it even more. I know people who sleepwalk so it'll be cool to know if the device can register that.VoiceIt is one of the features with which I am having fun. It is nice to know how you sound. I thought I sounded pleasant, despite being irritated all the time, the Halo was able to detect it from my voice. So, I am learning to be better. The one thing, is that it is very hard to know the time of voice detection unless you specifically press the record button. the voice feature should be more detailed. An example is to say sound pleasant from this time to this time, instead of just for 5 mns around such and such time. It is just me nitpicking at the App, because I expect more from Amazon.StepsThe steps are not super accurate. I compared it with the Garmin watch (I know not truly a fair comparison). The steps were off by 500-2000. Right now, I have 2009 on my Garmin and 2574 on the Halo. The Garmin is more accurate because I literally counted my steps and compare and they are usually only off by a couple of steps. The halo needs to be improved for accuracy.LabI tried using one of the labs, but it turned out to be just a reminder and not an active workout as I thought. I am planning to use another one soon to be able to review.BodyDid not use yet, because I am a bit skeptical of the whole delete picture. I have not had time to read the entire privacy notice to see if it is something, I am willing to give a chance. I'll update in the future.  Issues with HaloThe main issue I have is that the Halo is not integrated with a lot of popular apps that most people have been using to track other aspect of their fitness. It does not integrate with Apple health, loseit, FitnessPal, or others. Since the Halo is so limited, it should integrate with other app who are already good at tracking other health data. There is no place to put food or water intake. it would love to have that feature added.The second issue is viewing data. There is not quick way to view the data except on the app through the phone. I wish it has a button to press that can show at least one quick data directly on the Halo Band. It can be steps, times, or total points. I have to find my phone and click on the app every time I need to view my data. I think if they integrate Alexa in future version, it'll make the watch better. One can Ask Alexa whit time is it, or how many points I have for the day/total, or how many steps I have for the day/total. It is nice not having the distracted screens, but they still should be easily accessible.The other issue is band color. I got the pink because it looked cute. It was a terrible mistake. The band got dirty very fast and became uglier and uglier over time. I recommend to just buy the black.The device too had some issues. The color started fading into a greyish color after the first week. I called and was told that no one else had that issue. Since I had to get a replacement for other issues (listed in next paragraph), I am waiting to see if my new device change color as well.I had an issue with connectivity and syncing. My first Halo cause a lot of issues. It will not pair with the app and would give an error message. It happened after I first charged the device. I called Amazon. After 30 minutes of the customer service reps tried to figure out what is a Halo and who is responsible for service for it, I found someone who really helped solve the issue. Since, it could not be solved, I was sent another band. I have only started using the new band for a few days, I don't know about the previous issue. So far though, I have not had an issue with syncing the Halo with the app. I will wait to see if it becomes a problem again.Finally, the battery life is a joke. You get one of two days at most. If you turn on time, you get 12 -15 hours at most. I wear my Halo to work, by the time I get home it has to be charged again, then again when I wake up in the morning. It is one of the worse issue with the Halo, in my opinion.  Overall RatingSo far, the device is only better in voice and sleep tracking. I know that over time, Amazon will make upgrades and I am waiting to see how well they advance. I am okay with giving this device a chance because I can see the potential. However, if you are looking for a comprehensive fitness device, the HALO is not there yet.3.5 overall.",3
23,"1/17/2021 Update at bottom!First off, I don't find the Halo to be particularly comfortable, even after over a month of daily use. Maybe it's the fabric band that digs into my wrist, maybe it's the plastic edge of the Halo itself, but whatever it is, this isn't as comfortable as any other wristwatch or fitness tracker I've ever worn. I used to have one of those Jawbone trackers that was a square-ish band twisted into a split-ring kind of thing, and that was comfortable and unobtrusive (until it suddenly died.) I've tried wearing the Halo on my left wrist overnight for sleep tracking, which is where I normally wear a wristwatch during the day, thinking that maybe that wrist was more used to having a thicker band around it; nope, the Halo is just as uncomfortable on that wrist as it is on the right. And I don't mean it's painfully uncomfortable or unwearable, just that it's more irritating than I'd expected, and I haven't got used to it at all. I'm thinking that they should've included the silicone band that is sold separately, or just offered the Halo with that one as an alternative to the fabric strap, especially considering they're selling the Halo in multiple size and color variants, so it's not like they're averse to offering multiple SKUs.Battery life seems decent, at least for my usage; it goes down to around 85% after ~24 hours of use, and I charge it up to full every day while I shower. I wear it overnight for sleep tracking. I figure if it lasts almost a week on a full charge now, and I can easily recharge it every day, that gives it plenty of extra capacity a few years down the line when the battery is starting to wear out and doesn't last as long.On that subject, the included charging dock thingy kind of sucks. It's a plastic clamp thing that's kind of slippery, especially with clean hands, and is easy to spring out of my hand; the fact that the spring-loaded hinge is most of the way towards one side means there's very little surface area to grip and pinch, and the lack of any texturing makes it surprisingly difficult to squeeze open. Also, the Halo band doesn't easily slip onto the charging contacts; you have to make sure to place it in the correct orientation and then squeeze the jaws of the dock/cradle/clamp/whatever to make sure they make contact. Overall it's quite a poorly-designed accessory, and I don't think a magnetic dock would've been too much to ask for.The software kind of sucks as well. The Android app does feature the relevant stats that I want tracked, but then has a bunch of extra stuff that I can't get rid of. The live pulse monitoring does seem to work well, and the device does at least give the appearance of competently tracking steps and sleep, although I can't be sure of how *accurate* any of this is. The worst part however is that the app is very sluggish, especially to display data, to the point where it's easy to be unsure if I'm looking at the right day's stats when I flip between them; the app lets you switch to another day/week but then takes a few seconds to load stats that may or may not have been synchronized. It's just so slow that there's always the question of, ""is it still loading, should I wait, did it not sync with the Halo?""And on *that* topic, I'm now at the point where, as of a couple days ago, the Halo appears to be operating (i.e. it charges, it can be reset, the status light works, etc.) but is no longer connecting to the app. I've reset it a couple times, made sure it's fully recharged, restarted my phone, cycled bluetooth, etc. My next steps are to reinstall the app, and then perhaps hard reset the Halo. I *really* shouldn't have to fight with this thing at only about a month into ownership, but that's where I'm at. I'll update this if I get it fixed, or maybe if I *can't* get it fixed and have to return it, or if something else notable comes up.Update: resetting the app does nothing other than make you set it up from scratch again; the problem was with the Halo itself. I had to factory reset it after all, which did clear out any data collected since the last time it synced but fortunately everything else on my profile appears to have been restored. There was a firmware update immediately available for the Halo, and it applied successfully. I'm not sure how often it updates itself in the background (e.g. when I have it docked and charging, while I'm in the shower) but perhaps the last firmware introduced a syncing issue that was remedied with this *new* firmware, but as I just did all this immediately before updating this review, I'm just making assumptions at this point. All I can say now is that the Halo appears to be syncing again, and I'll post another revision if anything changes.The Halo was probably a decent option for *just* a fitness tracker at the pre-release discounted price. At its full MSRP, however, I don't think it's worth it considering how many people already have smart watches that include the basic tracking features (e.g. steps, sleep, etc.) in a package that's maybe a few hundred bucks to begin with. On top of that, of course, this is a first-gen product and we're all kind of beta testers for it, and I'm already running into some frustrating issues with it.Update: Since writing the above, the Halo has not had a repeat of the connection issue that required the factory reset and has worked as expected since then. Also, I finally received the optional silicone band and have used it exclusively since receiving it about 3 weeks ago. As expected, it's far more comfortable than the cloth band and should've been the stock band. I'll write more about it in a review on that product itself.",3
24,"I got this band very early on as a prime member before it was available for general public purchasing so I’ve been using it since November. Had I reviewed it after the first month or two it would be 4 stars. Now it is barely usable so you’re getting a legit honest review from someone actually using it daily for 3months.The bad- why I dropped it to two stars:The battery life gets worse with use and was never great to start with.If you use the voice software you need to charge it every 2 days. That’s not so bad, but as time goes on it gets worse and worse. Today my band was at 100% at 11am and now at 3pm it’s at 47%. I haven’t been able to really use the band in weeks since it started doing this as it needs to spend more time on the charger than on my wrist. I tried contacting tech support and I’m left on infinite hold. This alone is why I would not recommend the product unless you don’t intend to use it for longer than two months. By month 3 your battery is trash and there’s no way to fix it.For those who are still interested- there are a lot of good features and some that need work. I write this with some hope that perhaps Amazon will look at these reviewsAs they continue to work on the product because it would be amazing!The Components:- Body fat percentage is easy and creates a nice visual for those super concerned about losing/gaining weight, muscle and body mass. It is not detailed beyond your body average though. For example- my chest is significantly larger than the average woman. The scan shows it in the image but there is no data that tells me what % of my body fat is attributed to my big boobs V. my stomach.  This is closer to one of those apps that tells you what celeb you look like based off of a photo than a scientific review of your body.-Activity Tracking:  as long as the band is charged and synced to the app (more on that below) the activity tracking is my favorite component. It happens automatically, and tracks heart rate, Cals burned and length of workout. Here’s where it goes south though: if you take some breaks like say- you’re running for 15min and walking for 5min, then running for 15min. As your heart rate decreases and goes back up your workout gets logged as multiple sessions. I haven’t figured out what the trigger is for it to separate but I’ve had days where a single workout is logged at 4-5 different ones. Very annoying if you’re trying to move the cals burner or other info over to a different tracker or just want to know your totals. Additionally- you are limited to the activity titles preset. So if you’re doing unique exercises and want to label them to track the difference (like what your heart rate and cals burned look like for say a HIT spin class V. a regular spin class) there is no way to clearly label.Voice Software: this is what sold me on the halo. As a professional who works with folks across the country I really interested in understanding how the tonality of my voice comes across. Unfortunately the way the app reports the information isn’t really helpful for any really meaningful review. You get info such as ‘at 1:04pm you said something that sounded angry or uncertain and at 1:10 you sounded happy’. Well- that’s not really helpful when you’re on calls and don’t know exactly what part of that 30min call was happening at 1:04 V. 1:10. It also eats up the battery life and now that at the 3mo mark of having it my battery doesn’t stay charged for even 12hrs the voice component is just automatically turned off.  This is really only useful for two scenarios: 1.  You use the live tracker and are watching it while you’re talking. Not really useful for the real world. Or 2. You just want to know on average how you’re sounding day to day or if you’re more cheerful sounding in the morning or at night. Very general sort of stuff.- Goals: the activity points and goals are the best feature by far. However you don’t get to create your own goals which is annoying. So if you’re a relatively sedentary person looking to get your activity to a baseline ‘active’ this will be helpful. But if you’re already relatively active looking to increase that activity to the next level you cannot increase your goals in the app to help you get there. So this feature is relatively useless for anyone who is looking for more than to help them not be sedentary.- The Labs: not flexible enough for real life. Part of developing healthy habits is flexibility but these demand perfection. You’re on their timeline for how many weeks the lab should run and you have no ability to add info of you forgot to track one day or adjust your timeline if you miss a day. This is a great idea in theory - you get your quantitative read outs each day and get to see how the labs change what that looks like. Brilliant! Another big selling point for me. But the execution just isn’t there.-There’s no food tracking and no ability to add any personal goals. Super disappointing and forces you to use multiple trackers.Huge Miss:The band will disconnect sometimes and always will if your phone is far away, you turn off your Bluetooth or the band dies. There is no alert that tells you this. So you’re wearing your band thinking it’s connect and it’s not. You also only get battery warnings on your phone at 20% and 10%. So if you’re not staring at your phone you miss it, it does, and you don’t know unless you’re actively looking at the app. They really need to have some sort of a vibration function you can turn on to alert you to the band disconnecting and battery life. It also needs to have a battery than doesn’t crap out in 3 months.Overall- I would not recommend this first version of the Halo due to the battery dying (and I see I’m not the only one with the issue). It’s a solid first attempt but it never should have made it past testing with a 3month life like this.  If Amazon fixes the tech issues and creates more customization options in the app AND provides a decent trade in option for those of us with the first model then I’d give the second generation I’m sure they’re already working on a chance.",2
25,"I really enjoy this tracker, I've used applewatch, samsung, and fitbits before. If you're just looking for something to track steps and heartrate then you can get a something a little cheaper and be happy.Physical attributes:- I'm a huge fan of the no display (less distractions in the gym) and it is advertised as no display, please don't expect to view time or notifications on this thing.- The actual device is a bit thick but it's not too bad, if you think the band is too tight, then it probably is. I am an incredibly light sleeper and I sleep with this on every night since I purchased it (Nov.19th) and don't think it has ever affected my sleep. I typically don't ever have to mess with the band unless I'm taking off to charge/shower (it is water resistant but there's no point in getting it wet if you don't have to plus this is typically when I charge it)-  The battery life is great imo, I charge it once a week while I'm taking a shower or something and it completely charges in about 30min if not sooner for me. I do not use the tone analysis which drains the battery, and I only open the app to view heartrate when I'm towards the end of a run to see how much higher I can push. Live HR results says it also drains battery faster if you leave it open.-  Going to order the sports band but as of now I just have the fabric and have no complaints on it so far, seems good quality.Software:-  This is where things get a little fuzzy for me, but thankfully fixing the app is one of the easier things Amazon can do to improve the experience.-  I'd like to get notifications on my phone if my HR is getting crazy high.-  The sleep analysis seems fairly accurate, I've noticed waking up from nightmares and my watch tells me that I went straight from REM sleep (the dreaming state) to awake. Time to fall asleep seems inaccurate, but full sleep time still gives a good estimate. This can help you pinpoint when you should aim to be in bed. Remember, if you awake during deep sleep, this can lead to you feeling like crap all day, if you notice the band saying your alarm always wakes you up during deep sleep, change your bedtime.-  I do not like that you can't zoom in on graphs to view specific times that your HR was super high or a specific time that you were disturbed in your sleep. You can estimate what times these things happened but I'd like to see more accurate times i.e. ""your highest HR of today was at 6:34PM"" or "" you had three disturbances in your sleep, they happened at these times ...""-  I do not use the labs or tone analysis so I can't give an accurate review on those, but I'm under the impression that they are pretty helpful. Most of my fitness research just comes from hours of youtube.-  BODY SCAN, I really enjoy this feature and it was one of the main reasons why I wanted this. Is it going to be completely accurate? No of course not, almost nothing is when it comes to Body fat (BF) %. I get a bio-impedance scan every month and according to that I'm at around 13% BF which I know is inaccurate. However, the number isn't so important, what's important is to scan frequently and notice trends over time. If your Halo says you're 25% BF and you scan weekly and notice in 3 month you had a gradual decrease to 22% BF. Then you can at least say, ""hey this number may not be accurate for my overall BF but I can see that I lost 3% BF"" which is the real benefit of this imo. With that being said, Halo says I'm around 16.4% BF I actually believe that this is closer to my real BF than the 13% the bio-impedance scan says that I am. So in my case, Halo seems more  accurate than my other source. No you DO NOT NEED to get naked to scan yourself and I wouldn't recommend it anyway, just wear some underwear, you can even cover your face if you so choose.Pricing:-  At the early access stage this thing was $65 which is very competitive to the name brand fitness trackers, at full MSRP this thing gets closer to some other brands. At $100 I'd still buy it for me personally and I would still recommend it, it should only get better from here.TLDR; My main reason for getting this band was for the sleep analysis and the BF scanner which both work good imo. I like that it doesn't have a distracting screen, battery good, app can use some work and I imagine that it will receive some updates in the near future. Price was very competitive at the early access stage but I'd still recommend this for it's features at $100",4
26,"So this is a review after about a week of use, so may revise with more time. I have experience with various fitness and sleep trackers, including Samsung Health (currently via Galaxy Active 2), Fitbit (albeit not recently), and Withings Sleep (currently).As an activity tracker, it seems about equal with others I have used. I do prefer the way the Halo app handles calories burned better than Samsung Health, and in general the app presentation is a bit better than both Samsung Health and Google Fit. The heart rate tracking matches my Galaxy Active 2, though neither are particularly accurate for real-time cardio exercise monitoring. If you want accurate heart rate tracking while going for a run for instance, a chest strap is probably a much better option, albeit less convenient.The sleep tracking seems to match up well against Withings Sleep, more or less. For sleep tracking alone, Withings Sleep is more convenient in that you install under mattress and then it takes care of everything from there. But if you want the other features of a fitness tracker, then Halo seems both similarly accurate and convenient to the extent you are wearing it all the time anyway. The problem with Samsung Health (Galaxy Active 2) for sleep tracking is that you really need to charge the watch at night, which either renders the sleep tracking useless or means you will need to take it off during the day to charge.What really differentiates Amazon Halo is the body composition, tone tracking, and movement analysis - I am a fan of two of three, undecided on the third.Time will tell, but I think the body composition is pretty useful. I suspect many won't like because the reality check may be disappointing, both in the 3D visual and the body fat reading - we all prefer good news. I have used a Withing Body+ scale (BIA technology) for years and have long suspected it gave me more favorable body fat % readings than reality - I liked the favorable readings, but false reality is not actually helpful in the end. Amazon Halo's Body Composition's body fat measure was a lot higher than my Withings scale. Looking the studies they have done, I suspect that Withing's body is underestimating body fat % by about 7% and Amazon Halo is overestimating by about 2%, which would be broadly consistent with the average error terms of each of these technologies in the studies they conducted. Using together, I think I have a much better read on reality, though I would be curious to have a dexa scan some day to truly level set. I also suspect the Halo's 3D renderings will be useful over time to visually understand progress on diet and exercise, regardless of what the specific body fat percentage statistics are (and my wife attests that the 3D visual rendering of my body is in fact accurate......unfortunately).The movement analysis is actually pretty interesting as well. For a long time I have been working on posture, mobility, and core strength, including recently with a professional (highly recommend somebody trained in NKT). It took me a long time to realize how important these are, and how beneficial it is to focus on them.  The Halo movement assessment seemed accurate enough to be useful, and the recommended excerises actually seem quite useful, enough so that I have added to my routine.I haven't really decided how I feel about the tone analysis - I am curious, but it would not be a reason for me to buy. There is a battery cost to using it, and remains to be seen if it is worth it. I have worried at times that when I come home over tired from work that I might not project the best ""tone"" when catching up with my wife, so for now I have set it to turn on only during that time window. It's readings are a bit haphazard for now (not in what is reported, but in how much is conversation is actually measured/analyzed), so not much to say on that so far. I will say it that in these early days it has made me much more aware of what I am projecting, which maybe is the point. I could both see myself just shutting off this feature, or discovering value in the feedback. Currently I am not at point where I am really sure either way.As far as form factor goes, the Amazon Halo is comfortable to wear and inconspicuous, which in my view is positive. The most obvious design flaw is the charging clip....it's finicky and you need to double check it has actually connected and the device is charging. I could easily seen putting it in the clip only to find later the contacts didn't connect and it hadn't charged.One other nitpick would be interoperability with other health apps. Given the partnership with Lifesum in terms of nutrition education, might have at least expected integration with that app.",5
27,"At this point I’ve had the halo band for 1yr.1. The band itself is extremely uncomfortable to wear unfortunately. The band has to be pretty snug around your wrist enable for a lot of the features to function properly.  Because of the snug fit (and mind you I still wear my band to where I could at least fit my pinky finger underneath it) it leaves a bruise on my wrist and for that reason I can’t wear it, it’s extremely uncomfortable. Despite the bruise I would still wear it I just take it off in intervals so that I can get brakes.2. Now the halo band when you first get it comes with a six month free trial for Amazon‘s fitness plan. it’s 299 a month after the six month free trial. Now the plan gives you exercise tips and gives you recipe ideas and it even shows you instructional videos which is awesome. The only issue is that these videos are playing on your phone. So as you’re working out trying to look at the instructions it’s very hard for you to see.  Originally, the app didn’t allow you to cast the video onto a bigger screen. Complaints were made and now you can cast which is awesome.3. You need an Amazon account to use this particular device. Now it doesn’t have to be an Amazon prime account you just simply need to have an account because it links it to your Amazon shopping account. For me personally I believe that some of this information can be used for targeted advertising. I wish there was a way to use the ban even without an Amazon shopping account where you could just simply use the basic features but as of right now that doesn’t exist.Overall I love the idea of this band I love the different features that it has I also love that it doesn’t base everything off of the BMI. The BMI is based off of a Caucasian male, which is extremely outdated. They still have that option which is great for those that still prefers that feature. The band needs improvement but Amazon seems to be listening and updating as needed.",4
28,"The three basic features of the Halo that will continue to be free after the six month trial membership is up are the step count, the sleep time, and your heart rate.  These are the three features I wanted in the Halo so I don't need the Halo membership and my total cost will be the cost of the device.When I first got the Halo, I did have trouble finding the right angle in the charger to get it to actually charge.  The first night I thought it was charging and got up to find it was almost dead.  Then I fiddled with it and watched the Halo app - it told me when it was charging - so I then knew where to place it.  I also had a bit of trouble when I bought a new phone - I had to reset it to factory settings to get it to pair to the new phone.  It took a bit of frustration and less than 10 minutes until I was good to go.I have read a couple of reviews that stated it is not comfortable - I have not had that trouble.  I also have not had trouble getting the band on and off so I don't have that complaint, either.I am getting on in years and have had 1 knee, 2 hips, and 1 shoulder replaced, so I cannot do the exercises the outside companies are offering for free for 6 months.  I also looked at the ""1 minute of activity"" feature, but it was many versions of planks, so I don't do that, either.The feature I really like is the heart rate.  From almost 40 years of tennis (also why my joints are worn out) my standing heart rate is about 60.  I have a recumbent stepper which will work both arms and legs and I try to get my heart rate over 100 (not impressive if you are 30, but harder if you are almost 70).  I checked my heart rate on the Halo app when I was at my doctor's office recently and it was the same as the reading on their machine, so it seems to be accurate.  When I use the stepper, I listen to my playlist, put my phone an the machine, open the Halo app and go to the heart rate display (which is in nice, big numbers).  I work myself harder till I get my heart rate where I can stand it - so for me, this a a very good feature.I also like the sleep feature.  I read a review that thought it was way off, but it seems to track me well.  I had a fitbit a couple of years ago that told me I didn't sleep at all.  I am not a good sleeper - I usually wake up a few times and try to find a comfortable position to sleep in (my artificial shoulder does not like to be slept on).  The Halo seems to reflect those times and the results are different from day-to-day, so I think, for me, they are pretty accurate.The only other feature I care about is the number of steps, and I am not too sure it is really accurate.  I have the Samsung Health on my phone, and the Halo and Samsung do not agree on how many steps I take each day.  The Halo gives me more credit than Samsung does - I will be keeping my eye on that.After all that, do I like the Halo?  Yes, I do.  I don't care about most of the features, but the 2 features that are the most important to me seem to work for me.  Not sure if I care about the step discrepancy - I mostly care about raising my heart rate and tracking my sleep.There was one other feature I didn't mention - Tone of voice.  I am retired so I don't work each day and with the pandemic, the only person I interact with every day is my husband of almost 43 years.  At this point,  I am not too worried about my tone of voice so I didn't even bother with that.  I have read that ""Tone"" uses a lot of battery - with it turned off, I  charge my Halo once per week, which is not bad.",4
29,"I’ve had the Halo for a little over a month now and it definitely has its pros and cons. I also have some suggestions for updates to the app. I like that the band doesn’t have a screen. I was debating getting an Apple Watch, but I didn’t want another screen constantly distracting me. Not having a screen and not having to think about the band doing it’s job is nice! I love the point system for tracking activity. This is the first time I’ve ever really felt motivated to really meet a fitness goal, that being at least 150 points. At first I thought that seemed like a large goal, but now after weeks of using the band, it’s very easy to surpass 150 and get over 200 or even close to 300 by the end of each week. The sleep tracker is a nice function. I’ve been used to for the past few years not getting decent sleep. The app tracks how often I wake up and gives me suggestions for how to improve my sleep. I think the workouts the app provides have good variety, such as yoga, cardio, and stretching. But I definitely think it has its cons. While the workouts can be fun and there are lots of them, I wish there were more fat people friendly ones. I’ll admit I’m not the skinniest person and I got this band to try and motivate me to lose some weight. A lot of the workouts seem to be for people who already are in shape or who are used to working out. I definitely am not and had to stop part way through a lot of the workouts because they were just too much for me. Even the beginner courses seemed very difficult. Having workouts that involve a lot of jumping or getting up and down off the floor quickly are not good for me... But there are still some good ones on there for those who are already good at working out or know what they’re doing. The Tone function seemed cool at first, and was actually one of the reasons I was interested in buying the band. But after a month, it just seems super gimmicky. I forget it’s there half the time and it doesn’t seem super accurate with describing how I sound. It also drains the battery like crazy. With Tone on, I’d have to charge the band every day. With it off, it lasts 4-5 days on a single charge. I only recently decided it was better to just keep the function off. About the body scanner, I’m not sure I buy how accurate that function really is yet. I haven’t done too many scans yet to really tell if it’s working, but I’m unsure about it. I wish in the fitness tracker part there was a way to input my own workout type into it. This might sound stupid, but I use a VR headset to do a lot of my working out. It really makes me break a sweat and get moving! There obviously isn’t a VR option when picking, so I usually have to pick either Dance or Boxing depending on the game I’m playing. And finally, my suggestions. While the app provides lots of good programs, like ones to get you to drink more water, ones to help with stress and anxiety, and even healthier eating ones, I wish it had a few more functions. It would be nice to have an actual food tracker of some sort, or a way to take notes so I can track those things myself. It doesn’t need to be a calorie counter, but something simple so ai can keep better track of my eating habits. Same goes with a water intake tracker. Something that would allow me to input how many bottles of water I’ve drank and whatnot. This one might seem weird since it’s a physical fitness band, but how about something that I can log how I feel mentally throughout the day? Mental health is just as important as physical health. And I think that’s about it for suggestions. All in all, I like the band. It could definitely use some improvements in the app, but it’s working great for me and that’s what matters. I’m hoping that I’m able to continue my weight loss and health journey by continuing to use Halo!",4
30,"I had a difficult time finding the right tracking band after using Michael KORS rope band tracker which became obsolete. Found this band, although not as pretty as the MK. I just needed a simple step & sleep tracker without all the complications of a large, obtrusive band on my wrist. Wish it had the heart & BP but understand that these both aren’t reliable in any watch. This is a plain band that easily straps on & off & look forward to purchasing a few other bands for exchanges with different outfits.  Keeps track of my steps & sleep pattern although not sure the sleep monitor works that well. For ex, I went to bed last night at 11:24 & my Halo said 9:24? Don’t have a clue what’s going on? Hope another reviewer can offer some help with this? Also this band didn’t ask for measurement of my stride? Thought that would be important in assessing my steps, so I’m a little puzzled? Will do a follow-up review if some of these quirks can be figured out.",4
31,"I am very (very) hard on watches, and while the idea of a smart watch (such as my wife's Apple watch) is appealing, it's still overkill for what I really want: a decent heart rate monitor and sleep tracker. I don't have to do the Dick Tracy thing and dictated texts on my wrist.The price was what sold me (I got it on ""Today's Deals"" for $40).  For that price, you don't get a display, other than on the phone app, and a plain fabric band that I'm OK with for now.  Set up was easy, and it charges very fast (an hour at most), and the battery lasts almost a week, although I understand that the ""voice tone"" thing (which I don't use) cuts that way down.So, the two things I wanted:1) Heart rate monitor.  It's not an Apple watch; it just tracks heartrate, not afib or other medical issues.  Today I was on a stair machine at the gym, with a built-in heartrate monitor, and the two disagreed about half of the time.  The machine was very steady, showing me right around 120 for the bulk of my 30-minute workout (verified by me taking my own pulse), while the Halo (as displayed on my phone, a Pixel 4a) was all over the place: 60, then 90, then 120, then 70.2) Sleep app.  Impossible to know how well calibrated it is of course, but it does seem to track that fairly well.  There are quirks  in the algorithm, which is understandable, but the report is pretty straightforward.Overall, at $40 it's a good buy for my purposes -- just general tracking of how active I am and how well I'm sleeping. If I had health concerns I'd definitely want to go with something more accurate, but right now this will do.",4
32,"I like the halo. Nice that it doesn't have a screen, syncs to your phone when you need to look at data, and is comfortable. But, my old fitbit was just better. Especially for tracking sleep. The halo only takes between 10pm and 6am because that's what I told it to do. If I wake up in the middle of the night, it doesn't always track the awake time and if I take a nap in the middle of the day. It doesn't track. Example..I didn't sleep well the other night and I woke up at 1:30am. The 20 min I was awake wasn't tracked. I woke up at 5am and played on my phone for an hour, halo tracked that as me sleeping. I finally went back to sleep at 6am and slept for 2.5 hours, but since that was outside my sleep time, it doesn't show on my tracker. Battery, heart rate, and activity is also better or same on fitbit and fitbit is better in the water since they don't have a fabric band. More expensive, but Fitbit is still the standard.",4
33,"I am an amazon devices fan, and when I saw the add for this tracker I was hooked!I have to say I am also an apple watch user (I still use both), but I am in love with this tracker.With my apple watch I used to set 30 mins workout - and that was it, that was my goal for the day; and I thought that was enough.  I did 30 min yoga sometimes 60, and I felt as if I had done an amazing work out.  Then I bought this tracker and boy oh boy was I wrong!!  Thanks to Halo, I am now a much more active person, and less of a couch potato (most of the time)!Pro's:-  I LOVE the body scan.  you can see the difference in pictures of your progress.  Yes, you can do that with pictures outside the app, but the app reminds you when was the last time you took a pic, it shows you the pic and tells you the body fat %.  I have a smart scale and it was always telling me that my body fat was great, but I didnt feel as great.  With the pictures it all makes sense, where is your body fat located, how much should you have according to your age and weight.  It's all there!- The measurement of activity is in POINTS!!! - going back to my little story up there on how I felt 30 min yoga or 60 mins yoga was enough - I am not saying yoga is not a great exercise, I will clarify this later - I would work out for the specific time and then become a couch potato for the rest of the day.  Well guess what?  the tracker DEDUCTS points if you are still for too long.  So let's say that you did a 30 min workout, that gave you 4 points, but then you stayed still during the rest of the day... you get points less, which gives you 1 point by the end of the day and you need to make MINIMUM 150 (a week)-  It also compares your level of activity per week to the week before.  Since I got the tracker I started walking my dog more, because I did not want my points to go down!!! (the dog is happier also, so bonus points on that too!), but one week I was feeling not so that excited about walking and more excited about bingewatching netflix.  Well the tracker said: you went 15 points down this week..- If you dont have other apps for meditation, workout, etc.  the app includes some for you and automatically adds it to your activity (this is a pro and also a con for me, more on this later)- it measures your sleep nicely.  Also the time in bed, time slept, heavy sleeping, light sleeping, etc.  compared to the apple watch which only tells you ok you were asleep for 10 hrs; but not really- the battery lasts for days!!! however, I don't have the tone function active, so maybe it could be less- it charges super fast!Cons:- It is an activity tracker and it was advertised as such.  It doesn't have a watch, or a flashlight, or see your messages in it.  For that you would still need another smart watch which is a bummer.  I would definitely change to the halo alone if it had the smart watch functions.- To start I can't say that they didn't have enough partnerships with other apps - and this is something apple did not have until recently!!, however, MY app choices for meditating: Calm & 10% happier, are NOT in sync with the Halo.  Just headspace, nor is it my period tracker.  But hey it is the first tracker!  It is quite amazing even without my preferred apps!- It tracks you're walking or running, but it does not track automatically yoga.  Nor does it place the activity on top if you constantly choose it.  For instance, my two main workouts are yoga and powerwalking.  Yoga is NEVER accounted for and usually gives me 0 points - the points are given when your heartbeats per min (heartrate) raise, if they don't raise then it doesn't add any points - and also you always need to scroll down til the end to find the ""yoga"" description.  Is simple, but annoying.I hope my review helps, as I said before, I really like it and would really love for it to be improved (or maybe create a smartwatch version of it) so that I can say goodbye to my apple watch!",5
34,"The most frustrating thing about the Halo Band is I cannot get this thing to sync. It has been almost impossible for me to get the white blinking lights or even reset this band. This is my second band. The first one I still have but when I could not get this to sync with the App I thought this was done, so I went and bought a second because when it works its great. I don't use all the features but I love the sleep tracking and the activity tracking. Menus never used. Back to syncing this device. When it says the app should automatically start, well I wished it would. The band is fully charged but all I do is look at a green light and it never gets to the white blinking light. I have tried all the suggestions to get this device to sync. It just refused to do so. I never had this problem in the beginning with my first band so if there was an update in the software or something it sure did something. I have a great Wifi connection and do not live in a dead zone. I have tried several different sockets in the house (just in case) but nope this thing refuses to get on with its day for me. So I will be returning the second one back to Amazon as there is no point in keeping two devices that refuse to sync with the lousy app. Also the body biometrics scan I also could never get to work. It would jump continuously all over the place and would time out before I could do anything. So another useless part of this app. AMAZON do not sell something that does not entirely connect to lousy apps. Could you at least ensure that units work because this is so frustrating. Recently bought another device (Not Amazon). D/L and sync with their app within 10 seconds. That's how it should be.  Amazon you lost a sale here.UPDATE: Managed finally to get the band to sync. I am afraid for my phone to run out of juice so checking that every two days and I sync the band every night. So far so good. I would hate to have to try for another 3 days to get the band to sync with the app.",3
35,"EDITED 22 March 2021***Unfortunately, I've had to edit this review to take off a few stars for service. About a month after I started using the tracker, it stopped charging reliably. Sometimes it would charge over the course of many, many hours - or sometimes it would stop charging at all. (The device is meant to fully charge in 90 minutes.) When I contacted Amazon about this, they advised me that they would send out a replacement capsule immediately (and only the capsule, no band or charger), but that it might be a refurb (in other words, a used one). I decided to wait and see what I received before I got my knickers in a twist, but it did indeed turn out to be a refurbished device. I told Amazon I can't accept a refurb unless they're going to give me a discount, since I paid for new. They were unable to honor this request, but they did process a full refund instead. It's a shame because it's a great little tracker, but I have been burned by refurbs of various devices in the past and absolutely can't accept the risk of a refurbished device when I paid the price for brand new. So, just be aware that if you have any issues, this whole refurb business is in the terms of the warranty. They are not obligated to replace your broken device with a new one, per the warranty terms, and since this device is on backorder, any replacement (at this time) probably will be a refurb.******ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've only had this device for a few days (and will update accordingly later on if anything changes), but so far I am really enjoying the Halo band.What I love:- The design. The minimalist aesthetic of this band is very appealing - I am not distracted by a screen or a bulky watch face. The device itself is quite small and unassuming, though I have very slim wrists and it does look a little chunky on me. On a more normal sized wrist, it probably looks a little better.- The sleep tracking. This gives me much more insight into my sleep than my Amazfit Bip smartwatch did.-  The Programs. I think these used to be called ""Labs."" I don't see that word anywhere in the app anymore, but maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway, the Programs are great. I love that they're included on the relevant pages, too - for instance, on the Sleep data page, I can scroll down and see various sleep related Programs, such as meditations, sound programs, etc. And it's all housed within the app - it doesn't navigate me out of the app to use them. Well worth the $4/month (after 6 months free).- Body composition. To be honest, I have no clue how accurate it is, but I like having a ballpark idea of how I'm doing and what goals I can work toward.- Fitness points instead of step counting. It does count steps, if you like having that info, but more importantly, it tracks the effectiveness of your workouts by measuring your heart rate and calorie burn. Your level of exertion is more important than the number of steps you take. The point system helps me remember to get moving and get my heart rate going.- Tone. This is just really interesting to me. My partner has expressed frustration in the past that my voice doesn't match my feelings (I tend to sound very intense even if I'm not), so this might help me learn more about how I'm actually coming across.- The app itself. It's intuitive and presents all the relevant information right on the front page. It syncs quickly on command (and every hour otherwise) and shows me a snapshot of all the different features and their current datasets.What I don't love:- Tone's battery drain. I don't quite get 24hr out of a charge with the minimum amount of tone collection. I've turned Tone off for now and hopefully I can get a couple of days out of it.- Nearly naked pics. Taking them didn't bother me. What bothers me is that they're stored in a little picture-in-picture type box next to my (less lifelike) 3D model. I don't want to look at them and figured that's what the 3D model is for anyway, but there they are, visible to anyone who happens to peer over my shoulder at my phone, whenever I'm on the body composition page. I would just like the option to hide the actual photos themselves from view, so that I can show people how that part of the app works without them seeing my actual nearly-naked body.- The shape of the sensor capsule. Most smartwatches have a relatively small, flat backside that sits pretty comfortably on my wrist. The Halo's sensor is longer than previous smartwatches I've had, and doesn't have an ergonomic shape. I find my wrist gets achey after wearing it for a while. I switch wrists about once a day at least (and pop into the app to tell it I've switched - no idea if it matters, but I update it anyway).Overall, this is a great little fitness tracker - especially for the price - and at the risk of sounding like ""that person,"" I don't really understand all the negative reviews. This tracker gives me way more data than my previous ones have, and on top of that, it gives me something to DO with that data (through the helpful Programs, with a sampling of suggestions of such featured at the bottom of each dataset). A smartwatch it is not, though, and doesn't pretend to be, so if that's what you're looking for, you should keep looking. But if you're like me and enjoy collecting lots of personal wellness data without the need to interface with Facebook on your wrist, you would do well to give Halo a try.I will update this review if anything changes.",2
36,"I was in no way compensated for this product nor am I in any way affiliated to it or Amazon.This band and app are not going to be for everyone. If you want to do light exercise and get points for walking the dog and doing yard work then this is not your band. If you want to take seriously your body fat%, your moderate and intense exercise level, be held accountable for when you sit too long or for too many hours in a day/ week/ month/ measure sleep to ensure the next day's viability for an intense exercise then this is for you.As others have mentioned it takes points away from you if you are too sedentary. That's the point. A hard burst workout for 5-10 minutes a day is not going to cut it for really getting results if you sit the rest of the day. If however, you pay attention to the data it provides, use the 1000s of routines and videos it has for you by multiple fitness professionals, and adhere to using it 5 days a week you will absolutely see results. There are workouts for every level and ability of the user. There are dozens of trainers and disciplines from pilates, yoga, stretching, weight lifting, Barre and more.They have added the ability to save workouts as you browse through all the options available to you which is a nice upgrade. You can create a library of effective routines by favored instructors. I find Micahel Hildebrand to be very effective to watch and follow. The sleep tracking works as well as any other I have used and is a good guide to how restful you are and if you got enough rest to really get after it that day. Your sleep numbers are editable. So if you lie in bed a read for an hour you can edit that hour off. The step tracker seems accurate and does not give you steps for just typing or swinging your arms as Fit Bits did in the past. It uses both your steps and your heart rate to determine how hard you worked. I can walk the dogs leisurely for 3 miles and get 2 points with a heart rate of 88. Or have a heart rate of 100 and get 20 points for the same walk and distance. How hard you work and how hard your heart works helps determine the points awarded.I have had mine since June 2021 and I am averaging 400 points per week and have some weeks as high as 800 (high altitude hiking trips) When I started I had 20% body fat and I am now down to 15% body fat. I used the body fat scanner and although I felt it was too high initially I still used it to track the loss of body fat as that would be the sign of progress rather than the overall percentages were (a 5% loss is a 5% loss regardless right?!) My heart rate average resting is 60, down 3 bpm since June and this was very important to me to know as I just went to the cardiologist today and could report these stats for my 5 year check up.Long story short, you have to really get after it and really want to alter your lifestyle, mind, and body to get the most out of this service. Use the videos, the recipes, the stats and I promise you will see results. If you cannot spend that kind of time then it is perfectly acceptable to get a solid step counter, another type of fitness band, and just move, walk or do any and all you can to change your health! Everything done is better than nothing done!",4
37,"Disclaimer: I received this as part of the early access program, so some issues may or may not be a result of this.Since I have an Apple Watch for tracking sleep and fitness, I bought this entirely for the Tone feature. It sounded like a novel idea that would be super helpful in allowing me to become more aware of how I sound to others throughout the day.I quickly found out that it’s not what it advertises. It claims that it’s capable of analyzing the tone of your voice and telling you how you are coming off to others throughout the day. This would be SO eye-opening.Or at least I thought. But this clearly isn’t what it’s doing (at time of writing.) What you end up being left with are random, small chunks of analysis throughout the day that aren’t all that helpful unless you remember the specific details of every conversation or check the app immediately after it’s done analyzing the conversation. For the conversations you do remember (typically highly emotional ones with a lot of laughter or perhaps anger or sadness) you likely already know how you came off to the other person.I do think this feature has potential and will get better over time, but right now it leaves much to be desired. On the other hand, it does force one to be more aware of how they’re speaking by simply being reminded that their “tone” is being “analyzed.” This in itself is actually quite useful considering how many of us are totally unconscious of our behavior until we think back on it (and many don’t even do that).Anyway, back to my issue with Tone. You can see live, in the app, what your “tone” sounds like as you’re speaking. If I am speaking in a happy tone, but use a curse word in a positive way (e.g. that’s ******* awesome!, no ****?, get the **** outta here!), it categorizes my tone as something like irritated, disgusted, condescending, etc.Meanwhile, if I use all positive language, but with a tone that is obviously depressed and pretending (poorly) to sound happy, it categorizes it as happy. It of course isn’t capable of detecting sarcasm.It’s mind boggling to me how they are able to call this feature “Tone” when mostly it seems to just be categorizing the words that you use based on arbitrary definitions of which words are positive and which negative.It’s surprising considering AWS has so many services for machine learning and natural language processing that are capable of doing these things with text and analyzing context.So it was incredibly disappointing to find out that it’s not actually analyzing tone, but simply the words without even looking at context, let alone tone of voice. The first example above should be easily categorized as positive without needing to look at the nuances of tone. I can’t think of a situation where “that’s f****** awesome” would ever be interpreted as irritated, annoyed, dismissive, condescending, angry, etc.Tone does seem to recognize laughter and factor that in, but apparently, any use of profanity is labeled negatively in the moment the word is used. This really begs the question of who gets to decide what words are positive and negative.This makes it fairly useless when going back and looking through the conversations one had throughout the day. Did I actually sound disgusted? Or did I just happen to use a word that is in their “disgusted” category?To it’s credit, for the majority of conversations, which are typically casual and not laden with profanity, it does seem to do a decent job. I trust it maybe 80%. And as I mentioned earlier, it does remind one to be present when speaking. If one can do that, (not an easy task) then the tone being used should be highly relevant given the situation.Another positive aspect worth mentioning are the handful of voice and conversation exercises in the app that I actually learned a bit from.On to the other features.If I didn’t have an Apple Watch, the fitness and sleep features might be worth the price tag at the early access price. I wouldn’t pay the current price for this thing in its current state.The photo BMI calculator seems to be accurate and has a neat feature that simulates what your body would look like +- 20ish pounds, but stats-wise, it doesn’t give me any useful info my $20 smart scale doesn’t.It’s also a hassle to turn Tone on and off to try and conserve battery life throughout the day. Turning it on and off requires holding the button for 3 seconds, which doesn’t sound like a lot, but for me it became a nuisance so I decided to just charge it daily. No doubt this would be less of an issue if it was my only fitness tracker. The charging clip it uses is incredibly clunky and takes some finessing to line the pins up properly.With Tone on, it lasts about 1.5 days on the low setting. 1 day on high. Off, it is supposed to last 10, but lasts 5 at most. The green HR light is constantly on, which seems like a waste of battery power, and I wonder if it is a bug with mine that is causing the reduced battery life or just false advertising.On top of this, it has nearly daily issues with the connection dropping. Perhaps a number of the issues I experienced were due to it being the first batch sent out with early access.I had high hopes for this thing and the potential it has, but currently it’s just not very useful since I use my Apple Watch for everything else and charging/wearing two monitors becomes a pain.If the Tone feature worked as advertised, I would definitely come back to it, but until then, it’s not worth the hassle.",2
38,"Concept:  I wore a Fitbit for over seven years.  The original, then the Flex2. I’m accustomed to no screen. I wear an Apple Watch and I wanted the sleep tracker most of all because I charge my watch at night.First impressions after a few days:Purchase:  I “applied” for a pre-release unit. I wasn’t a “chosen” one.  After the release date I received a discount code via email.  I think if I hadn’t received that code I would not have ordered.  What a gimmick, but I fell for it, so...Setup:  Setup was easy peasy!  I downloaded the app prior to receipt so I was ready.  No glitches and it paired with no problems.Band:  The band seems like it may soil, snag and fray with time so I’m expecting to have to fork over money for a replacement if I decide to permanently replace my Fitbit Flex with this. I am not sure I like having the tail of the band where it lays on my outer left wrist but so far no problems.  I do like the cloth more than I though I might.I plan to charge it while I shower every morning because it seems like the band may retain water if I get it soaking wet.  Plus I see no reason to intentionally expose it to hot soapy water daily.Replacement bands seem a bit pricey so I’ll hope to see if third party bands arrive on the scene.Charger and charging:  The charger seems easy enough to use but I expect the hinge will wear out and break over time.  Of course I expect to see a redesign of this eventually with a healthy price tag...  When my Fitbit charger gave me problems they sent me a new charger free, and it was out of warranty.  They also replaced my Fitbit unit out of warranty when I had problems. Class act, Fitbit.  I’ll miss you.My first Fitbit would last over a week on one charge so I had a routine to charge it every Monday.  My Flex only lasted five days and I never got used to that weird length of time.  If I decide to keep tone turned on I’ll have to see how I want to deal with charging if the shower approach is insufficient.Wearability and functionality:  It’s comfortable.  I forget I’m wearing it.I would miss having the notifications for incoming texts but since I wear my Apple Watch except in bed,  it’s fine.I wish it integrated with My Fitness Pal.  I’m going to miss that.I have tone turned on but would like a timely notification if my tone is disagreeable. Otherwise what’s the point to having me look at the app hours later to discover I was not coming off well to a colleague, client or family member?The app looks clean enough but I haven’t really explored it much.Not a fan of the subscription approach since I had a Fitbit with no fees, so I will have to really fall in love with some of the subscription features if I’m going to let them “cha-ching” me after the six free months. Deducted a star just for that.Co$t$:  Subscription should be free with Prime membership!The price of the unit was reasonable at $64.99Replacement bands are too expensive.  I’d like to swap out colors like I do with my Apple Watch.  Hoping third party bands hit the market soon...I expect I’ll want a second charger to put in my travel bag and maybe a third for the summer place.  But I’ll wait to see if a redesign appears because the charger is a hinged clip which seems a bit fragile for long term.Lab:  I’ll update after I check out some of the features in the “lab”.  I like the concept of the lab.  Should be fun but likely the novelty will wear off unless the developers come up with some great ideas.",4
39,"**update**In my opinion there is a mental trick to successfully using this device. I suggest thinking of it as a game or experiment. Take the information as interesting instead of insulting. Most people who are interested in this device likely are interested in improving themselves, so the device showing you were sedentary for 10 hours isn't the same as the device judging you as lazy. It's factually showing you didn't move around much for 10 hours. Maybe you're writing a book or coding and got into the flow, maybe you were sitting with a friend, maybe you were fully exhausted from some stress, maybe you wanted a lazy day, it doesn't matter. It's reporting the information and it is interesting. I've noticed that now when my body wants rest after a sedentary time I can now decide that walking around is a kind of mental rest just to see if it changes the score. Then it does! And my brain feels rested after walking around a bit. I don't think most healthy humans have to join an intense program of body crushing workouts to get basically great results. But now that I see how much more energy I have, I'm considering it, which a massive attitude change for me. Pretend it's an old  Tamagotchi from the 90s that you found on a drawer, for kicks you turn it on and it's still sort of alive. Or a plant in the clearance section that needs a little attention. You feed and water and love it by doing these things for yourself, try less hard, experiment. It can become fun, you might accidentally start trying hard just because it's so fun.In only a couple of weeks I'm sleeping better, eating better, moving around and with more ease, my goal was updated from 150 to 300 and now to 600 per week. I'm not dieting, I'm only mildly working out sort of half-heartedly just for fun, I've lost weight sure but I've gained so much more.It's like a diagnostic for a vehicle but you're the vehicle. It doesn't diagnose disease obviously but it does give factual information on operations which for me has meant I treat myself with the care I actually need in order to gain these imaginary points. However, gaining these points makes me feel physically and mentally well, almost by accident. Yes I lose points when I am too sedentary, but overall I'm less sedentary than before halo. It's almost unconscious.**The reviews are very hot and cold on halo, but I'm glad I tried this out. It takes a little time to figure it out, but the app takes you through it. I didn't have to try very hard to ""get it"" because it's introduced over time.It feels good onIt doesn't buzz or notify me of anythingI can't accidentally dismiss a notification or reply to a messageIt looks coolI forget I'm wearing itThe battery life is unbelievably goodIt has actually helpful sleep encouraging apps that work and I struggleIf you turn on the Tone option it will give insight on your communicationIt's 150 points a week not a day. About 8.5 hours of my day is spent in front of my computer. This measures that time as, ""sedentary"" and then measures my other activities on a scale from light to intense.I do not feel judged by this non-sentient device. I'm a thinking person who understands the need for rest and reset. However, it does feel a little bit like being your own character in a video game that only you are playing. When I do well I'm proud of my ""player"" and when I do a little less well I'll get them next time. I think this has the power to make me a fan of myself in a way. I'm rooting for myself and there is no fail or big boss bowser at the end of this game. Just replay, no quarters needed, be a fan of yourself and make progress over time. It's a learning app not a diet app and you are the subject in a way that isn't just indulgent and toxically positive.My family and friends are getting them too because they see how much fun I'm having!",5
40,"If you don't to want read my full review here is my thoughts on who should or should not get a Halo:1. If you are an intermediate to advanced athlete looking to dive deep into the data to take your training to the next level, look else where. The Halo is not there yet.2. If all you do is basic activity tracking and you already own a Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin or any smart watch for that matter, stick with what you already own, Halo is not going to add that much more value to you. (I will talk more about Labs, Tone and Body Composition below, the only unique things on the Halo)3. If you are looking for basic activity tracking, looking to maintain some basic general health(physical/mental) and need some basic guidance along the way, and don't own anything I mentioned above, Halo could be for you.So now for my impressions:The Pros:Good battery life went a full 7 days on a single charge with about 5% left before charging it. (Did not configure Tone). Although I noticed over time the battery life hovers around 5 days depending on how much activity you doBody composition seems like a unique and useful feature to measure your progress. (Although the progress charts could be improved in the body composition section, meaning how am I improving from previous scans. The band needs to show more metrics there)I like the point system because it helps you force yourself to hit a goal based on intensity vs just achieving a step count which is not a true measure of improvement of fitness level IMHO.Some of the Labs are useful especially around nutrition and meditation. (note I said ""some"" labs)Sleep tracking seems fairly accurate and found it useful, now I know why I am tired all the timeI like the small and thin design of the band. Actually the thinest non screen band I have seen on the market.The app it self is easy enough to navigate and the setup process is easy and straight forward.The monthly price is cheaper than other fitness trackers that charge a monthly feeCons:I don't see the value of the Tone feature. I already know how I sound and how I come across to people, and if my tone is bad so what, is the band going to slap me when I sound aggravated and tell me to be nice? Not to mention it constantly recording me. (Yes I know you can mute it at times)The reporting and aggregation of activity is lacking and probably my biggest issue with Halo. Drilling down into the data is non-existent and not intuitive. For example, there is no ability to take your sleep data and your activity data and know if you are properly recovering after a tough workout. Also there is no real reporting to determine if the type of activity you're doing is improving your fitness level. No way to report on improvement of heart rate function. It shows nothing more than any other fitness band shows.Outside of seeing a picture of yourself on the body composition screen, you can get the same data on a regular scale that measures BMI. ( I tested it and its fairly close with what Halo and my regular scale has measured)As I mentioned earlier the labs are ok, but would be nice to have labs to choose from a library of some sorts. For example if your an experienced athlete who likes running or something like CrossFit, give the user the ability to chose activities more at their level. This would also give you the ability to measure if you're pushing your self, properly recovering and ultimately improving health level. (Doing this by body composition alone I am not sure is a good measure of health)Also you can not stream the labs to a TV, so watching them on your phone sucks to be honest. Also the workouts in the labs you can probably find for free on youtube if you really wanted to.I think one design improvement is to have a swap-able battery so you can charge one and have one on the band. Although this is not a huge deal for me as the charging is pretty fast but some might find it important.Its missing important metrics like HRV, EKG, Vo2, etc. These are all features available in any fitness tracker on the market today. If Halo is going to market to the ""athlete"" they will need to provide the ability to measures stress levels, cardiovascular fitness, etc..Thats all for now, I will update as I learn more but for now, I am struggling to find the value in what the Halo brings, we will see how they do as the technology progresses.",3
41,"[Update: After waiting for many more months for the app owners to remove the ridiculous ""anti-cheerleader"" (to quote another reviewer) features, the band now sits in my junk drawer and I cancelled my subscription.  It's such a pity, as the device is great and I don't have a good substitute (without a screen/face), so I just carry my phone to track distance and have no sleep or heart rate tracking at all.  The hard-headed ways of the dev team are just stunning, and reflect what happens when a team in a (now admittedly virtual) room gets too distant from it's customer base... especially those who likely don't match the demographic of the developers themselves.  A sign of the times, I guess, and such a missed opportunity to help incremental millions (no hyperbole).  Do yourself a favor, and read the reviews before buying.  If you're like me, and don't live the life of an under-30 who has massive time to fight against the decrementing scoring, save yourself a TON of frustration and walk away from this platform.]This is a great start for a smart band, but I almost threw it out due to the app.  Others I know feel similarly.The device itself is great.  Full five stars.  Light, unobtrusive, reliable, and with a seven day charge it’s hard to beat.  I have no trouble wearing it 24/7 for days in a row.  Charging cable/device is easy peesy as well.  All good.The band is solid.  Lightweight, comfortable, handles showering (and soap, etc.) with ease.  No problems in any environment, whether exercising, sleeping, etc... and it looks good, as well.  I actually get compliments on it from time to time.  What keeps it from being five stars?  The multiple rubber detents on the band make it very inconvenient to put on and take off, especially if you have large hands, but medium (or smaller) wrists.  Thankfully, the battery only makes this a weekly inconvenience.So where does it all fall apart?  The app.  I’m not talking about what I perceive as some of the early “teething problems” (e.g., you want to look at daily results, but after each view it resets you back to weekly, causing you to do it all over again the next time) which I expect will be resolved over time.  I’m talking about the fundamental concept/method that they have chosen for scoring which is frustrating beyond belief.First off, they don’t give you distance traveled.  Annoying, but at least I see steps.  As mentioned in other reviews, there are questions around accuracy, as well as relative treatment/weighting of certain categories of activity, sleep, etc., but I can live with all that.Here’s the biggie: their handling (and basically insinuations) around “sedentary” and the scoring related to it.  This will be a problem for many, but especially those who have a job while locked down during CoVid.  You can work your hindquarters off, but if (like I do; I work in tech) you have a job that requires you to do 8, 10, 12 or however many hours of Zoom, Teams calls, and/or banging away at a keyboard, there is nothing more frustrating than watching all your hard work in the morning at the gym being consumed by DOING YOUR JOB.  I’ve been a tech early adopter since the 80s, and I can recall nothing more demotivating (therefore, counterproductive) than this app when it comes to well-being.I have NO IDEA why Amazon chose a scoring methodology with negative reinforcement, ironically at a time where encouragement is needed for many.  It’s an easy fix: just make point scoring for positive activities a little more difficult and disable the sedentary subtractions (btw, please don’t think I’m advocating for being more sedentary!).  Even simpler: again, keep tracking sedentary but don’t give penalties, just set daily/weekly targets higher.In my case, I have just stopped paying attention to the Activity portion of the app.  Ignore it completely, no matter how high or low my score, and rely on a regimen I’ve set to work out when I’m not working.  I now use the Halo Band for sleep monitoring and tracking other health-related topics like heart rate... and love it for this.  But it is such a waste.Going forward, I’m hoping Amazon will have the sense to remove punitive features of the app/band combo.  It’s a really great product saddled with a demoralizing app, yet it still has the chance to be a game-changer.  I have now dumped all my smart watches (yes, I had several), and will never go back.  I’ve already begun a search for a similar product with a more motivating app approach, just in case Amazon maintains its course here.Fingers crossed, either way :)",3
42,"I have been working out for 40 years.  I consider myself very active.  I routinely get 15-20k steps per day, spin almost daily, and lift weights at the gym 4-5 days each week.  But, I had no idea I could vastly improve my athleticism, health, and aesthetics from a little device on my wrist.When I first received the Halo Band and set it, which was super simple, I delved into the point system criteria.  Interesting approach to say the least.  150 points.  Ok.  Let's put it to the test.  Starting fresh on a Saturday I went about my normal routine.  By the end of the day, I was at around 135 points.  Challenge accepted.  My goal was 150 points the next day.  Then I read some more and saw that it was 150 minimum for the week.  Dang.  Either way.  I was still challenging myself to get to 150 each day.  I have now lowered my bar to anywhere within 100-150 points ( although on some days I hit close to 200 ) but I get 100/day minimum or I don't go to bed.How this little device has improved my life is in a few distinct ways.  I love a challenge and pushing my body harder.  Our bodies are so much stronger than we think.  The point system does just that.  3 simple metrics:  Intense, moderate, and light.  The genius concept in its simplicity.The sedentary measure.  Sure, I was hitting 20k steps and always on the go but yet on some days I was at 8 hours sedentary.  Sitting in the office, standing, talking to coworkers, driving, and eating.....all add up.  No more.  The new me will be well under 8 each day unless I REALLY need some rest.  Sleep monitoring is really good.  About the same as most other biometric devices.  The clincher and component that sold me was body analytics.  As a benchmark, I did a body scan within the first few days.  13%.  Sounded about right.  As this little device pushed me to ride a little longer, move more often and even watch my caloric intake more, I am now at 10% and feel amazing.  I was down to 9% but it was difficult to sustain.About me, I am 52 ( I know, I look 51 ), 5'10"", and now weigh 153-154 pounds.  My resting heart rate is often times in the upper 40s.  Trying to sound as modest as possible, I feel I am now in the best health/shape of my life.  Not entirely owed to the Halo Band but it pushed me and helped me achieve that little extra oomph to get me here.  I think if you personally challenge yourself then this device will work great for you as well.  If you get frustrated at not seeing high numbers in the App then your level of success will be much less.It is also extremely comfortable, has excellent battery life ( 5-7 days with no tone mode on ) and the lack of display is very refreshing.  Lots of band options to match your attire, although I do wish there were a few more fabric band choices but not a deal-breaker at all.Just my personal opinion but I do like it.",5
43,I have owned three Fitbits and all three are not working properly.  The last fit bit I bought was the alta 2 but the heart rate monitor stopped working.  The heart rate monitor also stopped working in my first alta and the fit bit kids tracker just stopped working entirely.  My Amazon Halo seems more durable.  I prefer not to see the display.  I have had it for a year and the heart rate monitor still works.  I like the sleep tracker better on this app and overall I like the app a lot.  I also prefer the textile band on the Halo to the rubber/plastic band that comes standard on fit bit.  You can buy non-textile bands for the Halo if you want but the plasticky band on my last fit bit got greasy and kept coming unbuckled as a result.  It was very annoying to constantly rebuckle it.  I have also bought some spare textile bands for my Halo and I love the colors.  I wish the Halo app had a menstrual flow tracker in the app (like fit bit) but that is my only complaint.,5
44,"I was lucky enough to get an early invite for the Halo and was so excited, I love Amazon tech.  I was one of the first to get the original Echo, I enjoy the Luna, I actually even really like the Echo clock. Then came the Halo.... ( I hope I still will get early access invites after this review.)Lets start with the positives, it measures steps, sleep patterns, heart rate, blood pressure... Basically everything we have come to expect from a fitness tracker.  It will also, for a monthly fee, give you access to additional features such as measuring the tone of your voice or giving you a 3D model of your BMI.  (As long as you upload photos of yourself in your underwear.)The down side is huge, there is no screen.  I knew when I purchased the Halo, that it didn't have a screen so I was not surprised.  What surprised me was that after using it how much I wanted a screen.Please, I have seen the other reviews about how great it is not having a screen.  So before you contact me and tell me that it is nice not having a screen, or why do you need a screen?  I have one question for you.... ""What time is it?""  ....Oh, you have to take out your phone to check the time?  Or look at your watch?  Or you look at your other fitness band?Not having a screen is the Halo's downfall.  If I want to check my steps, I need my phone, if I want to check the time I need my phone.  I don't just need my phone, I need to take it out and use it.  My phone also does a good job at counting my steps and telling the time. So why Halo? I found myself wearing a normal fitness tracker as well as the Halo, just because there are times that I wanted the ease of seeing my steps and the time at a glance instead of having to take out my phone.As for the other apps that you get with Halo, apps that you pay a fee for, you can get these apps on your phone.  The same phone that you need if you want to use any feature of the Halo.The second most disappointing feature of the Halo is the battery life.  If you make use of Halo's Tone analyzer, you get ""up to two days of battery life.""  Wow up to two whole days....  This is a joke.  With ""Tone"" on, I get about a day.  My Halo spends more time on a charger than my wrist.I currently wear a $20 Wyze Band.  This is a budget fitness tracker, I am not a fitness tracker snob.  It has all of the basic features of the Halo (the features you don't have to pay for monthly) yet I don't need my phone all the time.I love Amazon tech, but the Halo misses the mark.I wanted to update my review, Amazon reached out and wanted to know why I didn't like the Halo.  Below is my response.Hello,Thank you for reaching out.  I received a Halo with a defective charger.  It appeared to be some extra plastic in the charger that covered one of the charging pins.  I contacted support and was told to return the item.  I was not offered a replacement, just a refund.  At the time I was excited to try the Halo and didn't want to return it, I wanted to try it, so I attempted to fix the issue.  After scraping away the extra plastic I was finally able to get the Halo to charge.  This is where I found problems with the product.First, I noticed that the Halo is very, very inaccurate with the step counting.  Whenever I buy a fitness tracker, I keep my old one just to see how close they are.  I didn't even need to do this with the Halo to see how off it was.  I would wake up each morning, with hundreds and at times thousands of steps.  Unless I powerwalk in my sleep, I should never wake up with almost 2000 steps.Second, the battery life is awful.  If you use the ""Tone"" feature, the battery maybe lasts a day.  So if you use the ""Tone"" during the day and if it lasts until you go to sleep, you can charge it overnight.  However, that cancels out the sleep tracking feature because it is on the charger.  So now I have to decide which features I want to use and which I can't use because the battery is awful.Third, there is no screen.  Why isn't there one?  If I wear the Halo, I need to wear a watch, keep checking my phone, or wear another fitness tracker if I want to see what time it is.  If I want to see my steps, I need to pull out my phone.  My phone already counts my steps.  If I want to know the time, I need my phone.  My phone doesn't track my sleep; however, nor does the Halo because the battery lasts only a few hours.I really wish the Halo was better.  I love Amazon tech, but this is awful.  Maybe I got a defective unit, I hope I did, but I will be returning it.",2
45,"I've worn this non stop for about year and a half (got through a preview program).I actively do martial arts 3-5 times a week, and when gyms were closed used a lot of programs in the app to do guided exercises.The hardware is holding up really well. I am 6'2"", 220lbs, wear it on my wrist and only take it off when doing BJJ or other form of grappling (to reduce risk of injuring my opponents). I take showers, baths and hottubs with it, swam in oceans, did water sports, shooting, stick fighting, mountain biking - I never notice it's there. I've never specifically washed the device or band, they basically take care of themselves and look great. The default fabric band only starts showing signs of wear now. Charger works fine and a single charge lasts about a week for me.I like the sleep tracking feature - it captures sleep cycles well and provides good info.Activity tracker is ok - it captures activities and heart zones, and gives me my points more or less accurately. I'd like there to be more analytics embedded into this portion - presently there's no way to see avg hr for workout, drill down into zones on a per minute basis, view HRV stats, or even edit autocaptured activities. There's a lot that can be done here. Seems like lots of missed opportunities given the sophisticated HR sensor (compare to what Whoop does).Body tracker is a nice gimmick and I like the body fat composition measurer. At some point I was actively working to drop my weight from 250 to 220, this thing was rather accurate.I turned off voice tracker in the beginning. The value was nonexistent for me. I know how I sound throughout the day and the band confirmed that. The information it gives you is not actionable, but it drains the battery faster, and despite all assurances, you never really know where this data is going, who's using it, and when due to some bug or breach or whatever recorded copies of your conversations will be on the web.The guided programs were a big hit for me, especially when the gyms were closed during early pandemic. I hate coming up with my own exercise routines and there is a decent variety. The content itself is hit and miss. Some are well structured, some are just recorded studio sessions not optimized for this kind of consumption. There were a few completely silent. For some reason the app gets in the way a lot. The video player is proprietary, so it doesn't support system controls like casting, easy rewinding, subtitles, etc, and it's just not as snappy as the system player.But here comes the kicker - when my trial year of membership ran out, I discovered that you can't just renew from the Halo app or Amazon app! I spent quite a lot of time digging around menus, trying to find it among my subscriptions - it's just not there! I ended up finding the membership when accessing through a desktop web browser and then it turns out it uses yet another system than Prime and others, and for some reason stopped accepting my payment method. In the end I didn't have the steam in me to talk to support about being unable to renew a freaking membership (just take my money dammit!) and ordered a Whoop.Thanks Amazon, maybe I'll try again in the future if you figure out getting membership renewed in two clicks on a mobile app.",4
46,"I ordered this device prior to its release by invitation and had high hopes for it based on the promised specs. In fact, I kept it for a while longer than I should have because I really wanted it to work so much, but in the end, it didn't live up to what was promised. As a step tracker, it's okay, but the rest of the functionality was spotty at best. I'll break down my thoughts by category below:Voice recognition - while this seemed like a novel and interesting functionality, and one of the main reasons I bought the Halo, it fell way short of expectation. In most days, it captured a total of 5-7 tone recognitions even though I wore the device all day. Although it was a cool thing to see that I was ""optimistic"" at 9:02 am and ""sad"" at 12:10 pm, I had no way to correspond this information to any usable metrics. I don't recall my conversations from 2 hours before. And 5 little snapshots a day doesn't tell me anything about what was being said or my overall mood, so I can't make improvements based on the stats derived from those minimal points (20% of my day was sad because 1 of 5 points was sad; that isn't a large sampling). I never tried the function to analyze specific conversations, but my goal here was to improve my correspondence with everyday people and in typical interactions, so that function really wasn't useful to me.Software - if I were someone who used a lot of the subscription software they have for the monthly fee, this would've been a good value for me, but I have my own workout programming, and my family uses Headspace already, so this part didn't entice me. I liked the idea of seeing progress on sleep and mood while using the paid software, but this would rely on the Halo being accurate, and it wasn't (we'll get to that). The Halo app itself was easy enough to navigate, but it didn't offer much outside this programming--a points system based off a needed number of points a week for health (too easy to achieve even for someone who only works out 3 hours a week), and metrics that really didn't offer much in recommendations for improvements. The standards like heartrate and steps were there, but the software didn't do much with that information and didn't offer much by way of challenges as my past fitness devices have (Fitbit, Samsung, and Garmin).Accuracy - This device fell way short in this area. I purchased a sport band, which was impressively comfortable. I wore it properly (I've been using devices for years, so I have that down). But it often didn't register my weight training workouts as anything but light to no activity, despite HIIT training components interspersed and an elevated heart rate, and its sleep tracking was inaccurate, marking me as in light asleep at points in the middle of the night when I was up and moving around.Sleep - The charts for this were great to look at and get a general idea of deep/REM/light sleep phases. This would be great actionable information if the device were accurate, as too little or too much sleep in one area or another greatly impacts mood and health, and could indicate underlying health issues (like apnea or depression). As noted above, though, the device wasn't as accurate as I would have expected, so as much as I loved the idea of tracking that information, it was again, useless.Body measurements - the device claims to be one of the most accurate on the market and works by having you stand still and take pictures of yourself at all angles (which takes several minutes). It then analyzes your body fat composition, then gives you a toggle bar that will show you what you will look like at certain fat percentages below where you are. While this was a neat function in some ways, it turns out the device came up with the same fat percentage as my scale. Glad to confirm my scale's reliability, I guess, and great the two match each other, but I don't see myself taking several minutes out of my day regularly to do something that my scale does in seconds. As to the photos showing where I'll be, it's a nice way to encourage people, but as I've been at the lower fat percentages previously that the toggle shows me, I can also gauge easily that this function was also inaccurate. I don't lose fat as proportionally as the software thinks.Form - the device is light and easy to wear. I forgot that I had it on most days, but I did find the original band rough and annoying, so I purchased a sport band and only used that. Design is a matter of preference, so I won't analyze the band for fashion. It fit well. It was comfortable. Good enough. The charger, however, was a pain to use. It was tricky to get it snapped in just right and about 1/3 of the time, it didn't register properly even when the contact points were lined up. This could be user error, but I expect charging devices to be easier than this clip design allows.Overall - the Halo promises more than it delivers, which makes it not worth my time or money. That said, I do love what it's trying to do, creating a whole health approach for mental and physical well-being, so I'll be watching it closely to see if it gets there. If it does, I'll definitely be back on board.",2
47,"As a 50yr old out of shape geek and father, I was excited to buy myself a Halo for Christmas. I know the competition for ""wrist fitness"" is huge, so the Halo's unique features like tone and body tracking were the winner for me. Step and activity tracking is baseline at this point, as is sleep tracking. Lots of things do that.  And if I spent the money and only got those two things, at this price point, I'd call it ""good enough"". But the selling point is the unique features, and they're just not ready for prime time.For the tone thing, it's supposed to listen to you talk throughout the day and give you pointers about when you're being positive or negative. As a husband and father I'm interested in that, I'd like to know how other people perceive my tone of voice. The first thing that happens when you enable the feature is it tells you ""This is going to kill your battery.""  Great. Thanks for making one of your signature features something that starts with ""Are you sure you want to enable this?"" Technically you can turn it on and off on demand with the one physical button on the side, but who is going to remember to do that? Wait, hang on, I feel an argument with my wife coming on, let me record it for posterity. No.The problem with this feature is that it's useless. Know what you get? You get ""moments"" like ""a few hours ago you used a phrase that could be considered frustrated or disappointed."" ... and? When it's 11:45am and I supposed to remember exactly what I was saying at 8:15? There's no recording or anything, no transcription, no clue what the phrase was.  A steady stream of those throughout the day is just noise, if there's not enough evidence to do anything about it.  There is a live mode, where a dot on the screen does a kind of green/red thing as you talk, which is the most interesting feature. I can only imagine what that does to your battery. What would be great here is a little vibraty notification on the device itself when you go negative. Some sort of subtle reminder that hey, maybe your tone isn't what you want at the moment.  That would be so much more useful than hours later being told you did something wrong.  I ended up turning it off.Then there's the body tracking thing, where you take pictures of yourself and it does some magic to estimate things like body fat percentage.  I know there's all kinds of privacy concerns about this feature written elsewhere so I won't get into that here.  Let's just sum up how it works. It wants you to get nearly naked, set your phone up with the camera on, then stand maybe 8-10feet away and get into the poses it tells you.  There's audio feedback, which makes sense since you're not touching the phone and you're 10ft away from it, but standing there in your underwear while your phone says ""spread your feet apart. wider. lift your left arm."" is more than a little creepy. If you live in a house with other people, good luck finding a time and place where you're comfortable doing this.  When it works (it took me 3-4 tries, crashing or rebooting my phone), it does give interesting, if depressing, results. If you already feel bad about yourself, looking at pictures of your nearly naked body isn't going to do much for your self esteem, be warned. But I knew what I was getting into.My biggest problem with this feature is that you go through all that trouble, then it tells you it'll set a notification to do it again in 2 weeks.  I realize that seeing actual physical changes in your body is not going to happen daily, but here's another signature feature of the device that you're going to use for about 5 minutes every 2 weeks.  I get on the scale every day. Sometimes it goes up a little, sometimes down a little, but at least I get feedback and a general trend. Speaking of which, there's not even a reasonable weight tracker in this thing - it only tracks by the pound, not fractions of a pound, and uses a dropdown widget to do it! Again, it's the subtle UI things -- defaulting weight to 120 and making somebody scroll up to 220 is not very body positive.The activity and sleep trackers are fine. One thing I like is that while tracking activity points it actually counts ""sedentary"" time against you - you get negative points. That alone would encourage me to get up and move ... if I knew it was happening. Again, great opportunity here for a little rumble on the wrist.  Nope. Not even an option for a notification on my phone. Just figuring out, possibly hours later, ""you weren't active enough earlier today.""I find the mobile app slow and clunky, but I figure that can get better with updates. Half the time I can't figure out how to find the data I want and I'm not sure if it's in there somewhere and I'm missing it, or it's just not there.Overall the new tech ideas are interesting, but not well implemented. Something as simple as vibration feedback in the device would be a huge leap forward.  I'm glad I got it early at the better price, because for day to day use it's basically just an activity / sleep tracker.",2
48,"I requested into the Halo program when it was first announced. I was a 3 year FitBit user and the 3 I hate would break either physically or by software update the same time each year (around May/June) so I gave them up. I got this band back in October. Here is my review of having it for almost 2 months:Band: Sometimes I forget it doesn't have a screen and I will check it for the time (lol) but otherwise it fits break! I feels comfortable and honestly I hardly notice its on. Probably why sometimes I don't notice when I leave the house without it. The FitBits (charge 2 and 3) would leave marks on my wrist and would irriate it, but not this one!App: The app is good and intuitive. The main for areas: sleep, activity, tone, and body scan are there to view. The labs are awesome! I have especially gotten into the Headspace mindfulness programs!Activity/Workouts: The activities are good as well. I had a subscription to BeachBodyOnDemand but with the demands of my job I can't commit to work out 6-7 days a week so this is great as There are single workouts and programs that last from 1-4 weeks and commit you to working out 2-4 days a week which is much more manageable. I like that it emphasis activity points which makes it more fun for me than just step goals. It will track steps as well and I've read some people say the tracker is off but honestly I think my charge 2 and 3 were not accurate either. The Halo is about in line with what my Fitbit was tracking for me.Sleep: it detects sleep at night during normal night time hours but won't really detect naps. At least that is what I've noticed. I think an update has fixed it but I have not noticed it. It seems accurate and again its in line with what my fitbit was recording last year when I used it. The sleep labs are good, I've mainly just used the night-time sounds ones to fall asleep but I did do the PMR one and that was helpful!Body Scan: So the body scan is actually pretty cool! it asks you to wear minimal clothes and tight fitting to get an accurate scan. I wear athletic shorts and no shirt for mine. it recommends do one every 2 weeks. you have to prop your phone up so the front camera is facing you and it prompts you on how far to stand away from it and when to turn. it takes pictures of your front, back, and both sides. Not sure how accurate the % body fat is but its informative which is what I am looking for. I am currently dieting on nutrisystem and working out 3/4 days a week and I've seen my body fat % drop each time I do a scan every 2 weeks.Tone: The tone function is interesting. This is a battery drainer so if you want your band to last 5-6 days then don't use it! if you do, you will be charging the band every 2 days on average. I don't mind it as I work from home so I can plug mine in anytime to charge. The setup is easy, it will record you saying a few phrases in your normal voice to get a baseline. Then, it will periodically turn the mic on to listen to you as you talk. The app will tell you if you sound happy, sad, depressed, angry, etc and give you a graph that shows how you sounded that day. Mostly I sound neutral but I have noticed over the last week I am getting more happy with my tone so I think being aware of it is really helping!Overall I am very happy with it! No complaints. If you are concerning buy it, just keep in mine this is Amazon's first journey into this. FitBit and others have been doing this awhile so don't expect it to be like the Apple Watch or FitBit. But it definitely see the improvement in it and I think it has great potential!",5
49,"I bought this on a whim when they had a sale last summer (2021). I thought the concept was interesting, calculating effort rather than steps/miles. There are some things I really like and some things that could use some tweaking.Pros:Points - I love that you have a set number of points per day/week to achieve your goals. Points are earned through the effort of your 'workout' or daily movements. I like this much better than steps as I get close to 8,000-10,000 steps a day, but it doesn't help my overall fitness. I also love that the points change each day/week depending on how well you did on your previous goal. You can also set your own goal.Steps/Calories - Like other apps/watches, this calculates your step and calories. I find it consistent with other watches.Sleep - I LOVE this. Amazon's calculation of my sleep was much more consistent and precise than other watches I've used.Insights- these are small tidbits of advice to help you better your goals.Activity - I love that it picks up on my walking and running activity. I find it fairly accurate. I can also do I ""live"" tracking of an activity.Extras - I also love that there are workouts and recipes, though I haven't used them as often.Water Resistant/Proof - From working in the garden to SUP, I can wear this watch and it will calculate my efforts.Cons -Check-Ins - because there is no screen on the watch, I often don't use the app and check how I'm doing. In order to check your stats, you have to log into the app. A suggestion for Amazon would be to create a widget for the app so you can quickly see your stats on your phone screen.""Live"" - you can track your activity as you do it. The Downside is that it sometimes pauses if you open another app. However, I have found this with other apps and watches as well.Wear and Tear - I got the light pink wristband in hopes it would blend in better. However, because the bands are made of fabric, they get VERY dirty VERY quickly.Other:Tone - This I could without. It's neither a positive or a negative. If you don't set it to a schedule it will kill the battery of your watch. It is cool to see how your tone was during certain times of day. I often reflect on it but then wonder what I was saying. It doesn't record your actual conversation (which is both a positive and a negative).Body - this calculates your body composition through an image. I think it's super cool! I haven't used it a ton but it is interesting to see where I land on the Body Fat % compared to my weight, knowing all well that this data isn't what determines your health all the time.Band - the band itself is super comfy. It easily goes on and off secured with velcro. It is also easily adjustable.Overall, I love the idea of this tracker. I think the biggest thing would be to have a widget on the phone screen to quickly show updates of stats. If it had that, I would have given it 5 stars.",4
50,"EDITED: I gave this product an extra star and added some things to this review. Apparently this team is dedicated to making it better and reached out to me about my review (which is impressive and shows they care), so that says to me eventually this product will get better.I really, really wanted to like this... knowing a huge company like Amazon would be pushing to have a competitive fitness tracker got my hopes up. I was part of the invitation beta group that tried it before it went public.Sadly, this tracker falls too short from what I’m looking for. I think my issue is I want it to be a fitness tracker, but it’s just a mediocre, general health tracker.CONS:-The voice analyzer for me is ridiculous. Not only is it a huge battery suck, and no one really asked for it, it’s an unnecessary part of a fitness tracker that’s taking up space on it and the app itself.-The app needs a big overhaul. Let us customize the tiles and what we’re needing. Amazon has enough money to make this product amaze-balls but isn’t following through. It doesn’t have HRV analysis, sleeping analysis isn’t accurate and doesn’t track naps during the day, it uses some lame “points” system for fitness, to see your calories burned you have to dig for it in the app.-The calories burned is waaaay inaccurate. Enough to push me away. The whole reason I need a fitness tracker is to know where I stand in my training, and it serves no use if it's inaccurate. No way I burned 3,000 calories sitting on my ass on a Sunday all day with the BMR that I know. I tested it out the night before I decided to end my membership - no way I burned 670 calories from a 3.5 mile jog at a 5mph pace.-The charger clip is a little annoying. Not entirely bad, but can be frustrating sometimes to get it to charge. It's not a plug-in USB or a slip-on like Whoop's - it's a clip and can have issues connecting. Not a complete deterrent though. If you like this product enough, you'll probably forget about this small issue.PROS:-This tracker is trying hard to be a little of everything to appease everyone, but honestly it’s probably best for people just starting to exercise and don’t want to bother knowing exact calories, recovery, or HRV - just a rough idea of how they’re doing with Halo’s weird points system.-The body-fat scanner is pretty cool, I’ll admit. No other tracker has this feature, as far as I know. I haven’t had issues like other reviews, as mine have been pretty accurate. The 3D scans of your body are saved, and it’s nice to see any changes in your body from those scans.-It’s comfortable enough that I forget I’m wearing it, and it doesn’t snag off my wrist like the Whoop. I'd have to say it's the most comfortable of the trackers I've tried. I like that it doesn’t have a screen, and most athletes I know prefer not having a screen to avoid damage and getting rough with it when needed. We’re always on our phones anyways, so why need more breakable screens on your wrists, so I don't understand the complaints from people needing a screen on something you're getting aggressive with.-For people who don't know what exercises to do, or just need a quick workout without digging through the web or YouTube, the labs portion of the app is nifty. Just click on a video from the app and you can follow along immediately, something the other fitness trackers don't have.-It’s cheap for the subscription. It’s biggest competitor for me is the Whoop, which is $30/month, so the Halo’s subscription is a steal for me. Though I still don’t feel with what the Halo offers is subscription worthy, especially if you're not using the voice analyzer. Maybe I'll keep it around just for the scans...However, in the end, I feel you kind of get what you pay for. When this tracker gets the necessary updates I might come back, and I’m hoping it gets better versions in the future, but for now, looks like I’m going back to the pricier Whoop. Amazon needs to step up their game, and they have the power to be the best tracker - they’re just not doing it yet.",3
51,"Let me just start by saying this one device has completely put me off influencer promoted products.At this price, not to even mention the monthly fee, it's very difficult to understand who this is actually made for. I used this thing for several months straight, so please let me explain:To begin, the band has no screen which I suppose is a feature(?) but if you wear a watch, then you are forced to put this thing on your off arm, basically turning you into some kind of weird bracleted mess. Admittedly, this won't be everyone's issue, but for me...I have a hard time trying not to crack the screen on one wristbound device, so its something that will absolutely be an issue for some.That said, the actual device feels fairly robust, but as you can see in the pictures, it is weirdly sized...very narrow and tall. Apparently it's also meant to be worn slightly above the wrist, which is not something that feels natural to me, no matter how long I wore it for. Eventually, I moved it back to where I would normally wear a watch and moved it to my off hand, which I can confirm did not affect its function in any way I could discern.Back to the headline, though. I have owned, used and enjoyed (mostly) several gens of Apple watches, the Whoop band, more android watches than I would care to admit in public and several generations of the garmin fenix. If you have or where trying to decide between this and ANY OF THOSE...go with the other option.Let's start with the sleep tracking. It is not accurate. At all. I was so surprised that I was only getting three to four hours on average with this band on that I eventually ended up comparing it to the results found on my other watches. IMO, the Garmin line has provided the most accurate picture of my sleep and recovery and when compared to the Halo, it almost always didn't jive. The results were so surprising to me, that in my madness I spent almost a week wearing my garmin fenix 5, halo band and a whoop band and two of those three were in agreement about my sleep habits. Even things as simple as movement during sleep, REM and recovery were wildly off. I fully acknowledge that every company has their own way of doing things, but c'mon, son...Now, let's talk about fitness tracking. You know what happens when you don't have a screen or accurate auto tracking for a workout? You end up adding an extra five minute trying to get to the actual setting within the app (yeah, gotta have your phone to play this game) and then remember to go back in and turn it off when you're done.Let me just say, if you are looking at this for fitness tracking, keep scrolling. The friction this caused me just trying to initiate workouts early in the AM when I'm usually warming up for my runs was infuriating.Speaking of which...let's talk about that app. Very pretty...easy to navigate, though bloated and cumbersome. Wholly unuseful. Do you own a fire TV device? Wouldn't you want to cast those cool in-app programs to your screen?Yeah, you can't do that.So, again, you are tethered to your phone. I realize many like to have their phone near at hand, but how many people enjoy fiddling with their phone when they're, say, trying to meditate? How about having to whip out the app to start the ""sleep program""? IDK what this ""Auto Tracked"" actually refers to, but let me save you some suspense...the only apparent thing it tracks automatically is what you're doing...after you've initiated the activity though the app. It takes roughly three taps after launching the app to even begin these activities, so again the question about wanting to fiddle with this before bed becomes salient.And the battery life...two days with ""Live"" monitoring on is not accurate. And even if it were, I cannot imagine anyone wanting to have to charge this thing so frequently when you have to take the device off and it takes FOREVER to charge that tiny battery. The Whoop band has got it beat here in spades. Not only can you keep the device on while it's charging, the charger is also a battery so you don't actually need to be tethered to a wall outlet to use it.So, what are you really left with? Not a whole lot.The app is passable (and pretty) and I found that the body scan is very accurate as I get weekly InBody scans and for the most part the fat/muscle percentages are within about a percentage point or two. I feel like there are free or buy once apps that can do similarly and for me at least, does not justify the monthly cost.If you've made it this far, then let me summarize by saying that this is a very fancy step counter that, in my opinion needs a lot more development, particularly with how people actually use fitness devices in the real world. If you have a step counter on your phone, or have a smart watch, then this isn't for you.Let me just say it again, if you take your phone with you to work out, if you own a smartwatch or even a simple pedometer, then it is really hard to say that this is a device for you. TBPH, I don't know who this device is for other than instagram influencers, but this has been my unfettered, unsolicited take on this thing that I literally just cancelled.If amazon is reading this, just promote the app. I feel like your time spent on developing that was better spent than in developing this device.",1
52,"This will be a lengthy review of all of Halo's features.I wanted to like this so badly, but after ~3 months of use I can safely say I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. If you want a fitness tracker, just get a fitbit. The Halo is still on my wrist simply because I paid for it and I'm stubborn.I have no idea how accurate the body fat calculator is (which requires a body scan) but it said my body fat was about 50% higher than what my smart scale says. So if you want to be discouraged about your weight moreso than you already are, go ahead and do a body scan. I also accidentally deleted the body scan as soon as I completed it because there was no confirmation dialog asking me if I really wanted to delete the scan. I was too discouraged to strip back down and do another after that. Its possible this is an accurate body fat reading, but it would be the only reading the Halo band does accurately.It does not track my steps correctly. Fitbit and my phone always get a higher step count.Sleep tracking leaves much to be desired. If the band is not tight enough to cut off circulation to your hand, it will likely shift during your sleep and you'll get a wildly inaccurate sleep stage reading or no sleep score will generate for you at all. It also says it only logs ""awake"" time throughout your night if you were awake for longer than 30 minutes. This is false. My band logs me waking up for 30+ minutes multiple times a night, almost every single night. I know I do not wake up in the middle of the night so this is terribly inaccurate. Also, no matter how long and how well I sleep, I have NEVER gotten a ""great"" sleep score. It makes you second guess if you are really that bad at sleeping or if the band is faulty. I lean towards the latter.The activity points are a joke and inaccurate as well. It says you should get 2 points for each 1 min of movement if your workout is intense. No idea what they really use as the threshold for ""intense"" workouts (cause it doesn't seem to be based off heart rate like the app says) but I worked out for an hour and a half, sweating and high heart rate nearly the whole time, and it only logged 30 points of light activity. Also if you go over the 8hr sedentary time each day, it will start removing activity points from your day. I think it tracks your sleep as part of your sedentary time and I also work from home on a computer all day, so I'm constantly getting activity points reduced even if I do an intense workout in the evening (which it doesn't track properly). So essentially I have a band telling me I work too much to ever be healthy. It's pretty discouraging. Would really not recommend this product to anyone who works on a computer 40+ hrs a week.The app is finicky and and syncing with the band is unreliable. Tried syncing the app with my band 4 times this morning but none of the data would populate. Will try again tomorrow....As for the tone readings, I suppose they are probably accurate but it does not tell you what you said, just what time it was said and how you came off. It also doesn't update in real time, so you may not get your tone results until the next day. You've probably forgotten exactly what you said at that point and can't learn from the results. Besides, do you really want a band that tells you how negative you are all the time? Are you really willing to change because a band thought you sounded frustrated? Again, I work from home and rarely talk to anyone. When I do, it's to fix something, so of course my watch tells me that every word I said that day came off demanding, frustrated or anxious. There's not much I can do to change that so now I just have a watch to remind me how frustrating working can be! Ha! The live tone feature may be more useful so you can record exact conversations and get results for that conversation, but the ongoing voice feature leaves much to be desired. It also DRAINS the battery life requiring you to charge the band every other day. And while it's charging, you're getting dinged for sedentary time!The labs? Meh. There are good ideas for a healthier lifestyle, but it's 100% on you to follow through with them and log them. There aren't any notifications that pop up to remind you to eat that apple every day or to do your 5 minute yoga. You need to hold yourself accountable to do the labs you find interesting on the app and go back to the app each day to log if you did it or not. Also, the workout routines/meditation tracks they give you with your monthly subscription is the same kind of stuff you could find on YouTube for free.Overall, don't bother. Just get a different fitness band. This falls short in every aspect. The data it gathers over time would be awesome to have if I could trust any of it to be accurate, which I don't.",2
53,"I've had this device now for several months, have been using the app, and trying the functionality to see what I like and what I don't.  So, here is my take:Positives:1. I saw someone post that this device is extremely large compared to their Apple watch.  Um... that is objectively an untrue statement.  I have worn Fitbit and Samsung watches, among other devices and this device is the most comfortable of all of them.  The band is really easy to remove and clean, or just change.  I really like the soft woven band due to its comfort.  Although, that band does get dirty pretty quickly so I have a couple of extras so I can replace it while I clean it.2. The battery lasts forever compared to my other devices.  I can wear it for 3 days without charging, and that is awesome!  Full disclosure, I do not use the tone tracking anymore and turning that off really increased my battery time.3. The sleep, HR, and activity tracking work well.  They seem to be reliable and valid (read, consistent and accurate).  The focus on goals is really helpful to me for keeping me motivated to move and to build good sleep habits.4. I really like the app.  They are obviously science-based and evidence-based in their approach to goal setting and improving health.  The app may not be all you need to develop good habits, but I would hardly expect this company to do the work of habit building for you.Gaps:1. I really wish that I could get a band that looks like a bracelet so that I could continue wearing the device even when dressed up.  I mean, I obviously can physically wear it when dressed up, but it sort of detracts from a nice outfit with either the soft woven band or the silicone band.  That is something I would like to see.2. The tone tracker constantly reported that I was coming across as either 'neutral' or 'angry.'  Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty animated, but most of the people I interact with tell me that they think I'm really nice and don't know why I say that I'm so mean.  Who knows, maybe the tone tracker is right and I just sound angry all the time.  On the other hand, it could be an issue with the variety of voices in the world (particularly female voices) and the results could be inaccurate because I have a very firm and solid voice.  You, dear reader, can decide for yourself.  You don't know me, so I guess you'll just have to go with your gut on this one.  Maybe other reviewers can shed light.3. I think it would be really helpful for the device to have a vibrate function that you could set to notify you in real-time when some condition is met.  For example, a quick vibration when you meet your step goal.  Or, maybe a quick vibration to alert you that you sound angry.  I realize that this would run the risk of reducing battery life, but I think the benefit could outweigh the disadvantage there.Overall, if you aren't looking to have a timepiece on your wrist and you don't need to make phone calls from your wrist, then I think the halo is a good choice.",4
54,"I've been wearing Halo for almost a month now and I really wanted to like it, but sadly its really nothing more then a glorified heart rate monitor. I already wear an Apple Watch and was looking for something that would provide me deeper insight. But knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it. I got it for $65, but at $100 its really overpriced. Most I'd pay for this is $40 or $50. For a company like Amazon to just now enter the wearables market, this is definitely a miss much more then a hit. They've had a long time to get this right.I'm ok with the fact that Halo doesn't have a screen. But since it doesn't have a screen, the only way to interact with it is via the app. But there is nothing to pull me into the app.  I get zero notifications from Halo expect for literally ""Low Battery"". There are no motivation, data, etc notifications telling me how I'm doing or how I can improve. Since you have to use the app to see data, during workouts, there is no way to check my progress or anything similar.Furthermore, the app is too busy and convoluted. Data and metrics are not served up will in a way that actually makes them useful. Things like ""Labs"" are buried and generally not relevant to me, the user. Example, I keep getting ""Help your kids fall asleep with a meditation"" as a ""Related Labs"" in sleep. Only problem is I'm a mid-30's single man with no kids. When you dive deeper into the data, you can only see how your data was for that day related to the days of the week. You can't dive deeper and see what your heart rate did during your workout or something else.Each feature in the Halo app feels like its a standalone product and seems they don't talk to each other.  The app has 4 different ""features"" if you will. Activity, Sleep, Tone, and Body.Activity uses a ""points"" based system and while they tell you how you can earn points. You get 1 point for both light and moderate activity and then 2 points for ""intense' activity and then they take away points for what they call ""Sedentary Time"".  But due to the above mentioned lack of feedback from the app, how you earn them seems to be a bit elusive. Also they put ""Grocery shopping and walking around the office"" as light activity, and then ""Brisk walking and cycling"" as Moderate, with ""Running and shoveling snow"" as Intense. They also state that Moderate is 50-70% of your ""Maximum predicted heart rate"" with Intense at ""at least 70% of your Maximum predicted heart rate"".Sleep Tracking with Halo compared to my Apple Watch seems just absolutely basic. I've had nights of just crappy sleep (not only do I wake up not feeling refreshed, the data my Apple Watch serves shows why), where as Halo calls it a ""Good or Great Night"". But with Halo its hard to tell why you didn't sleep well or what might have gone wrong that night. They even say ""But sleep is complicated, and numbers don't always tell the full story. So trust your body."" I mean, I get that, but if that's true, why do I even have this device?With ""Body"" (Scans), the ones I have taken so far are horribly inaccurate. At my height and weight, I would have to be either horribly obese or have zero muscle tone to have the percentage of fat that Body Scan says I have. If it was just one that was wrong, I might be able to write it off. But all of mine have been this way. Not to mention, as other reviews have said, this (and Tone) can be dangerous features. These ""Body"" scans could cause someone to develop an eating disorder or something similar. Especially their ""sliding scale"" to ""show"" what you'd look like with lower percentages of fat.I don't use Tone for a few reasons, not the least of which is the horrible hit to battery life Amazon tells you to except. But Tone is also a horrible idea for a feature (and why it made the list for Halo is something I can not figure out). The Tone feature basically equates to telling people they need to ""smile more"". Tone seems like something that would come out of a episode of Black Mirror (or The Outer Limits / Twilight Zone for the non-Netflix crowd). A much better use of having a microphone on this device would be to incorporate Alexa / Echo into the Halo as a way to interact with it.And lastly, we have Labs. Which if I'm honest, these are just YouTube like videos in the App. And while there some big name content creators here, but they are just video's. You can't even see live metrics from your Halo band while you complete these ""Labs"" nor is there anything else (timer, etc). It's a very lackluster way to do this and left me feeling underwhelmed.And then the hardware of the Halo itself. I actually don't have too many complaints with the formfactor, but whomever created the charger for this device should be reassigned. It's overly bulky for what it does and even with its ""clamp"" like design, trying to get it aligned is much harder then it should be.And then there is the ""subscription fee"" that comes after 6 months. For what the Halo does and at $48 a year (12 * $4), its not worth it. Now if Halo did all of this without a subscription, there would be a better value there.",1
55,"I’ve been wearing my Halo for just over a week now and it’s definitely a solid fitness tracker, with some key misses.Form factor: it’s light and unobtrusive. Though I noticed it for the first day or so and thought it might be too thick, I find I barely even know it’s there anymore, whether it’s on my right or left wrist and the band it comes with is better for workouts than the “sport band” I paid extra for. I also like that there’s no display. I do find that the green lights under the band can be distracting sometimes though.Fitness tracker: I’m generally happy with it as an activity tracker so far, though I feel it undercounts calorie burn. No scientific evidence there, just that it lowers by half the calories shown on other tracking apps and devices I have. It also has trouble distinguishing certain types of activity. For example, an hour long bike ride registered 933 steps and it’s worthless for tracking my jiujitsu sessions. I did 6 intense 5 minute sparring rounds yesterday where i was dripping sweat and breathing heavy and it decided I’d been on a “Morning Walk” that was worth 200 calories. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I’m not really counting calories or steps, as I’m very active (hit the 150 point weekly goal in the first two days I had it), but I can imagine if someone is really trying to be accurate about those things, it might be annoying.App functionality: the app is simple and eye pleasing. I like that it breaks goals down weekly rather than daily as studies show that’s better for motivation. As I mentioned before, I question its judgement on some things, but I feel the sleep tracker and HR monitor are accurate, and the calorie and activity tracking is accurate enough to give me useful information about my lifestyle. I do wish they’d get rid of a lot of the extra suggested info, as I find I have to scroll past a lot of “Learn More” stuff to get to the info I actually want…they could at least get rid those sections once you click on them.Before I bought it, I saw a lot of write ups about the two things it offers that other trackers don’t: the body fat percentage tracker (which requires you to upload photos of yourself) and the voice analysis. Lots of people seem weirded out by those. I’m not and I’ve used them both. The Fat tracker is kind of strange to get used to, and some people have speculated it’s demotivating, but I felt the 25% body fat number it gave me was honest, even if it didn’t make me feel like a million bucks, and progress requires honest assessments. The voice tracker seemed gimmicky and didn’t really interest me, so I turned it off after a few days as it runs the battery down.Which brings me to another note. The charger also seems gimmicky and it took me a couple tries to figure out that unless the red light is showing, it’s not charging, even if it appears to be sitting snugly in the weird clippy thing.All in all, it does what I want and nothing more, which is fine with me. But I can see how it might not work for others.",4
56,"So a beginning note, I originally had a Garmin vivosmart HR since 2016, which I have used religiously.  However after being a full time worker, 1/2 time student, mother and wife, I find I am struggling with getting enough sleep. My Garmin did not really give me good sleep updates. it said I never got any REM sleep and I was feeling a wee bit down about that. I will outline each feature that I use below with scoring. Please note I do not use the tone feature so I will not review that feature.Sleep Tracking- 4.5- of 5The sleep tracking is very accurate and tends to demonstrate if I slept poorly or just didn't sleep enough. It also helps me keep track of the quality of my sleep, light,  heavy and rem sleep, how many time you wake up, etc. It has really helped me. That being said, my old garmin's sleep tracker was very poor compared to this one, but for my uses it works well. Only gripe is that you cant zoom in on your sleep to see exactly when you are awake, etc. If they are able to add a feature like that I would love it.Fitness Tracking- 4 of 5I tend to forget to start my Garmin's recording when I work out, so this device automatically records it, which is great.  You can also manually add activities, which I haven't had to do, however that is a nice feature. I do like the fact that it bases it all off my heart rate to show my level of effort, it helps me be mindful of it. The points system is good, but people need to remember that no device is perfect and that not always getting 150 points doesn't mean you aren't doing well. The biggest feature I use is the sedentary feature. I work 8-10 hour days (at a desk) have online classes, so it is a nice reminder to get off my rear end. This works well for my needs.Body Scanning- 3.5 of 5So I have extremely mixed feeling on this one, so let me say 1st, the scanning is fairly decent and gives you a semi accurate image, however being out of shape, the results for me personally was a mixture of depressing and motivating. I think this is a good feature but some people may not like it.Halo App- 4of 5So the app is pretty easy to use and navigate, my only gripe is that it did not link to the correct profile and I cannot change it. If this is fixed to me it works fine. I also love all the challenges, they are nice.Design- 4.5 of 5This watch is insanely comfortable to me, sometimes I can forget I am wearing it, battery life is good as long as you are not using the tone feature, and it charges very fast. it is easy to switch bands and is a smooth design. My only issue is that I miss having a watch face on my fitness band. That is only thing I would really love that they could add to a new model.Overall-4 of 5I love this and it works well for my requirements, however I would state that some people may be disappointed as what they need is different.  I would buy it again now that I have used one.",4
57,"I've been using the Halo since May 2021 and I love it.PROS:The watch is light and connects easilyCharge can just about 4 days (without tone)The app is so easy to use, and I love the nutrition add.Accurately records all data. I only know of 3 occasions where my sleep wasn't captured properlyI much prefer the language used in the app... For example, if I've had a night of less than 5 hours of sleep, it will record this as 'fair'. I had a Whoop for 18 months and I hated the language as it would constantly tell me I needed to improve my sleep which actually would stress me out.There are no glaring or flashing lights on the watch itself.The nutrition recipes are easy to followCONSMy strap is fraying so it looks unsightlyIt doesn't record napsI wish they had more options for activities. There used to be a weightlifting option but that has been removedMy charger randomly stopped working and I had to wait a day to get a new one.Would be great if it could overlay more streams of data such as sleep quality with how heavy to workout.I would love an option to add my nutrition or link to my fitness Pal.Honestly, after years of using a Whoop and a Fitbit, the Halo is hands down the best fit for me. I found the Whoop too data heavy at times and ""judgemental"". I think the Halo has some great potential and is an excellent first attempt.",5
58,"I have tested a TON of wearables, health, & fitness products.  TL;DR - this one just isn't worth it.  Better off getting something from Wyze for 1/4 the price & no subscription.  Let's break it down:GOOD:+ The band is comfortable!+ I also don't have to worry about taking it off in the shower, working in the yard, or even surfing - really robust+ The battery lasts several days (unless you use the voice mood tracking feature, which means you have to charge pretty much every night - so if you actually use the unique features of the band, this is actually a negative)+ The body model that your phone takes in the Halo app is UH-MAYZING.  Seriously bonkers.  That thing is magic.  That is, by far, the star of the show (& has *nothing* to do with the band).+ Sleep tracking is probably okay.BAD:~ The charger is yuck.  It has to clip on the watch & uses those gold-plated pogo pins.  The charger is pretty hard to align & get the watch to seat well enough to charge (multiple times came back to find it isn't charging).  The charger isn't even symmetrical, (though it looks like it is), so really frustrating to use. Also, not very strong-feeling - I'm sure it will break soon.~ The band hardly syncs.  Every time you open the app, it spends like 5 seconds deciding to sync which is a total buzz-kill.~ Doesn't tell time.  Seriously, you might not think you need it, but after you get it - you will be kicking yourself.  Whyyyyy am I wearing a ""watch"" & still don't know what time it is?!??  I  know that telling time is lame feature, but in reality, it's the most useful.~ Notifications are realllly annoying.  Basically the only notification is battery level, & it notifies you every. 10. percent. battery. drain.  As in, it doesn't update the notification, it's a new notification every time.  So, if you went to sleep at 51% & woke up at 9%, you would wake up to 5 *different* notifications simultaneously about battery level.  Interestingly, there aren't any other notifications - nothing I actually want, like ""Try to sound happier!""  or ""You seem down, do you want to talk to someone?"" or ""10,000 steps!  Awesome, you're only supposed to be at 8,500 by  now - way to crush your goals!""~ Speech mood detection feature is interesting, for about a day, but also unfortunately (for lack of a better word) useless.  It will tell you, ""You sounded frowny face for 13% of the day"" & even give timestamps for measurements. But it's really hard to know what I was saying when I sounded ""frowny face.""  So then I go full Sherlock Holmes on it, trying to backtrack my day, who I was talking to when, what the content of the convo was & what I could have said that would have come across in that nondescript way.  It's a ton of work, I frankly stressful & a little bit confidence-damaging to know you presented yourself poorly, but not have enough info to fix it.  Would be wayy better if it actually showed you a sound byte in context, like ""You sounded very empathetic when you said, 'I'm sorry for your loss, Hilda.'""~ App is also strange - like there is no content, but they try to make up with it with a bunch of links you never really wanted, like ""watch this exercise video!"" or ""listen to these soothing sounds!"" or ""listen to bedtime stories!"" or ""try to eat less salt!"" with very little rhyme or reason.  Pretty annoying.UGLY:- The data is literally useless. The device & app don't sync with *anything.*  At least on my Google Pixel phone, no syncing with Google fit.  So all of those steps?  Locked away in only amazon halo app.  So, I end up carrying my phone around anyway to track steps that sync across my health ecosystem of weight loss, exercise, & health apps.  If the data is useless, what's the point?- It has a mic, to track voice, but it kills the battery.  So does my phone, why not use my phone for this feature?- It costs ~$100.  For something without a screen?  Come on.  Wyze Band does all of these things & more & has a GORGEOUS display & costs $25.  They apparently have an even better watch coming out for $20 in 3 months.- Which brings me to the subscription... seriously?  Not only does it cost 5x up front, but we need to keep paying for it.  Hard pass.In conclusion - this seems like a solution in search of a problem.  There is literally no reason to buy this band, let alone spend $100 + a subscription for it!  The best part is the body model made by the app & your phone camera.  You get (or could get) almost all of the value & none of the headache of this device already by having your phone in your pocket.",2
59,"The band and app are both excellent products. The body fat scan was very accurate seeing as I have also had it done professionally and the scores were both very close. Movement assessment and corrective exercises are brilliant for me as I have some trouble moving my hips. I don’t get much into sleep tracking so the tracking available with halo suits my needs perfectly. It gives an overall score so you can get an idea of how well you slept and then if you want to dive into the details you are free to do so. I also find the way halo does fitness goals to be better than Apple Watch. I used to adore watching those rrings fill up. but I’m more of a numbers person and I just love watching the numbers rise higher. The variety of workouts is also amazing. There are workouts for all levels and all varieties of equipment or none at all. As somebody who struggles with how my tone sounds I think the tone feature is very useful  and has helped me put more mental effort into how I am perceived by others. All in all this is a very good product and I would definitely recommend it if you are serious about working out, however if you were not I would seriously not advise picking this up . It is nothing more than a fitness tracker. A very nice fitness tracker with features I have never seen before, but still at the end of the day a fitness tracker. Also as of August 2021 there is no way that I know of to report calorie or water intake. Maybe this will be added in at some point as Amazon is always working on their products to improve them  but I don’t know. It doesn’t even have silent alarm which is a well loved feature of Fitbit for me. But like I said it offers a lot more than I have ever seen offered in a fitness tracker before. Also a warning for those with vision issues. The demos for workouts made by Halo are not very descriptive  and you kind of have to look at the screen at least a little to get an idea of what you’re doing. As soon as I got my band I started a workout program by halo so I haven’t explored any of the other providers of workouts and how accessible they are. I wouldn’t ask a girl who just told you she’s blind about how a device looks, and honestly that’s the least important thing for me in a product like this, but I got winter and silver. I personally like it a lot. In my opinion it is neither super sleek or super ugly. It doesn’t try super hard to stand out it’s just there to do its job and I like that. Some people might not like that it Velcro‘s but I think it fastens easier than an Apple Watch band which is what I used to use. Also it’s worth noting that the back of the device that makes contact with your skin  can get a little dirty when you work out with it but I’ve use it while swimming and it holds up perfectly fine so you’re probably good to just wipe it down really quick. This has been a long one but I wanted people to have all the details so I must briefly mention battery life. Device came almost fully charged  and was very easy to set up. It charges very quickly and lasts in my experience from 2 to 3 days. It also gives your phone a notification when it’s done charging which I appreciate.",5
60,"I have tried a couple of generic ones, as well as fitbit and so far I really like the features on this one.Admittedly sometimes I feel the voice tracker is inaccurate, it will say I was angry during times I didn’t speak? But overall I like it because I work a call center and sometimes working with the general public over the phone makes it hard to keep an even tone with difficult customers, so it’s a good way to feel accountable for when I wasn’t. That was a feature that made me go for it in the first place. It does require daily charging but I usually charge it while I’m in the shower after a workout, and/or in the morning while I’m eating breakfast. It charges quickly, I just plan around it.I like the point system for exercise, I’m bad about just lounging around on my free time and having points taken away for sedentary time over 8 hours reminds me to do a little more. Plus, I don’t think one point per hour for anything more than 8 is unfair. I keep telling myself I’ll use the work outs in the app to try them, they have stretching and yoga and more intense work outs. However, I end up just doing the stationary bike or walking to the store to pick up a few things instead of driving. It doesn’t give many points for walking to the store because of a lower heart rate, but I feel held accountable for doing a more lax workout as opposed to actual fat burning cardio. Both are good and both are tracked accurately but it would be skewed and demotivating if a 20 minute light walk gave the same ‘reward’ as a 40 minute raised heart rate, heavy sweat session. And I like that you have easily attainable weekly goals, that raise if you meat them, instead of daily goals, which makes fewer points on rest days not feel bad.I do wish it tracked naps and not just sleep. It mutes the mic and acknowledges you’re asleep but just counts it as sedentary time. However, I otherwise think the sleep tracking is really good. I had an older Fitbit that had horribly inaccurate sleep tracking, and that’s what made me look for a different product to begin with. But because it tracks of you sleep hot or cold, how well you slept, and when you woke up, it helped me when I had to pick out a new mattress.I like that it doesn’t have the screen, I didn’t want one. I don’t need a watch, my phone doesn’t leave my side. The first time I tried to charge it I got frustrated, but I found that if you line it up, and then gently squeeze and kind of adjust it, you’ll see the light come on and know it’s good. That’s not great, I wish it just charged easily. But my last Fitbit charger sucked too so honestly, I’m dealing. I do like that it’s easy to pop on and off of the strap, once or twice a week I’ll pop it off while i charge it and run it through the washer with the rest of my work out clothes.  I don’t find the band terribly uncomfortable, sometimes it just takes some adjusting to get the tightness right. But I like that it’s Velcro so it can easily adjust to any fluctuations.I don’t use the body scan a lot admittedly because I struggle with disordered eating and it can be very triggering, it was a feature that drew me in but for my own mental health, I avoid it.",5
61,"Will update after more experience. So far the halo band is good overall, with some pros and cons as outlined below. It should be noted that I am basing some of this review on comparison to a Garmin Fenix 5X.First the pros:1) It is very lightweight and comfortable - Half the time I don’t even realize I’m wearing it (the main exception there would be sometimes when going to sleep, but that’s true with any sleep tracking watch I’ve worn).2) Overall the sleep tracking function is nice and seems fairly accurate. I’ve had a few questionable outputs where it says it only took me 1 minute to fall asleep, when I know it took me longer.3) Built-in training programs is a big bonus! There are a number of built-in programs (Labs in the app) that walk you through workouts (with options for different fitness levels), guide you in what and how to eat, and even tips for staying better hydrated.4) As should be expected from Amazon, the app is very easy to navigate, use, sync, and overall very visually friendly.5) Overall battery life is pretty good, without using the tone of voice feature it lasts me about four or so days.6) Tone of voice feature is cool and can provide useful insight, however, I have not used this feature too much due to the drain on the battery. I will update more on this as I use it more.Now for the cons that I’ve found so far:1) So far the step tracking over counts by a fair amount. Depending on what exercises I do in the day the step count has counted anywhere from 800-1500 more steps than my Garmin. That being said, the Garmin costs many times more than this device, so it shouldn’t be expected to be as accurate, and performs well for the price point.2) Pretty much the same with heart rate tracking. Halo seems to be a little off - or even quick to fluctuate - when compared to the Garmin Fenix (and even the “gold standard” chest strap). Again, of course, at this price point it performs well.3) Weird one here, but the charging clip is a little awkward. I’ve found that when opening the charging clip (think short fat smooth plastic clothespin) that it can slip out of my hand. This has happened to me a few times now, and really just seems to be a poor material choice as either a more textured surface, or a rubberized type of coating would likely prevent this.4) The tone of voice feature does kill the battery pretty fast if used.5) Specific activity tracking seems to not exist (or I haven’t figured it out yet). This may be because I’m used to Garmin, but I cannot find any way to track a particular activity in the app (say running, swimming, hiking, ...). So far it only shows me what activities it has automatically recognized throughout the day, and has an option to manually add an activity. This may not have been a feature planned for this device, but it would be nice to tell it I’m about to perform an activity.",4
62,"…but it severely lacks in compatibility. I got this as part of a sale as a replacement for my Apple Watch to wear while at work. I work in a watch store so wearing a fitness tracker with a screen AND a traditional watch looks a little ridiculous. This seemed like a solid fit and I was excited to have something that would work in tandem with what I currently use (my iPhone’s health app/my fitness trainer app). Despite the fact that this says “Made for iPhone” on the box, the extent of its compatibility is the Bluetooth. Other than that, the info collected by the Halo just sits there in its own self-contained app unless you connect to one of only three apps I never use (Weight Watchers, John Hancock Vitality, or Go 365). If that’s cool with you then go for this because there really are a lot of features within that app that you can use. But if you’re like me and we’re/are hoping to get something that works alongside what you are already used to using, I’d pick a better integrated brand like Fitbit.",3
63,"I bought this primarily to track my sleep.  I got curious and used it to calculate my body fat.  For some background information, in January of 2018 when I started tracking my stats the old-fashioned way, I was a dad-bod in the making at 179.5 lb at 22% body fat using the Navy method of calculation with a tape measure.  Lately I have been around 178.5 lb at 15% body fat using the same method.  During that time period I have been religiously lifting heavy weights for 6 hours a week, getting about 4 hours of moderate to high-intensity cardio per week, and eating mainly whole foods that I prepare myself.  Over that time period my waist, iliac, and hips shrunk by 2.6"", 2.5"", and 4.4"" respectively.  To my doctor's delight, I was punching new holes into my belts and my bloodwork improved so much that he took me off the medication he previously prescribed.  Like I said earlier, I bought this mainly to track my sleep since that was the only thing I had no concrete data on.  The Halo band calculated my body fat percentage to be closer to 20%.  Also, the 3D image that the app reconstructed of my body also seems out of proportion to real life.  While this sounds like I'm nitpicking and maybe a little ticked off, that extra 5% bodyfat that the Halo band generously gifted me translates to an extra 9 pounds of body fat.Update:  I've been using it for a few months now.  I've looked past the body fat calculator shortcoming.  It keeps good track of my intensity minutes and calories burned throughout the day.  Having the app running on my phone while I work out has been a game changer for me.  My workouts have become a lot more intense ever since I can actively watch my intensity minutes.  I have noticed a bug with the software.  It typically happens in the mornings after my martial arts classes.  Here is today's example: (1) I earned 14 points from walking the dogs when I woke up, (2) I earned 87 points from 1 hour and 45 minutes of Jiu Jitsu, (3) I earned another 13 random points from my heart rate being elevated after class.  I had a total of 114 points.  I took a nap after class.  When I woke up, I refreshed the Halo app to see how many points I was at.  It showed me 114 intensity minutes for the day before the refresh.  After the refresh, the band wiped everything clear.  I was starting my day again at 0 points.  Maybe the nap is throwing things off?",3
64,"This is the first device I have tried that provides health tracking services. I ended up sending the device back to Amazon because I found the price of $100 bucks and then having to pay a monthly fee on top of that was far too much for what i got from the device in the 3 weeks i tried it out.Since I just started with a fitbit on one wrist and a samsung on the other yesterday, I cant really compare the Halo to a different companies product. So far though both of them are at least more aesthetically pleasing to look at. The Halo bands that come with the product are not attractive and don't even offer the time. It would be nice it you could at least get a light or something to tell you that you need to charge the device. I found i needed to charge it only after i would see the last couple days had no sleep information.The sleep information i got seems to be nothing more informative than i am now getting from Samsungs device. I cant tell how accurate it is since I am asleep. It did provide me insight to issues that I suspected having but I otherwise would not be able to confirm. Aside from that though the information wasnt anything revolutionary that was exclusive to this device.The tone reader I was kinda excited to try out, although I live alone and in the current covid lifestyle, I was never able to have a day to set up its service. It requires you to have a day to listen to your tone and set a base line. It only made me learn how little i actually speak these days. I felt that setting a day and intentionally talking to myself to attempt to set the tone would not give me an accurate read on how i interact with others. So long story short, I dont know if this is good at that or if I would have been very impressed with what it told me.When it comes to the set up for body fat and such I also didnt get around to trying it out. I found there was a whole set up process that would require me to put my phone on a tripod and snap body shots of me in my underwear, again i live alone so I dont have a roomate or partner i can force to help me with this. So if your main want for the product is either the body monitoring or the verbal tone i would check a different review. I can only say that you have to set up both and i wasnt able to find the time to do that before i sent it back.I found the fitness tracking information to be lacking. It gives you a live heartrate but didnt really seem to keep track of much else automatically. It seemed that if you wanted to log this information you had to manually do so. it did keep track of how much you exercised that day. I am finding the information wasnt any more detailed than other companies fitness trackers.So for $100 bucks when its an ugly band on my wrist that would not even tell the time. I would rather something like the samsung that I can get the health info, plus dont need to also have a watch as well. I also like that Samsungs alerts me when i have a text message or other app notification i set it to. I was even more turned off on the price when I found that Amazon offered the device to selected invite only users for 69 bucks, but then felt that everyone else can pay an extra 30 bucks.I found the apps video offerings to be not very useful. I didn't get information that i couldn't have gotten for free from you tube.",3
65,"I’ve been a long time Apple Watch wearer, who for the last two months have exclusively worn the halo. Here’s my honest review:Pros for the Halo:- I like the point system for exercise more than the Apple Watch. It’s simpler, and I think rewards points more accurately. It’s motivating and sets a low bar for healthy living.- No annoying notifications.- LONG battery life (around a week, provided you don’t use the voice analyzer.)- Great lab interface in the app. For those unfamiliar, on the app you can opt in to different “labs” (sponsored by some big names like orange theory), specializing in fitness, strength training, etc. There is even the option to work on improving your sleep by tracking caffeine after a certain time, listening to ambient music before going to bed. The labs are well done, professional, and easy to use. Only down side is needing to watch the videos from your phone only.- Body scans are actually pretty helpful to measure BMI on an ongoing basis (the app only allows scans every 2 weeks). But more on this later.Cons:- I really miss being able to see the time. My suggestion to Amazon for version 2 is to put a super simple clock on the band. Don’t add Alexa or anything invasive, just a simple watch.- the voice analytics is a little gimmicky. It’s fun to look back at who I was talking to at 2:43pm when I was “disinterested; annoyed,” but not super practical.- I personally am not a fan of ongoing fees. For this reason (and this alone) I’ll be discontinuing my Halo subscription after the first free six months to avoid the $3/mo fee. This one is a dealbreaker for me on an otherwise great product.- sleep tracking works alright. I’ve noticed it’s not as accurate as it could be, but this probably depends on how restless of a sleeper you are.- re: Body Scans, this almost goes without saying but if you have any form of body dysphoria, do not order this product.I assume Amazon will eventually release a version 2 of this product. Some hopes I have for the future are:1. Add a clock2. Add the capacity to watch labs from the Amazon app on a tablet or phone.3. Roll the monthly fee into prime.SUMMARY:I like the Halo a lot. The Apple Watch and Amazon halo fit different needs. Evaluate for yourself which you’d prefer. Do you want something to fully integrate with your phone for both the good (texts, watch, fitness tracker) and the bad (*buzz* *BING* *HEY LOOK AT ME*)? Or are you looking for an exclusive fitness tracker that has motivating rewards and high quality fitness labs, and can go without (or like me, prefer to go without) the full phone integration? If so, the Halo may be a good choice for you.**Note: I’ve heard one of the benefits of the Halo is it’s low price point. I don’t think that’s a compelling reason. The Halo has a $3 monthly fee, meaning three years of the Halo is roughly equivalent to the Apple Watch SE.",4
66,"I bought the Halo immediately after receiving my new NordicTrack bike. I gained weight in 2020 from being sedentary & I want 2021 to be different. I specifically bought this in addition to the bike because I wanted to get an idea of just HOW sedentary my average day is when I WFH and don't exercise. This band works well for that. It counts my steps and has a point tracking system where you get assigned points based on how active you are combined with how strenuous your activities are. You're supposed to aim for 150 points per week which I think will be challenging but doable (I've only had it for 3 days and my week just reset today).After reading the reviews, I worried that the band wouldn't track my sleep accurately, but I can confidently say that it's done a good job of tracking my sleep for every one of the 3 nights thus far. In fact, I woke up for 30 minutes in the middle of the night on the first night and the app caught it. Pretty cool.I was also worried that it would be uncomfortable or that I'd have to wear it very tightly on my wrist and I can report that neither are true. I find it comfortable and do not feel as though I need to strap on for dear life. Good news!The body fat % part of the reason I bought this band. I'm short and have a thin build and so weight/BMI always tell me that I'm in the healthy range. But realistically, I'm not very active and I certainly have fat that's built up around my hips/stomach. This app does a MUCH better job of giving me a realistic picture of where I'm at body fat %-wise.I'm not sure how I feel about the voice tone analysis. It only listens intermittently. It seems to work correctly but doesn't give you a full picture of your tone throughout the day since it only seems to capture data every now and then. It also drains the battery. I'll likely leave it on for a few more days/weeks to test it and then turn it off.My only 2 major complaints are:1) The cloth band for a fitness band doesn't make any sense. I ride my bike, get super sweaty, and then my band is wet and sweaty. I ordered a different band for it but I feel like it shouldn't have come with a cloth band to begin with.2) Secondarily, I was expecting more from the UI. For example, it tracks your sleep temperature but I can't see a way to see my temperature throughout the day. I'd also like to see a timeseries graph of my heartrate overtime (instead of just displaying average and max heart rate per day in a bar graph). I previously used the ava app for pregnancy tracking and it has beautiful graphs that display your resting pulse rate, skin temperature, breathing rate, and sleep over time so I think I was expecting more from the UI but this product is new so I'm sure it will get better over time.",4
67,"I really want to give this 3 stars and also want to give this 5 stars. The tracker itself is very comfortable and over the past month and a half, I have not noticed it being on my wrist at all. I am wearing the large version and it has not slid or moved ever. I have run, slept, showered, washed dishes, lifted, shoveled snow, baked, etc. with this on, and it has neither discolored nor is the band showing wear. I was prepared for the band to need to be replaced with a rubber band but have been very surprised by its resilience.The tracking has been great and I enjoy seeing where my heart rate was on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. The sleep tracking is useful but lacks any 'coaching'. You get a score based on how much sleep you had but the scores are left for you to interpret and work on. Other fitness trackers are more engaging in this regard and actively work with you to remind you to have healthier habits. This did not bother me as I just wanted the data to work with and it is there.The 'labs' are neat but not essential in any way. I have used the meditation sleep lab to help put the kids to bed and have checked out some of the fitness-oriented labs and found them to not be my speed. Nevertheless, the inclusion of each of the labs is welcome and I look forward to growth in this area using the data and individualized videos.The reason that this band was purchased and is continuing to be used is the body fat calculator. It was a rude awakening for me when I saw the number as it was 5% higher (!!!!) than what I had been measuring myself. I used my calipers and re-learned how to accurately measure and found that Amazon was spot on whereas I had been measuring inaccurately for years.Where the tracker really fails, in my opinion, is allowing for connection to other apps that are far more granular. I would love to connect to Sleep as Android, Google Fit, MapMyRun, etc. and as this is my data, I am not sure why the only choices as of this review are John Hancock (insurance) and Weight Watchers (paid meal prep). I am hoping that more options open up in the future but that is the main reason that I would rate the tracker a 3-star product rather than a four or five-star product. It gained the extra star (4th star) as the band has greatly exceeded my expectations for durability in the first two months.As it stands, if Fitbit (Google) makes a similar body fat percentage calculator and has the app integration or ability to have app integration then I would certainly consider switching to their product. There just is not a compelling reason other than the body fat percentage calculator to stay in the Halo ecosystem. That being said, this product just recently came out of beta and hopefully there is continuing development and I can come back raving about the changes that Amazon has made.",4
68,"It’s a little difficult to get around the app to find the music programs at night, as there so much other things to do at night.I also wish it would sync with my apple health so I could sync the info with my doctor, afterall it’s my information :)",4
69,"Another update. Had my band since November 2020, it's now Feb 2021 and I do like the band, it's comfortable and seems to be accurate. However, I have noticed a worsening problem with it. Over the past months, charging has become an issue. At first it was just a little bit tricky getting it to seat in the charging clip and now it won't charge at all. I am trying to get tech support but have been ""on hold"" with chat, (waiting on a tech to help) for about an hour on more than one occasion. When I get help I'll update this again.So I've been wearing this for about 2 months or so, and I have a few developing opinions about it. It isn't much different than other trackers I've had but it is more comfortable and more reliable. So far I haven't had any issues with the Halo getting glitchy.There are a few things that they could improve however. #1 the battery life is not great, especially if you are using the tone of voice thing, that tanks the battery in less than a day. That being said, it does charge up really fast too so I just put it on the charger when I take a shower (it's waterproof but that seems like a good time to take it off & charge). #2 the sleep tracking isn't super accurate and I wish it would track naps too, rather than putting those as sedentary time & taking points away from your activity bank. Sometimes I will get up in the early early morning, like 4am, be up for 15-20 minutes and then go back to sleep & it won't recognize that as a disturbance, it will log my wake-up time as 4am. So sleep tracking could be better. #3 I really wish there was a log for heart rate, it would be nice to know how my heart rate changes throughout the day & at night. Also it would be nice if it could track hydration too - I've seen bands that offer that based on sweat. One other thing that would be nice is breathing tracker. I had a band that tracked breathing it it was really nice to be aware of how much I hold my breath or breathe very shallow. I think that's about it. I haven't tried the body fat tracking yet, just haven't gotten around to setting it up.Overall, the band is comfortable, the app is good, easy to use, not glitchy, there are available ""classes"" to use so it's like having a meditation app or an exercise app on your phone too but I never used anything like that & I don't now, I don't use my phone in that way.I guess I expected more from the band seeing as how activity/sleep tracking is not new tech so when a new band comes out I expect it to be better than the other bands out there, but this isn't anything new or exciting. It's just basically a fitness/sleep tracker with some biofeedback (voice) and tracking your body fat with photos (which you can do on your own).",4
70,"I’ll get right to the point.Pros:- Heart , sleep , and fitness seem to be very accurate and they all mesh with my Apple Watch 5 that I am wearing so I can compare.  HR is within 1-3 BPM, steps are close as well. No issues at all there.To the people who say it isn’t giving “points”.  I suggest the read the manual SMH.  It has to be worn a certain way and I can almost guarantee they are wearing it backward.It is NOT big and bulky like some say. It’s just a different feel as it’s not a watch.  I got used to it in 2 or 3 nights.Battery lasts 5 days easy maybe a little more.  And it is not hard to get it on the charger.  I really wonder about ppl sometimes.  It’s actually very simple.  Takes about 3 seconds.  If it’s taking you longer , again - read the manual.As for the whole argument about the tone settings and privacy.  I’ll say this again.  READ THE MANUAL.  You literally have to turn this function on.  It is off by default.  If you turned it on in setup by accident, guess what.  You can turn it back off.  Not rocket science.Not all is a pro tho.ConsI hate the band.  I have a medium and I am a male with small wrists.  The way they made the Velcro strips bumpy makes it a pain to get on and off.  The bumps have to pass thru the buckle and get caught.  I’ll be looking for a replacement band.Sometimes those bumped up Velcro strips get caught in my sheets and I wake up with the band hanging from my wrist and not secure.  This has only happened a couple of times tho.SummaryIt does what it says it does.  The price point however for what it does IMO is far too high and not justified especially with no oxygen sensor.  There’s bands for less that do more.But if all you need is what if offers and you want something not ugly that isn’t a watch it’s perfect.  But again - I don’t understand why it’s 100 bucks.I like it enough to wear it and not send it back.  I got the early bird price but if I had to pay the normal price ...... I would not purchase this.  But that’s me, everyone has their own value.For what it is with no screen , for this price it should have the oxygen sensor for sure.  Maybe even ekg.  Otherwise you’re  paying for a basic fitness band.  And some want that , that’s cool.  I just think it’s over priced and the value to function ratio just isn’t there.4 stars because it does what it says it does.",4
71,"The Halo is a very interesting little device. At first, I was a little unhappy with my purchase. But in just a few days, that completely changed.First I will start withCons: It is a little frustrating you cannot glance at the time. I understand why, but I still look to my wrist by default, expecting to see the time. (Maybe this can be remedied, in the future.) but I feel it makes the Halo less bulky. If I’m not wearing my watch, I have to pull out the phone. I wish the halo band just had a small screen just with time. Second, is battery life. This I think is the biggest con. If you use the voice analysis all day. It lasts about 3 days. Barely. But, you can set times you want it to record your conversations or even leave that function off.Now for the good stuff!I cannot praise the voice analysis enough. I’m shocked how well it actually works. And the more you use this, the better reading you will receive. It shows notable moments, which you can look at on the app. But, how accurate it is, is truly amazing. You will not be disappointed in that feature. I feel I can truly learn from these moments to better interact with family, friends and coworkers.Second up, is comfort. I used have a Fitbit watch and I was constantly having to wipe away sweat from where it was on my arm. Sometimes making it very unpleasant. With this band, Amazon made the right call with the fabric they use. I have no issues with sweat any more and the band feels far more comfortable than the Fitbit. It does not pull out my arm hair and the Velcro strap allows for the ideal fit as opposed to watches that sometimes end with you having to choose between 2 holes, in which neither fit well. The sleep tracker is very accurate, and all other features seem to be on par with any other good smart watches. I feel too that it is probably more accurate than the other watches, just because when you fit it right, it remains close to your wrist, and does not wiggle around. The App is very easy to use. And provides many programs that are tailored to you from the readings pulled from the Halo.My final, but significant plus, is that since it is from Amazon, like Alexa, it learns more about you and many new updates are always in the works. I don’t believe Fitbit can rival that.To conclude, if you are looking for a smart watch that has a display, tell you who’s calling etc. This is not the watch for you. If you want an accurate reading of everything else, I would highly suggest this watch. The snug comfortable band, almost becomes unnoticeable. And I love, the voice analysis. It is such a cool feature. Hope this review helps.",4
72,"If you are looking to get fit and change your routine I think this would be greatIf you are already fit and looking for more insights, this is not great IMO- If you are looking for something to track sleep, this is very good for that- Halo has a very simple activity tracking mechanism that basically tells you low/med/high.  I'm pretty fit so this didn't really give me any insights, but I could see it being useful for somebody trying to get fit and use this as a motivator- The body fat feature was cool, and I think most beneficial for people just starting on a fitness journey. I'm already pretty fit so I don't predict I will see much movement here as I'm in more of a maintenance mode- I like how the exercise videos are short and targeted which makes it easier to get into your daily routine. There are very few sponsored by the big names like Orange Theory so don't expect thatI had a Whoop and the two accounts overlapped for a week so I could compare the 2, here is what I noticed:- Both sleep efficiency %s were the same, so for example both would say 95%.  Though they reported different results for the sleep stages. Whoop seemed to report more REM and Deep sleep than Halo each night- RHR and heart rate were identical across the 2- No journal feature like Whoop if that is something you care about- I like the way both of them look- No HRV for Halo. That is the most important metric for me. Without that, it's not worth wearing on my wrist daily and I'm not. I bought it for a good deal, the price is great for Halo.  When the 6-month subscription runs out I won't renew unless they add HRV",3
73,"I wanted to try this to augment a Garmin device that I wear for workouts. The watch that I use predates Garmin's use of Firstbeat sleep tracking, so it's abysmal, I liked idea of the body scanner as I'm trying to lose weight, and having my all day activity tracked by something without a display means I can wear any watch I want and not lose the data. During my trial period, I wore it side by side with a Garmin watch (Fenix 5 Plus). I wore it on every workout, I went a week without a charger with a road-trip on each end (that's important, and I'll explain later), and today I took it off and didn't put it back on.Firstly, let me say what it does well:- The body scanning does appear to be pretty accurate, and I really like that part. A lot of people seem not to, but I think it's really cool to see the 3D render of my body, and my BF number actually read very close to what my BF scale measures (though I know those aren't super accurate either). The numbers passed the sniff test for sure.-Sleep tracking was bang on. There was always a delta between this and my Garmin, but the Garmin's numbers seemed impossible, and these seemed to track perfectly with what I knew about the night (time in bed, time to get to sleep, tracking time I was up reading accurately, and nailing every wake up - I do have a toddler in the house. This gives me a lot more confident in the parts of the night that I'm asleep for. :)-I found the strap to be really comfortable to get a good snug fit high on my wrist, as is necessary for this type of device to be accurate.The let down:Ultimately, it's let down by one big thing: accuracy. Look, it's an optical HR monitor, but Amazon is a big player. They should have the money to be at least as accurate as say, a 10 year old Scosche optical HR monitor, but it's not. Not at all.Firstly, during workouts.- Biking is notoriously hard for wrist based sensors, so I won't dwell on it, but let's just say it didn't pick up I'd done anything at all. No activity detected, HR was basically at walking around levels for the time I was biking 15 miles.- I did a full effort 5k run yesterday, wearing a HR strap paired to my Garmin, my HR averaged 166 BPM, and went as high as 180. The Halo reported an average of 125 and a max of 146.- Longer lower HR runs were a lot better. I did a slow run a few days ago, and a Garmin HRM-Pro put me at an average of 143 BPM and a max of 164, and the Halo had me at 139-160 respectively, and the graphs looked pretty well the same.But man, don't wear it in the car. I mentioned a road trip I did recently? On the way out the door it recorded that I did an activity that lasted like an hour with a 170 BPM max and on the ride home? A 48 minute actvity with a 167 BPM average and a 210 BPM max got recorded for the most points I earned the entire time I had the thing. Also of note, I'm pretty sure it just tops out at 210, because there's a big flat spot in the graph there.So, if you're actually active, or if you ever drive a car, this might not be the device for you. Now, optical heart rate accuracy can be fixed in firmware, so they might fix it. I sent them feedback, but never heard back on that.The nit-picking:There are a few things that I don't like that aren't really a downside to the platform, just a personal preference thing: I like a dashboard that I can view on my computer while I'm working. And the tone stuff was useless to me. I had it on for a couple of days then just turned the mic off. I'd rather they not listen to me all the time any way.Overall, I just couldn't recommend this device to anyone that is active and wants at least kinda accurate HR from the wrist. And btw, before you say that you can't get that, Apple has nailed HR from the wrist. Garmin is decent at it. And Amazon has enough resources that they should at least be to that level, IMHO. Perhaps through firmware updates they'll get there in time.",2
74,"Pro:* Comfortable* Stays put* Pretty unobtrusive - I did not feel awkward wearing it on my opposite wrist from my Apple Watch.* Voice tone analysis is interesting. It isn't functional enough or useful enough - even if it always accurate - to be something that I'd want. If you can't tell when you're being a jerk in conversation, you need more help than the Halo is going to give you. Plus knowing that for it to work, my conversations have to be uploaded to Amazon...yeah, no.Con:* Recurring subscription for a minimally useful product.* Charger is finicky. Takes multiple tries to get it positioned properly. A magnetic connector would be a better bet, like the Microsoft Band did, for example. They were similarly sized devices* Charger will not work when plugged into either of my dedicated device charging stations. Even my HyperJuice that easily charges my iPhone, iPad, AirPods & Watch...it simply will not work. It won't charge using any of the dozens of high-power generic USB wall chargers I have either. Nope. I have to plug it into a USB device on a computer or on a USB port extender. Bizarre.* It's misleading to suggest that the Halo is giving me a body fat percentage. That entire process is done with my phone camera, the band was not part of it. Truth in advertising.* Also regarding the body fat number: 2x accurate than body fat measuring scales? It produced nearly the exact same number as my 5 year old digital body fat scale, but it takes minutes instead of seconds and requires a tripod or other means of positioning your phone to see you properly - far too long to do it regularly. This would be a loser even if it was more accurate (it isn't) and given the extra time and difficulty...it's the biggest loser.* no blood oxygen* no way to tell the device when I'm starting a workout versus just climbing the stairs to the 5th floor* no way of integrating with the rest of my health and exercise data. This is kind of a big deal for me because where my Apple Watch records my workouts by activity type and maintains a clear record for me of every day that I met or did not meet my goals, going back forever, the Halo is much less functional. That would be easier to overlook if I could push the Halo data to Apple Health, but it doesn't do that. Other bands do, e.g. Fitbit.Accuracy:The Halo was no more accurate than the other separate devices that I use. For workouts/calories it was ""close enough"" with the Apple Watch but the inability to tell it when I was working out made it less accurate for deliberate exercise.For body fat, it was close enough to my digital scale to be a coin flip, and that accuracy gets worse if your posture changes or you tighten your abs. The scale doesn't care if you're flexing or not.For sleep, it was less accurate than the Withings Sleep device that sits under my mattress, is completely invisible, records snoring and breathing disturbances, and never needs to be charged.Overall the accuracy was what you'd expect from something that is a fraction of the cost of buying an Apple Watch, quality digital scale, and dedicated sleep tracker. If you want some of that tracking data, albeit less of it and at lower accuracy but for a much lower price this might be a good fit. Otherwise, you're better off with the established players in the field, at least for now.",3
75,"I've had the Halo for a 2-3 months now and overall I'd say it's pretty good. I'm at a point of using it now that I'm evaluating similar products and I can't find a good enough reason to purchase a different one. One of the deciding factors for me was the wearable-but-not-a-smart-watch aspect. I'm not interested in a health tracker attempting to be a smart watch. Give me a wearable sensor that isn't intrusive.So...that leads me to evaluate against the way more expensive Whoop and the also pricey Oura ring. Right off the bat the Oura is out, it can get damaged by workouts and doesn't track fitness activities (that's not the intent of it either). The Whoop at $300/yr is unreasonable but it's while more in line with what I want to see it's also bulkier than the Halo strap, not particularly nice to look at and I just can't convince myself to spend so much.In summary: what I like most:Form factor, just a small bracelet on my wrist (I face the sensor on bottom of my wrist)PriceBattery lifeSync with the app occurs seamlesslyIn general the way your data is rendered in the app is good, though I'd like to see more depth.What I don't like:The app is good but far too much fluff. I don't care about suggested food, meditation or exercises.Amazon if you're reading this, please give me an option in the app to disable all that fluff.",4
76,"The Halo band and app are a pretty good option for a low-effort, all-in-one solution that delivers on convenience but not necessarily on accuracy.  I appreciate the new ground that the solution is breaking with the voice ""tone"" analysis and visual body scans.  Those have been pretty interesting to test.My biggest problem with the Halo system is the lack of accuracy. I've been tracking personal biometrics for quite some time now using various devices and apps; I've invested in some very well-reviewed and highly accurate solutions.  My hope was that the Halo would match their accuracy, add some new capabilities, and be more convenient.  However, accuracy is a such a serious issue with the Halo that it falls short.  I'm still using it - trying to find ways to tweak it for more accuracy, but I'm also using all my other devices as I can't trust the Halo.Sleep - I have a Muse S band that actually measures my brain waves for specific sleep patterns.  It is a research grade tool that is highly accurate.  The Halo has a bug, in that it shows me having very short (2-3 minutes) awake periods repeatedly when I'm sound asleep - sometimes 20-30 of these a night.  My Muse S and my own experience validate that I'm not waking up that often.  However, those short periods add up, and the Halo consistently shows me awake for an hour or more each night as compared to my Muse S.  This throws off the Halo Sleep Scoring and makes the whole sleep tracking experience frustrating.Activity - I use both Wahoo and Polar chest bands to measure my heart rate during riding, HIIT, and weight lifting.  I find that for the Halo to accurately detect the activities, I need to make sure it is synced right before I start the activity.  Also, on my longer rides I find that I need to periodically bring up the Halo app and have it check my live heart rate to keep aware of things.  Otherwise it will drop certain sections of the ride and a single long ride will show up as 2-3 separate activities separated by 5-10 lapses.  Lastly the calorie count reported by the Halo is very low, sometimes 50% lower than the Wahoo app and I already have it conservatively set.Body Scan - I applaud the new body scan technology.  I'm a firm believer that machine-learning-powered features like this are going to be great... but the Halo version seems to still be a bit inconsistent.  I have a very high end scale that measures body fat via foot and hand impedance with multiple samples per measurement.  I also get dexa scans (extremely accurate % body fat readings) on a periodic basis so I know how to adjust my scale's impedance measurements for total accuracy.  The Halo body scan seems to have issues with repeatability.  I can go a week with no zero change in body fat and the Halo will show a +/- 3-4 pound change.  One time I went on a one-week fast eating 400 calories per day (search: ""fasting mimicking diet"") while continuing my exercise routines.  I lost 8 lbs of water, 4 lbs of fat, and 1 lb muscle.  The Halo showed me gaining 1 lb of fat.Voice Tone - This feature seems to recognize my voice in various zoom calls and personal conversations.  However, 95% of the time it says I'm ""normal"", so I didn't find much use for it, and it was a terrible drain on the battery life, so I deleted my voice print and disabled it.",3
77,"Update: I returned my Halo.  I wore for 2 to 3 weeks, 24 hours (except for charging), so I had a good impression of the device and Halo app.  The sensor was too uncomfortable.  It's not flat or evenly distributed, so it feels like it's pressing into the wrist and there's no way to adjust it to make it more comfortable.  I compare it to having used Fitbits and an Apple Watch.  I was also disappointed that I couldn't connect to the Halo data from my PC or Mac.  (That's possible with other tracker software.)  The only place to view data is through the app, which could only be on one device (phone or tablet), whichever was used to connect by bluetooth.  I wanted to have the app on my phone and tablet, but it required going through set up again, entering all my personal information like a new set up.  That would have interfered with syncing going forward.  I determined the investment in the Halo was more than I wanted to make when there are more dependable trackers and software on the market.  I still say try it if you want.  It is a quality product.  It's just not for me.  Everyone is different.Original evaluation:  The Amazon Halo is about normal for a first version Amazon product.  I’ve experienced that Amazon hypes up and promotes a new item for sales, but the product ends up being only average and some times not ready for prime time.  For example, I purchased the Halo specifically for syncing with the Weight Watchers app, which  tracks food, activity, and sleep for points.  The thing is, the Halo programmers didn’t add the sleep tracking data point as a selection when authorizing the data sharing with Weight Watchers.  So, the only thing Halo does is syncs activity, which can be done with the other big names, Fitbit and Apple Watch.stI’ve had 3 or 4 Fitbit products before going with an Apple Watch and both were more comfortable.  I understand and appreciate the concept of having no annoying, distracting screens, but unfortunately it’s inherent human behavior to lift the wrist to at least check the time when something is strapped to your wrist.  I read comments that the Halo rests too high, appearing awkward on the wrist.  I believe it’s the same size as other similar shaped trackers, but the design of having the band go over the device instead of connect at its ends gives the appearance of it being higher.  Seeing the gap at the ends is perception.  Perhaps molding or shaping the ends to wrap or curve with the wrist under the band would fix this aesthetic issue.  I think it also adds to the discomfort of the device pressing down on the wrist because the band is strapped over the device instead of connected at the ends.  The pressure presses the Halo down and into the wrist.  A strap connected at the ends pulls the device to conform around the wrist.Overall, if you want to try it, I say go ahead.  Like everything Amazon, the backend needs work.  They take care of marketing and sales very well, at the expense of device operation and whether its ready for the market.  I guess we’re the test subjects for later iterations of the Halo.  I’ll use for a while, but there is nothing spectacular about it and it’s definitely not worth the subscription service.  Maybe athletes have a different opinion.  I am not an athlete but I do want a comfortable, appealing tracker to help get me moving and paying attention to my health.",3
78,"I’ve been using the Halo for a few months now and I am kind of shocked at how much I like it. It has it’s Pros & Cons and of course there are things it can’t do that fitness bands do... but for me, it is more of a Health & Wellness Band.  My thoughts...**The Sleep Feature is by far the best I’ve found available. I had no idea what a deep dive I could take in to my sleep quality (or lack there of). With the use of the details on the Halo, I’ve been able to learn more and implement some changes that have drastically improved my quality of sleep.**I tried out the Tone Feature for a couple days and while it did prove to be accurate based on how I knew I felt during the conversations it analyzed, I personally found no value to it and it drained the battery.**I like having access to the information in The Body Feature... even though I do not like what it told me at all. I definitely see the value in it for health reasons and how it can be a motivator. I would like to have my body comp done professionally and compare the two results for accuracy at some point. But until then, it is a great jumping off point and I see only positives in this feature.**Using The Activity Feature has really helped me to recognize just how inactive I’ve allowed myself to become. BUT because the Halo gives value to different types of activity and not just “steps”, it hasn’t made me feel negatively about that realization. I’ve found that I feel good about any and all activity at any intensity level. And I don’t want to see too many points taken away for being sedentary either so that is a motivator. Also, the weekly points goal is nice because if I have a down day, I can work to build up points another day.**Having access to the Labs is a great feature too! There are so many different things that you can try out, learn about or use to improve upon, such as sleep quality, in the Labs and they’re tracked for you in the app.I would like to see the Halo app sync with Apple Health but I doubt that will happen.I did find that after wearing the band for more than 24 hours, my wrist would itch along the outside of the band. It stopped once I took it off and put lotion on so I don’t know if it’s the band or maybe seasonal dry skin... but I wanted to share anyway. I put it back on shortly and it’s fine.Of course, if what you’re looking for is a fitness watch/band like an Apple Watch or a FitBit, this isn’t it. But if you’re looking for something that has more of a simplistic approach or maybe even holistic in some ways, I would encourage you to give it a try.",4
79,"I was intrigued by the tone analyzer that's the main reason why i got this Halo band - I know people may be worried about your wristband listening to you, sounds creepy right? well, if you have any smart home devices, google home, alexa etc., they may be listening to you anyway so what's new. the tone analyzer asked you to read out a few paragraphs to train the band to listen to your voice only , which turned out to be pretty accurate. it seems like it's spotting the words you use to generate real-time and summary report on your tone, mood, energy based on the word choice of yours. turning on the mic all day long does drain the battery fast, so i only turn it on when i have important conversations that i want to see the results. if you turn mic on, the battery can sustain for about a day.battery-wise, it is MUCH better than Apple Watch, but it is also expected due to its basic functionalities. it does not have a screen - less distraction but you can check basic info such as time. the perks of having good battery is that you can wear it at night to analyze your sleep pattern. it gives info such as sleep efficiency (time asleep as a % of time in bed), sleep body temperature, sleep cycle, time to fall sleep, time asleep etc. and uses this info to calculate a sleep score. I love all this info but again, looking for insights from these patterns.body scan - it does not appear to be able to connect to smart scale etc. so the body fat etc. is calculated based on a body scan, i.e. taking 360 photos of you wearing minimal clothing... you gotta trust the privacy before you do that. the body fat rating is very different from what i got from my smart scale, and honestly i do not know which one to trust....step taking - to compare the accuracy, i wear Apple Watch and Halo at the same time on different arms. Halo typically records 20%-30% more steps than Apple Watch, e.g. on a normal day without workout, Halo records 5k-ish and Apple 3k; when Apple records 16k-ish, Halo would read 20k-ish. again, i can't tell which one is accurate or how they measure steps (would arm swing be considered??)aesthetic - the pink is a pretty pastel pink color which is absolutely beautiful, the fabric, however, is something i have reservation for.. it gets dirty quite fast and if you wear wristband when you exercise, i bet it gets stinky.Halo lab - another selling points is the access to the halo lab and classes. honestly.. i have way too many other subscription services and built my data there, i do not see the needs to migrating to Halo unless they have something absolutely better.overall, it is a basic wristbands. it has potentially but i would not consider it as a replacement for Apple Watch. I have not used fitbit before so can't say much there.",4
80,"I was happy to get my Halo and to see if I was really as active (or non-active) as I thought I was. I was very intrigued by the research/thought process of the more you exert yourself the more points you should get. I also wanted to know how inactive I was as I have an office job and ""sitting is the new smoking"".The Good:My first week I did not change any routines. I got 58 active points for a week (the goal according to the American Heart Association is 150). The Next week, using a suggested lab, I made one adjustment, a 15 minute walk before noon each day. I ended up with 98 points that week (I ultimately did other things that week as I felt motivated to do so). The next week I improved even more and got 178 points. This is the point of the Halo and how a few little tweaks can help us be more active through feedback. I loved this aspect of it!!!I was OK with the body scan, it was neat, it gave me feedback that I expected. I didn't think it was creepy.The sleep info was neat, but I did find it was less accurate the longer I had it.There is also a HALO Group on a Social Media site and the support of the Amazon Customer Service Team listening to our concerns and feedback on this first generation product have been top notch!!!The Bad:The Battery Life! It's supposed to last up to five days without tone enabled, this really did vary. I got anywhere from 3-5 days from a charge. Updates were pushed to enhance battery life, but the updates didn't seem to last in my experience.I did use tone for one day - it killed my battery within 24 hours (should take 48 hrs). Tone does not understand sarcasm at all, but otherwise it is pretty much on the mark.The tracker is a lot larger and not as thin of a profile as I had imagined and it was more noticeable on my arm than I would have liked. I also inadvertently (I assume) kept disconnecting the band by bending my wrist. However you just tap it twice and it connects and syncs again - no biggie, just a bother if you quickly want to glance at info.I had a lot of trouble syncing the band with an Android device. Then I upgraded my phone, and even with a brand new phone, it had issues and I had to factory reset the band to sync it. When it finally did sync, I had to start my account all over from the beginning, nothing carries over from phone to phone which is worth noting.I did also experience some MINOR irritation on my wrist from the band. I could occasionally feel some shocks when the band was wet and came into contact with my skin. I readjusted the band to make it looser and also swapped back to the fabric band (I was using the sport band which help a lot of moisture). I additionally chose not to wear the band when I got wet. These were my decisions on how to mitigate the irritation. I did report the irritation to Customer Support, they were excellent in their response and support.I ultimately decided to return my Halo for a refund as I feel that it was not for me at this time. I think that it has the potential to be a great product if used as intended (shift habits, provide feedback). It's not your traditional fitness tracker. Amazon just have a few more kinks to work out and I believe they are working on those diligently.",3
81,"I normally use an older Fossil Smartwatch that doesn't have a heart rate monitor and the battery life is such that I have to charge it every night -- so I was missing out on these 2 features in particular from using a fitbit or the like, but really like my smartwatch otherwise. I had the chance to get a Halo band and took it, especially since it links directly to the Weight Watchers online program. The step accuracy is pretty good. My Google Fit app (connected on my watch) shows about the same at the end of the day as the Halo app does -- and the Halo has the bonus of checking my heartrate to categorize my activity (low, medium, high intensity).For sleep tracking, it does fairly well, but there are a number of nights where I have missing data. The disclaimer that shows says I was either sleeping on it, it was too loose or too tight, but I'm not sure how to go about correcting that since I typically have it at the same tightness. I also think some nights it doesn't pick up what time I actually go to bed. For example, I'll go up around 10:30, read until about 11, but the app doesn't show me going to bed until 1am. There's currently no way to edit these times. While I may not know exactly when I fall asleep, I would like to be able to at least tell it what time I went to bed and let it adjust from there.Battery life is excellent with Tone disabled and ok otherwise. I normally get about 2 days with Tone and 4 or 5 without it. It charges fast enough that I put it on the charger when I take a shower and it's generally nearly complete - or with Tone, at least enough for a day's usage plus some - when I'm done getting dressed (~30 minutes). Usually, about once a week, I need to do a slightly longer charge, so I just put it on while I'm at work and sitting at my desk and let it fully charge that day. I'd estimate the 30 minutes adds about 40% battery, and with Tone I'll use about 50% a day.The charger is my biggest complaint. It's yet another proprietary/special charger rather than using a general QI/wireless or USB-C cord -- so it's one more thing I have to either remember to pack if we travel or I'll have to buy a spare to leave with our travel cords. It's also a little tricky to get the pins lined up and charging started. I sometimes have to jiggle it around before the light comes on. And there's no indicator on the band when the battery is low. If you don't check your app, you may not realize you're wearing a dead band since there's no screen. It would be helpful if the lights could flash in a particular way to give you a heads up. I may have noticed a single flash around 5% remaining, but it wasn't consistent enough for me to know that was the problem. I just happened to check the app a little while later and noticed I was at 3%.I also highly recommend the silicone bands. In about 2 months, my light silver fabric band is already showing stains on the inside of my wrist, and I only get it wet when washing my hands. I don't wear it in the shower (as I said, that's when I charge it), and I haven't been swimming since getting it. My silicone band should be arriving today, so I'm hoping that helps.",3
82,"I watched a few YouTube videos of the Halo from people who regularly wear fitness trackers that tended to emphasize a couple of negative themes (not like other fitness trackers and perceived intrusiveness of the AI features).  I didn't think these applied to me, so I ordered a Halo during Prime Day and am very pleased with it.I had recently lost a lot of weight on a low-carb diet and had been increasing my exercise levels.  So my primary goal for the Halo was to have something that helped me assess my health status.  The ""Body"" feature did a great job of showing me that I still had a lot of body fat that I could lose and gave me an easy way to measure it regularly.  The ""Sleep"" tracker works well and helps confirm the quality of my snooze time.  The ""Activity"" feature similarly does a nice job of assessing how much movement I'm getting.  I find the ""Tone"" feature pretty interesting.  I tap the button when I'm starting a conversation that I'm interested in analyzing.  The Halo just got a new ""Movement"" feature.  I found the analysis of where I had issues in mobility and stability to be very accurate, and the exercises in the recommended program seem like they will probably help me to improve.I like the fact that I don't really need to think about it.  The Halo may not perfectly identify when I start or stop a workout, but it measures my overall activity without me needing to tell it anything.  The tips that it offers seem to be quite good.  I haven't tried the many workout programs available in it.  While it doesn't really need charging that often, I find it easiest to just toss it in the charger for a little while each morning and the notification on my phone reminds me to put it back on my wrist.  The charger is a little bit of a weird physical design, but the charging LED tells me it's working.  The band design is a little cumbersome for putting on and taking off.  But since I only do this once or twice a day, it's not a big deal.  Since I wear it on the wrist where I used to wear a watch, I have noticed myself looking at it to check the time (which makes me laugh).I'm not worried about Amazon having access to my voice recordings or images of me.  From a privacy perspective, I assume that most large companies have an incredible amount of data on me any way.  For a product like this, I think Amazon has a very strong incentive to keep this data private.  The kinds of penalties that big companies can face for demonstrated privacy violations greatly outweighs the value they could get from using this data beyond it's stated purpose in my opinion.So if you're looking for an extremely focused fitness tracker or sleep tracker, I'm guessing there may be better options for your specific need.  If you're looking for a tool that helps you assess and modify your health across multiple dimensions with minimal input needed from you, then the Halo seems like it could be a great fit.",5
83,"I have been using this product for 30 days now and I must say I am pretty impressed. I have an issue with sleep and yeah...hate to admit but my tone as Halo nicely puts it.What I love:Halo has allowed me to track my tone through out the day and even track a conversation tone I am having with someone so I can learn better on how to go about not being so stressed or who makes me stressed in the least. It also correlates my sleep with my tone and heart rate and more and makes it so much easier to pin point sleep disturbances and man this little guy is very accurate.Another thing I absolutely love about the Halo is that it accurately gives me my activity for the day. How I have been too sedentary and truly tracks my activity points correctly from regular steps to more aggressive walking and more. Why let a bracelet tell you took 6k steps and you burned x amount of calories when this little guy tracks your heart rate and intensity as well so you show accurate results in burning calories.The band is so easy to clean, take it off, pop off the tracker and clean it. Dries fairly fast and ready to use again.The Halo also charges really fast. I put it on for around 30 minutes and it tells me it is ready to go again.Heart rate tracker is very accurate. I actually found out I have tachycardia because of this little bracelet and now I am able to address this with my physician.Plus all the little extra features like exercise videos, the 'lab' and more...What I dislike:I have not yet been bold enough to try out the camera option to track your body fat, ugh. Maybe I will when I get brave enough. So I cannot comment on that.I wish more apps could connect to it like calorie counting, food intake and more options. However, I do believe that they will in the future because well, it is an Amazon product and Alexa damn near connects to everything nowadays.It gets a little tight sometimes and irritates slightly if you are sweating but so does every other fitness bracelet.Options on bands are few and far in between, would love to see more of those in the future.Overall I am really excited to have been one of the first ones to try it out. I did receive a promotional offer discount for Halo but this does not change my mind about this review. This is an honest review from an honest person who needs to get back into shape! I would recommend this if someone is looking for a better alternative to fitbit or apple fitness apps. It is not bulky, not uncomfortable and is extremely accurate. Look forward to all the additions that come in the future.",4
84,"One of the main reasons that I decided to get one of these is because of its minimalist style. I really enjoyed how it just looked like a little stylish wrist band to others, but was a smart device at the same time. I also wear an apple watch so it didn't look to weird to wear both bands. Some features that I really liked included; Sleeping, gave a nice score and estimate of how I slept. It gave similar stats that my apple watch would. 2nd the mobility score was really helpful, I thought they were very accurate and even ended up helping some shoulder issues I had with little exercises it reminded me to do. Went from a rough 78% to a higher 80% over a couple months of exercising the areas. 3rd the Body Fat % is pretty neat, it was weird to take selfies in order to get statistics for something like this. Surprisingly it was fairly accurate, I have done some BodPod % test and the numbers were very close. Lastly I do like the activity stat as its something that got me to get up and try to be more active when I see that it says I have been sitting down for a too long.There was really one issue that started to take place, which was the heart rate sensor. As I stated that I wear an Apple watch too, I can compare certain statistics by looking at both. One day the Halo started to struggle on showing an accurate HR during workouts. While doing some HIIT exercises the Apple watch was on point where was the Halo would say I would peak around 120bpm, and that is off by almost 60 beats. I'm not sure why it started to mess up but it was really annoying. I do still wear it, but not really for the fitness aspect anymore. I do not think I will continue using it for long, but it was nice while it lasted. Could possibly have gotten damaged somehow? But I am a cautious person and have not dinged it or anything like that.smh this was long, have a nice day :)",3
85,I purchase it at $39 when there is a promotion . Not doing very well on tracking sleep but the rest is fine now. I have not use the body fat yet because it’s difficult and complicated to set up. I like it more than Apple Watch because it doesn’t need to charge so often and the outlook is cool. My schoolmates ask me where I bought this servers times lol,4
86,"First of what some people see as a gimmick-The BMI Body scan.https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538610/amazon-halo-body-fat-percentage-accurate-studyGo a head and take a gander at that article. ""Amazon’s Halo body fat percentage calculator outperforms lab devices.""It's a useful tool, and after showing it to my Dr. we went ahead and played on all his fancy equipment and much to both of our surprise it was damn accurate. So it was nice to see that article today where someone was testing it on a larger scale.Additionally my day 1 scan i was at 227lbs and 32 BMI. Day 31 after a month of lifting I've started toning a bit but I was worried because I weighed in at 230, but Halo recognizes my gains(toning) and my weight at 230 turned to a BMI of 28%.I will probably keep my subscription for that alone.Next-Sleep Monitoring:It tracks just as well as every other device I've put on my wrist and most of the info I get from my sleep apnea machine lines up. So I can't complain there either.Active Heartrate: In the app there is a ""live"" section so you can see your heart rate in real time for as long as you keep it open. I use it on the treadmill to regulate my heart rate. I have a max I like to reach, then walk back down to a minimum to keep my zone. It matches the machines I use and the chest strap so I feel pretty confident in it's accuracy.Fitness: The halo band uses a metric like my Pai band did where your points are based on the intensity of your activities through out the day not just your steps. It's scientifically proven that people who have a certain level of activity in their lives live longer and healthier. This gives you a good measurement of where you fall in and fall short. You get more points for intense activities and actually lose points for long periods of no activity.Voice analyzing: This is more of a gimmick in my opinion, but not unhelpful. With meditation and practicing self awareness, I like to turn this on for important conversations, work interactions, and when I'm talking with my children. However they analyze this and break it down is beyond me, it is interesting to go back to these conversations and based on the data, really get in touch with how I was feeling once the situation/anxiety is over. I don't leave it on because hot damn does it drain the battery....Battery: Without the voice monitoring I get a week easy. This is hitting the gym 4-5 days a week, using the live heart rate monitoring each of those days for a bit. It charges in about 2 hours from 10% to 100% and the app lets you know when it's ready.Subscription: As mentioned above, the BMI scan and the upcoming ""Flexibility Scan"" are almost worth it to me. There are a ton of meditation, workout, HIIT classes and more in there. I haven't used much of that yet but it's all there.I can't say this band is for everyone, but I for one am happy to have it. I feel freed by the lack of screen(not checking my wrist every 5 minutes) and the information it gives me is exactly what I need.",5
87,"I previously used Fitbit for a few years. When I purchased the Amazon Halo I had been without a fitness tracker for 10 months. I use trackers mainly for sleep and heart rate, everything else is considered extra for me. For these two uses I do not recommend the Halo and I think the biggest issue is the app; the device is tracking so much information about the user but does not offer that data in an easily accessible way. Amazon also needs to work on allowing the Halo Band/app data to sync and integrate with more apps.Heart Rate: I do not find the Halo tracker a valuable tool for tracking heart rate because I'm offered very little information about it. For example, in the Fitbit app you click on specific parts of your heart rate graph and you're told the value and time of measurement. The Halo app not only doesn't give this info (it only tells you the highest rate of the day) but it's also extremely cumbersome just to navigate to the heart rate information/graph.Sleep Tracking: It does what it claims to do even though it's difficult to tell how accurate it is. I'm often questioning why my time asleep is really high or really low; I rarely wake up and look at these values and say ""that sounds about right"". Again, hard to tell if it's accurate as I have nothing to compare it with.Sleep Temperature: This is a cool feature and I find the results interesting. I wish it would provide the user with the measured value but my understanding is that a temperature taken on the wrist/arm is going to be a lot lower than a normal body temperature. This means it's easier for Amazon to offer us a plain comparison from day to day rather than give a value that might scare some users. Still I wish I could access that value on the app.Body Scan:  I've used it twice. I have a hard time believing it's accurate (seems really high) but I think it's a cool technology that will hopefully continue to be improved upon. I don't know why the fitness band is required for this technology but I get what Amazon is trying to do.Tone: It's a cool feature but it just kills the battery way too quickly. I also think that it would be helpful to know what you said when you were rated sad, angry, happy, etc. Even if it doesn't save voice recordings, it would seems possible to include the understood words you spoke around that time; there needs to be a better way to think back about what conversation was happening during these ratings.Labs: I think the labs are cool. To be honest these are probably the best part about the band/app. Having said that, I know I could get these same kinds of programs elsewhere without having to pay the upfront cost of a fitness tracker.Charger: I hate it. It has the same clamp attachment as the smaller/older Fitbits but for some reason it's a pain to get on correctly. Because I don't use the tone analysis my battery lasts almost a week.In summary, I have already told several friends/family that I do not currently recommend the Halo Band. However, I have chosen not to return it. I've already spent the money and the effort setting it up (sunk cost, I know!) but I also hope it will continue to be improved and sometime in the future I'll be left with a usable heart/sleep tracker and the need to edit this review.",3
88,"I only used the activity and sleep tracker. I did like my Fitb*t app data displays better.The halo band was comfortable, dried quickly, and as promised is not distracting. I rarely found my Fitb*t watch screens(I’ve tried 3) responsive enough and rarely want to interact with the band, so Halo was a good idea.I wish the app provided a look at the underlying data rather than such a general summary.I gave it a week trial.I’m still searching for the tracker that makes me glad to wear it, that gives me the counts and inspiration to do more. I want to see my heart rate during exercise. I think for me that’s key. I don’t want to see it while I exercise but I like to review workouts afterwards to see if the data corroborates I’ve worked harder. Particularly with pool aerobics I’ve yet to find a tracker that gives me credit for pool workouts unless my hands are above the water…Maybe this means I should just rely on how I feel instead!",4
89,"I've been wanting a fitness tracker for a while, but I have very specific things I'm looking for. Steps, heartrate, and sleep monitoring are the important ones, but I also wanted something that was minimalistic in appearance, preferably without a big, bright face. Sometimes I wear a watch, so I didn't want to look like I'm wearing two watches. This part was surprisingly difficult to find. I also was looking for a device that doesn't have a subscription, as I think it is silly to pay an additional price to see data that the device is already collecting.Then I see the Halo. It almost fit my wants 100%, save for the subscription. But it comes with 6 months free, so I thought it might be worth checking out. What actually sold me on the device was the touted ability to track emotion and tone using the voice recognition. This seemed like a great feature, and so I pulled the trigger.Alas, I have been wearing my Halo for a couple of weeks now. Having used it and reviewed the data daily, my biggest conclusion is that data collection is inconsistent. Now, as far as steps and heart rate go, I believe it to be fairly accurate. I don't have another device to compare it to, but the step counts seem to align with my activity, and the heart rate monitor captures moments of activity and my workouts without me prompting it to do so. The biggest glare, though, is sleep tracking. It simply doesn't work. First thing, it simply won't save any sleep data unless it detects that you have slept for 3 or more hours. So, don't count on it tracking any naps. And if you are a light sleeper or find yourself getting up once or twice in the middle of the night, a good portion of your sleep activity simply won't get captured. And there doesn't seem to be anything you can do about it. Now, if there was a setting that you could configure to tell the device to capture and save all sleep related data between certain hours, I think this would fix the problem. But this feature doesn't exist. So, most nights, the Halo thinks I only sleep for 3-4 hours, and many nights it doesn't capture any sleep data at all.The Tone feature isn't much better. According to the data, I don't talk most of the day. Now, that isn't to say that it isn't capturing any data, because it will pick up on moments of excitement, happiness, or even anger. This may have to do with the settings of Tone. Tone sampling can be set to ""Less Tone"" or ""More Tone"". Additionally, you can set a daily schedule, so that the Halo isn't trying to sample while you are sleeping. These settings are to help preserve battery life. Currently, I have sampling set to ""Less Tone"" on a 9am to 5pm schedule. With this, my battery typically lasts about 2.5 days before I need to charge. I imagine setting the sampling rate higher would drastically decrease battery life, so I'm not willing to set it that way. In fact, I'm thinking of disabling Tone sampling all together, since it isn't all that useful. I was also hoping that I would get real time notifications when Halo detects elevated Tone levels. This would be really useful if a person's tone became angry or agitated. A simple buzz on your phone or the device itself might be enough to get a person to become more mindful in the moment.In all, the Halo just doesn't quite meet my needs 100%. Given this is a fairly new product on the market, I'm willing to give it a few more months of use, at least until I have to start paying for the subscription. I've already submitted feedback to Amazon, and I hope they can do some things on the firmware and software side of things to get this device working the way it is advertised to.",2
90,Love my halo but look what happened!! I've returned once about a year ago for not charging & it was replaced fast & easy. Then this happened this morning. Don't know how to proceed.?,4
91,"I want to love the Halo. It has some nice features. I like that it doesn't have a display screen so it's not drawing your attention to look at data all the time (though that's also a drawback, as mentioned below). I like the sleep tracking, which seems to be pretty accurate. I like the heartrate tracking, which seems to be accurate with both me and my husband. We haven't used the BMI calculator, nor have we used it to analyze our tone of voice. My husband is the primary user of the device, though I've grabbed it from him for a few days/nights just to see if I like it.The problems that I'm seeing are, relatively speaking, fairly small. But they're also fairly annoying.1. Without checking the app, when the band is synced, you don't have the slightest idea of how much power is left before you need to recharge.  Since we're using the ""family cell phone"" (husband is primarily wearing the device, and his cell is issued by his employer and cannot have apps like this installed on it), the device is only synced in the evenings, mornings, or when we think about it.  I do realize that most people would be installing it on their own phone, not a shared cell, but I'm sure I'm not the only person who deals with a company-issued cell that can't have random apps installed.2.  In relation to #1 above, since we have the Halo app on a phone that is not constantly in the wearer's pocket, it's hard to spot-check things like heart rate and exercise points for the day.3.  As mentioned in prior reviews, your goal is 150 points of activity for the week.  Getting less logged activity in a day during the week will take away points, which is really disappointing and in no way feels encouraging. I understand the concept (you're negating all your good hard work) but that's not entirely accurate, and really doesn't give you much encouragement to work super hard the following day. Working a 12 hour day at a desk, or even being sick and less active one day, will mess up your activity tracking for the week. Kind of feels like being punished for working hard to support your family. But maybe that's just me. I earned my ""gold star"" by working hard over the weekend. Taking it back on a long workday Monday feels like punishment.4.  No display screen on the Halo is both good and bad. The bad part is that when you're out exercising, running around the block or whatever your exercise of choice is, you have to get your phone, enter the app, and then see what your heart rate is.  Taking your phone in and out of your pocket, unlocking the phone, and going in and out of an app during a workout, is a real pain.  I'm sure that keeps the price down, but be aware that you're definitely giving up some convenience by not having a display screen, even with the most basic information on it.Overall, I like the Halo, but it just feels like a starter fitness tracker to me. It has promise, but needs a little more work and maybe some different options (display screen option). Overall, I like it, but I just don't love it.",3
92,"I got this as an early release. The body scan feature is really cool. I like seeing the 3D model of my body bc it's difficult to get that perspective otherwise. I've never owned a step counter before so I don't have anything to compare that feature to. It's fine. I like the heart rate tracking and seeing how that varies throughout the day.The two things I'm disappointed by are sleep tracking and voice recording. First, let me assure you I read all the info in detail and followed all troubleshooting steps when I needed to. I am not making any obvious mistakes. When it comes to voice analysis, I find it pretty much useless. Every convo is pretty much unique, so it's hard to extrapolate. I guess if you're a lecturer or a radio host maybe it would be useful. But the data points are disperse and all you see is a bar chart with bits of info about phrases here and there, which is not enough info to be useful. I have no idea what I said at 2:28 p.m. that could have been construed as ""restrained."" And even if I did, who's to say that wasn't warranted in that specific convo? I feel like you would have to have a serious amount of self-loathing to think you use your voice incorrectly. The first thought I had when I read about this feature is that it would be good for someone with Asperger's or Autism, or any situation where one's voice is so distinct and has deficits 2 or 3 standard deviations from the mean. Otherwise, who cares if I sounded a little happier or sadder than usual? What am I going to do? Attempt to add 10% more happiness to my voice the next time I start talking about something positive?When it comes to sleep tracking, I simply don't believe what the app says. The suggested sleep score you want to target is 85. In the five months I've used the band, I have never scored above 66. Last month my average was 33. I move a lot at night, but the app is telling me that I am spending 2 or 3 hours awake every night, in the middle of the night, and that is simply not happening. The only thing I can think is maybe something isn't calibrated properly or I am sleeping on the band. But that's how I sleep, with my arm under a pillow or wrapped around my body in a sort of ""hug."" I doubt that's unusual. I can't exactly purposefully keep my hand in one position all night. Anyway, I don't trust the sleep tracker at all. Maybe I got a dud.Couple other things: it has to be recharged at least once a day, even if you turn the voice feature to ""low,"" which is supposed to save battery. Also, the band itself is not great. I got the synthetic fabric one. The fabric is coming unknit around the velcro area, just from me putting it on and off. The band is also stretching out badly so that it doesn't fit my wrist like it used to, and the excess band gets caught on clothing a lot. It also traps sweat and starts to smell, so I have to soak it in a mild disinfectant about once a month.One last thing, over the last couple weeks the app has been very slow. It responds to finger presses with a couple seconds' delay. Very frustrating.",3
93,"I  pre-ordered it and have used it since it came out. I have read reviews from people that say its demotivating, I find that is not true at all. If you can only get a couple points per day then I hate to point out, that's why you are having obesity issues. I completely understand it is difficult to change your lifestyle and get up more and walk around.  But to ask for a kinder gentler device to not hurt your feelings is just silly. We all know when we are overweight and unhealthy and have to accept it before we can change ourselves permanently. I find the device very useful to motivate me to move and its accurate. Yes, it will take points away from you if you are sedentary 18 hours a day, but that is how it should be! Thank about it. You can't sit all day long and then work out for 30 minutes and expect your body/mind to change. So please don't get discouraged if you see points go away. You can totally do 150 points per week I swear! Its small changes and they can add up. I have been getting the points and haven't been walking or working out lately because of an back injury. I have a standing desk at work and do the stairs. I play in my yard with my kids and the occasional walk in the neighborhood. So you can do it! The BMI part is eye opening and no you don't do it naked! It states to put shorts and a top on. It is nice to have the pictures to see the changes in yourself. It is amazing to visually see changes like that.  You have to see yourself in order to change.  I don't use the voice, so I cant comment on that. I like that there isn't a screen and it looks more like a bracelet. That's why I got it. I feel that if you are on your device so much that you have to be reading texts on your watch it may be a reason why people aren't moving as much. It would be cool to be able to push a button and see the time through the fabric, but that is all I can think would be useful. I haven't had any issues with it. The fabric is easy to clean.  You also have the choice of doing workouts they provide on the app. They are included and there are so many choices (barre, HIIT, Yoga, 15 min quick workouts, etc.). There is a ""Live"" function to watch my heartrate as I workout as well. Now I can tell if I am being lazy during a session , haha. The sleep functions have been eye-opening to see how many times I wake all night and that I needed to get more sleep. All in all I have enjoyed it and it has been useful to me. Very easy to use and simple. Customer service was great when I had questions on how they calculate Intense activity for points. Make sure you try it for several weeks for it to get readings off you. It builds off the previous data and works better. Don't be like Chad and give up after two days.",5
94,"I bought to track sleep and activityIf you don’t sleep in regular cycles,it does not log, it only logs one sleep period per nightIt will not even log sleep reasonably in the one period without monthly chargeOutdated product and overpriced service",4
95,"I've used a number of fitness trackers and watches over the years. From Fitbit to Apple Watches and now I wanted to give the Halo Band a try.Overall, it's a great band for the money. It tracks steps pretty accurately as well as heart rate from my tracking of other bands.The one thing that I know it doesn't do as well or factor in for some reason, is heart rate while sleeping. Maybe it's a setting that can be turned off but I haven't found it. It makes no sense to me because it has a heart rate monitor built in.Fitbit and Apple both factor in HR to how they calculate your restfulness and it's a huge factor that is missed.A perfect example is if you have ever tracked your sleep and have had a drink, you'll see that your RHR will be higher than if you didn't have a drink. My RHR without even one drink is 45-50 bpm and when I do have a drink it varies between 65-75 bpm. It's a major miss in my opinion and factors into your overall recovery at night.I think that if they update the device to allow heart rate tracking while sleeping it will get a 5 star review.Overall, it's a great device.",4
96,"I purchased the Halo in November 2020.  For the first few months the battery life was barely 24 hours.  Then Amazon noticed and sent me new Halo.  Now the battery life is 3-4 days.  I do not use the Voice Recognition.  I tried it.  At the end of my day, I would pull up the report.  It told me how I sounded at certain times throughout my day.  But I found my memory of exactly who I was talking to and what we were talking about at that exact time of day was lacking, so it wasn't very helpful for me when it said I sounded angry.  If I could change it to meet my needs, I would need a playback or dialog text of what I said.  But that requires real-time recording, which I cannot do throughout my day for all my conversations.  So I turned that feature off.  I've dabble with the labs, but have not yet found the need to delve deeply into them.  I don't usually have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.  I played with those labs a little, but found I didn't need them.  I have not found much need yet to use a fitness lab, as I have enough outside of Halo to keep me active.  I do love the activity tracking, the sleep tracking, and the body scans.  I like that it does not bother me during my day with reminders, as I am working and can only get up at certain times.  I recently lost my phone and I am finding myself going crazy not knowing how many activity points I've racked up or how well I slept last night.  It does motivate me to get active- I like to try to beat my own high scores. I find myself trying to get to bed on time to maximize my sleep score.  I have lost over 40 lbs since August 2020 and Halo has played a part in helping me to accomplish my goal.  I bought one for husband and it's got him moving more and caring more about the quality of his sleep too.  I do use another Health app on my phone when I run to track my speed and distance- it talks to me during my run.  I also use a smart scale with an app to track my size, weight, BMI and many other physical metrics.  Therefore I have not given Halo 5 stars as it is not the end all be all of fitness/sleep trackers and I don't use all the features.  I do not have another smart wrist device.  I only wear Halo.",4
97,"I ordered the Halo band because I wanted a fitness tracker, but preferred one that didn't have a digital display.  I have a nice ""dumb"" watch that was a gift that I prefer to wear to keep time, so I go the Halo band to wear on the opposite wrist.  It was easy enough to set up, and I like the look of it and the fit.  Battery life was pretty good, I only had to charge every 3 or 4 days at most.I have worn it every day (minus charging periods of course) for a month.  I'm no longer going to continue wearing it for a few reasons.  Here's why:1.  The movement tracking seems WAY off.  Example - a few days after setting up the band I wore it while mowing the lawn.  I don't have a huge lawn, but it's 1/2 acre to cut and takes me close to 1.5 - 2 hrs each time.  First time I wore the band I went into the app and set it to track the activity live, and since I didn't really know what I was doing I set it as ""yardwork"".  Set off to cutting the grass and after I finished the Halo band tracked that I had a total of a 149 steps.  Using a push mower.  A few weeks later I cut the grass a 2nd time and thought maybe the Halo band thought ""yardwork"" meant I was stationary planting bulbs or something (not sure it wouldn't still count my steps) so this time I set me activity as ""walking"".  After cutting the entire lawn again I had accumulated a less than 1,000 steps.  I also had my iPhone in my pocket during the same time and it counted close to 9,000 steps in the same time.  Of course I don't expect them to match exactly, but c'mon - Halo wasn't even remotely closely.2.  Sleep - One of the biggest reasons I wanted a tracker like the Halo was of the sleep tracking capability.  However if I were to believe the data it provides I basically never sleep.  According the info I receive I never get ""restful"" sleep and the majority of my nights are ""disturbances"" during which time I am awake.  Who knows, maybe I am, but I sure don't feel that way.  I feel rested enough and frankly just don't believe the data that Halo is providing.3.  Activity - Getting points for the activity metric on Halo might be the most frustrating thing.  I'm not a super fitness junkie, but I'm not a slug either...  but not once did I meet any ""goal"" that Halo had set for me.  I'm sure that's all on me, so take that as you will, but it is a bit disheartening to feel like you're not getting anywhere.Halo might work for some folks, I dunno.  For me it just didn't seem to be accurate in anything it was supposed to be tracking.",2
98,"I like the point system, allowing me to feel like I’ve met my goals for a week, even if I had one slow day. It encourages me to be more active, and not just focus on steps. So far, the Halo Band has a lot of promise for being a decent whole health tracker. I like having something that’s a bracelet, so I can still wear a watch.A few things that would be nice to incorporate in future releases:- Haptics on the band, so I can be notified if I have been sedentary for a specific length of time and need to move- A more intuitive app interface (like, say, a dashboard view) and a way to see more fine grained graphs.- On the app, a way to edit a dashboard to view the stats I care about most at a glance.- A widget for the iPhone, as another way to quickly check stats.- This is a stretch… but being able to connect to the apple health app would be great.- A slimmer design for the band, so it looks more like a bracelet, and less like a fitness tracker.",4
99,I really like the Halo and the features. This is my second one as Amazon emailed letting me know they were sending a new one as they noticed mine was not working correctly and it was not. I had stopped wearing it. I also started getting pain in my wrist which was another reason I stopped wearing it. The new one was great and working better in the app but I’m still experiencing pain in my wrist. I have to stop wearing it as I am not sure what the pain is from. The pain is not from wearing too tight or too lose. I get the pain in the area of the green light.,4
100,"I loved my halo.  I excitedly awaited its release.  I remember being crushed when I missed my first invite and it expired 12 hours before I noticed it.  I immediately requested another invitation.  I celebrated with joy when I got that second invite and made an immediate purchase. Any criticism that was launched at halos by tech writers or other reviewers, I batted away. I was a halo defender!  For the price point, it was an amazing device that shouldn't be compared to more expensive trackers and it had technology that wasn't completely comparable.  This in an inexpensive, first generation tracker.  I didn't expect it to be perfect and I was willing to invest the time into it and Amazon to get it there--just as I have done for my kindles, echoes, etc.  I loved that it didn't distract me with a screen and that my data was on my phone when I wanted to look at it.  It tracked meaningful data and compiled it in a thoughtful way on a good platform.  At first, it didn't do a perfect job tracking my activity, but it got smarter as I would input activities manually on the app.  Before too long, it was tracking my activities very well all on its own.  The critics who complain that the body scan is invasive puzzle me.  If you have ever worn a swimsuit in public, you have let the world see what your halo needs to in order to do its calculation.So why the change of heart?Two months and ten days into our relationship, it broke.  The backplate that covers the scanner is affixed with a little ring of adhesive.  I guess that little ring of black goo couldn't keep up with the bathing and sweaty exercise it was subjected to, but that was the whole point of the halo.  I was supposed to wear it everywhere, all the time. ""No problem,"" I thought, ""I'll just contact Amazon because their customer service is great."" I decided against using my Squaretrade coverage because this was clearly a manufacturing problem.  Customer service offered me a refund.  I asked for a replacement.  Nope, they couldn't do it.  A refund!  So now if I want to give a halo another chance, I would have to pay a higher price than the introduction rate I paid and wait 4-6 weeks for another device.  My extra halo bands have no purpose. They sit in my nightstand drawer as a reminder of this broken relationship that I believed would be long-lasting and would go places.My husband's halo is still alive and kicking.  I did get mine before he got his, because yes, my halo enthusiasm converted his inner skeptic into a believer.  He offered to give me his.  I have rejected this kind gesture because it doesn't feel right to take his away from him.  But for now in our home, there are no more sleep comparisons to be had.  No more activity score competitions or discussions.  My wrist is empty.Update: Husband’s halo is still working. Customer service figured out how to send me a replacement instead of a refund (which is what I wanted). So I’m giving halo another try and I’m hopeful.",3
101,"I really wanted to like this product. I love the look of the Halo. I LOVE that it was no screen because I don’t want that distraction. And I have had no issues with it’s comfort or with the laser they use to track and measure heart rate (which BTW is the same as you’d get with like an Apple Watch).The issue I have is the inconsistency of tracking, especially with sleep. What prompted me to review this today is the fact that I got the best sleep I’ve gotten in a while last night, and the halo is still telling me I slept poorly and that I was awake for the first half of the night. That’s not true, but it’s a common occurrence with halo.I also have had numerous instances where it doesn’t track my workouts properly, and therefore doesn’t give me the points it should be giving me for my work out.I’ve read enough reviews at this point to know that Amazon is going to simply reply and say that we need to make sure we’re wearing the bracelet properly, but Amazon…if this bracelet is meant to ENCOURAGE ACTIVITY, the bracelet is going to move! It’s not going to stay perfectly locked into that sweet spot all the time without cinching the bracelet down to the point of discomfort.Lastly, someone commented that the app is demotivating and I don’t disagree. You have no ability to turn on or off the recommendations that they’re sending you, so basically the app wants you to be perfect and if you’re not it tells you that you’re not. And that is highly demotivating. If my goal is to purely use the app to track my movement, why do I need to get the rest of these notifications? And yet I have no ability to turn them off. It constantly makes me feel like I’m not doing enough and I don’t like that.Also - as many have stated, NO you do not have to be naked for the body scan. Shorts and a sports bra and your good. That’s actually something that I really like about the app. But there IS a lot not to like.I have a friend who is upgrading their Apple Watch and will be giving me their old one. Thank god cuz I’m not willing to pay that much for something that I just want to use to track activity. So the Halo Is my option in the meantime but I likely will be switching.Amazon, my recommendation is to work out the tweaks in the inaccuracy of tracking for workout and sleep, how finicky the Watch is with frequently disconnecting from the app, and make it so that it doesn’t have such a limited range of positions on someone’s wrist where it actually functions properly.",3
102,"I love trying new things out so when I got an invitation to purchase the Amazon Halo, I purchased it right away.  For one thing, my Gen 1 Apple Watch is on it’s last leg and my Fitbit has already died, so I was ready to get something else a shot for the fitness tracking.  My first thoughts were of how simple the design is.  The is basically 1 button on it and no display.  I thought I would miss having a display but I don’t.  There is so much information when you log into the app and that is so easy, there’s really no need for lights and displays on your wrist.  Also, I use the sleep tracking on it since the battery life is so good and last for several days and nights at a time, so I would think a display or lights coming on or blinking would bother my sleep.  The band itself is comfortable.  I have it on my right wrist as I still my watch on my leaf.  This was easier than I thought to get used to being that I’m right handed.  The app tracks activity on a points system which explains simply.  Points are based on the intensity of activity and it will deduct points for being too sedentary.  The app shows your weekly points balance at a glance a well as your sleep score.  You can click on these and get more details about them.  There are also what the app calls Labs, They are structured videos or audio or some are even self tracked that focus on activity, sleep, tone etc. I have not yet tried the Tone feature which is supposed to assess how you sound to those around you.  (Frankly, I’m a little scared it might tell me I always sound stressed or something)  I started with some Foundational programs like walking every morning before noon for at least fifteen minutes.  The band tracks this activity automatically as well as steps taken.  I have also tried a couple workout Labs.  I am out of shape but honestly this ia pushing me and helping me to stick with it.  I think the Weekly Activity Stats is more motivating than the Daily on other fitness trackers.  It’s easy to get discouraged if you aren’t hitting your daily goals each day, but with a weekly  goal, it seem less discouraging each day if that makes sense.  If you have a lazy or bad day it doesn’t ruin your mindset nor your whole week score. I just started a Beginners Yoga Lab.  It’s detailed videos that you follow and it seems pretty good for a beginner like myself. There’s also labs for your mindset like meditation and such.  I am really enjoying everything about the app and tracking so far.  There’s a Body section as well that will do a scan from directed photos you take.  It will calculate your Body Fat Percentage from the scans and info you provide.  You can check your live heart rate while in the app.  I am enjoying this band so far and getting a little more motivated each day.",5
103,"Let me start off by saying that I am a wearable tech junkie.Also a beauty product junkie, but that’s not this review. Back to the Halo, I think this wearable does everything it says it was going to do and that’s why I almost gave it 5 stars. I was able to get in early on the waitlist for the and purchased as soon as I received the email, so the price point was very reasonable. I was interested to try out the tone, BMI, and temperature tracking options that most the more expensive wearables out there hadn’t provided to me yet. The Halo was spot on with a fever I had being above my normal baseline (not Covid, whew). The body scan function was a not so subtle reminder that I do in fact need to lose body fat, and I continue to scan every couple of weeks or so to track progress. I agree with some others comments that the Halo doesn’t really provide extra motivation to work out…You’ve got to want it, and I want my BMI to go down! There is a slider tool on the app that projects what you may look like with a certain body fat % which I believe helps to remove any misconception you have about your own body shape and what it can do, if that makes sense.The tone function was interesting but reiterated the fact that I’m annoyed when I talk to people from work and I am amused when I talk to my daughter or son.My favorite thing about the Halo is the detailed sleep analysis and the various labs you can do to meditate because I need to reduce stress in my life, and also, the body scan.My least favorite thing about the Halo and why I don’t wear it exclusively is that I am lifelong watch wearer so I do want to see the time and I guess all of the other distractions that come with a bigger smart watch. I wear another tracker (Apple Watch) during the day for that.Including a few pics regarding the band—love the pink band but it does pick up dirt more easily than the darker ones and it is in a size large. I went ahead and purchased the denim in a medium because the large was on back order for like six months and I can’t wait for things like that. Also purchased the silicone lavender and that was so flimsy and big…I just didn’t like it and returned it.For comparison purposes, attaching these pics as well so you can see size difference. My wrist is 7 1/2 inches at this point.",4
104,"I love this device , it has motivated me to exercise  more and it hold me accountable for all of the time that I am sedentary. One of the best features about this fit tracker that I love is what it doesn't have; a watch. I like to work a nice analogue watch for my job and I thought it would look ridiculous if I wore one along with a fitness tracker that had a digital display of the time. This device almost looks like a wrist band or a bracelet and discreet.Another; thing that I love about it is that it is super lightweight, sometimes I have to look because I think that I forgot to put it on.However, all of those benefits wouldn't matter if it didn't do what it promises to do which is keep track of your fitness activity. Like other reviewers have stated, it does keep track of the minutes that you are moving around and it does use a base of 150 minutes per week as a minimum because that is what the national heart association recommends . And like other reviewers have mentioned it does take away points from your weekly total if you are sedentary for more than 8 hours a day.  However, I don't see the problem here. A fit tracker is supposed to keep you keep track of how much you move so I don't see what the problem is. You can also earn points by doing chores or just going for simple walks, if you aren't earning enough points to meet the  minimum , that should be a message about your exercise habits..Another bonus of the Halo is the app that you can download on your phone. Using the app is how you will keep track of your fitness scores and other dates.  It offers you a ton of different workout videos and nutrition apps to keep you motivated. The first 6 months are free and then after that there is a $ 5 a month fee but I think that it is well worth it.The app also has a great feature which measures your weekly progress and compares it to past weeks.Finally, I would like to comment on the sleep and the voice recognition features. The sleep is ok , it monitors your sleep and keeps track of how long it takes you to fall sleep and the quality of your sleep. It is nice to have but I really don't the information to any use. I suppose that someone interested in those statistics could probably use them for something.I don't use the voice recognition or ""tone"" function. I have it permanently shut off because I don't like the fact that it can listen to my conversations. I also hear that it drains the battery so I don't use it all .So to sum up, it is a nice fit tracker that will probably motivate you to work out longer and harder and can make you a healthier and fitter person.",5
105,"Short version: I was looking for a ""holistic"" fitness tracker to compliment my Samsung Gear Sport (circa 2017). For the first 2 months the Halo worked well. But then my initial Halo Band failed after 3 months (wouldn't charge), the replacement/refurbished unit worked for four months and then wouldn't charge, lastly Amazon lost the third replacement in transit (they gave me a full refund for my original order so no complaints on that). Needless to say, I'm not going 4-for-4.BTW - I treated this thing quite well. It never fell, got banged into weights, or partly consumed by my dog. It just quit working. Twice!Long version:Why are you still reading? This Halo band ain't great... but if you decide to give it a try despite my negative review here is what's good:1. I wanted a ""holistic"" fitness tracker to go with my exercise of choice (running). The Samsung Watch is durable and saw me through training for races from 10k to a marathon but I wanted more info on my sleep, strength building, and general fitness. Hence, I bought the Halo.2. The app is easy to use and intuitive. I checked it frequently through the day to monitor sedentary activity.3. The sleep tracking felt valuable and generally accurate. I liked how it split deep sleep, REM, and light sleep.4. The exercise options! I loved that... you could do a routine and not only would Halo track the points but also record the data in your app (meaning, it knew you did a cardio vs. weights vs. stretches)5. The movement assessment rocked too.What wasn't good (other than hardware fails)1. I am not buying the body scan data. Look, I'm a reasonably healthy and active male in my late 40s (5'11 165). The body scan told me I've got 28% body fat which... may be true? But uh... probably isn't? I know Amazon made a big deal about its accuracy (with a study they paid for) but if you have ANY body issues DO NOT USE THIS THING! DO NOT BUY IT! Seriously... it will cause stress.2. The tone feature? Meh. I used in Halo Band #1 and found it generally accurate but not useful.3. You really are not getting that impressive of a health tracker (beyond the poor quality) - it basically measures a few things that other devices have been for some time. The App, and Amazon's ability to churn data, are impressive but the actual sensors are on-par with a Microsoft Band from the early 2010s (yes, I had one so I know :)4. Ok, so this is really weird but I wanted to cast the exercise videos from my phone to a t.v. I *could not* do that via an Amazon Fire stick. You'd think there would be an option (maybe I missed it?) but I could use my Android phone to cast to a Chromecast and see the video on the screen. Odd that Amazon didn't do the integration with their own product.Bottom line - There are many, many, many other options out there. The concept is right with the app, but the actual band is sub-par compared to... well any name-brand fitness device out there. The body image scan feels dodgy (based on my height, weight, and last physical). By way of comparison, my Samsung watch from 2017 is still going strong. I've worn that swimming, playing sports, running (lots), and its been banged into any number of things (weights in the pre-pandemic era). Its almost as pristine as when I opened the box. It doesn't track all the goodies the Halo app does but... its newer versions mostly do. I like what Amazon is trying here--building a holistic health tracker--but build quality ultimately fails it.",2
106,"I really like this fitness band! I have used a lot of different trackers and bands and I must say by far, this is my favorite. The band itself feels nicely made and doesn't feel cheap. The system they used to keep the band on looks like Velcro but doesn't feel like normal Velcro, at least to me. Either way, its soft and it stays on even when sleeping. It's comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. I have only been taking mine off to charge it, which doesn't take long. I have mine monitoring my tone of voice so I average about a day and half before it needs charged again. Battery life will differ depending on how many settings you use and have activated.This band doesn't have a screen, which I didn't know how I would feel about it at first. However, after using it for a long while I really enjoy it. I am not constantly looking at it and I don't have something lighting up distracting me from my day to day activities. In my opinion, this is not a negative at all.The band measures a lot of the normal vitals but also does tone of voice and even body scans with the app. Throughout the day the band will record your voice and analyze it and try to determine if it was angry, moderate, or happy. It's actually quite comical and I like looking back on my day to see how I sound to others. How accurate it is, I can't say for sure, but it's a really neat concept that I am sure will get better over time. The body scan feature can be a little different and might be a little scary to some. You have to be down to your underwear or have tight clothing on for it work properly. It essentially takes picture of your body and uses them to analyze body fat. This is all done by machine so they say no human ever sees the photos. You don't have to use either these 2 features if you don't want to - so no worries.The app itself is nicely setup and pretty easy to use. They really give you a lot of information and even a good bit of work outs and tasks you can do based on your specific weight and vitals.All in all, I really like this fitness tracker and literally it is just that. No texts, no notifications, no useless distractions. It might not be for everyone, but for me, I really like it and would highly recommend giving it a chance. It will only get better over time. If I had to find 1 fault with this, it would be the price of the accessories and extra bands. I don't think they need to be that expensive. Not a deal breaker, but just something to point out.",5
107,"I want to start off by saying that I didn't use all the features of this product in part because I wasn't interested. I am a fitness enthusiast and focused on fitness and sleep tracking. I was excited to try this product because it seemed like the WHOOP band, which I had been debating buying. Maybe it was my high expectations that let me down rather quickly.I did enjoy the fact that it didn't have a screen. I don't like the distractions so that part of the device was great!The BandThis is probably the biggest reason I want to return this because no matter how hard I tried, getting the smell out of the band was the hardest thing. Because I primarily used this product for fitness tracking I would sweat and soon realized how bad the band smelled. I tried washing after workouts, putting it in the washer but within the next use or two the band would smell again. I attempted to look for bands for this product but Amazon didn't have any and I don't think any other retailer matches the design. I see them now but I'm already over it.Heart Rate and Fitness TrackingAs long as I was wearing the device consistently, I think it did a pretty good job of recording my activity. After the band started smelling, I stopped wearing the band as frequently so tracking my activity was off, which wasn't  that big of a deal to me because my initial lust had worn off and I was pretty sure I was returning it. Heart rate was also spot on given what I already knew about my heart rate.SleepI didn't like the sleep tracker. I have insomnia, which the tracker is not as keen on picking up. Sometimes I would have a day where I would sleep for 2 hours be up for 2-3 hours and go back to sleep for another 2 or so hours and then I would check in the morning and there would be no data. I emailed my feedback to the Halo team and the information wasn't helpful because the same thing kept happening. I also felt that they should pick up naps as sleep tracking instead of sedentary time but as of my last use at the end of December 2020 that was not a thing.I did like that it told me about which stage of sleep I was in when and the percentage of time I spent in them. It gave me some relief for my insomnia.Fitness FeaturesI tried one of the fitness app videos to see what it would be with. I took the one with Russell Wilson because it was one of the most advanced workouts. It felt more of warm up than anything else because they did a lot of talking. It was not on the scale of Nike Training Club, Peloton, or any of the well-respected fitness apps.Tone and Body ScanI didn't use these two features because I could care less about it telling me about my tone. I also tend to be aware of how I sound when. I actually don't understand why anyone would be interested in this feature. I also have a scale that does body analysis so I didn't need this one.",3
108,"I have had this about a month and like it bordering on loving it.  If you read that someone says that it is harsh or provides a disincentive to work out, ignore that (I will explain later).  If you read that the the app is too passive and crashes, believe it.  If you buy the band, wear it, and install the app and never open the app, then your life is never changed one bit.  The app never alerts me to anything, reminds me about anything, encourages me when I'm close, or tells me I'm doing a great job until I open it up and wade through the insipid ""insight"" stuff to get the meat and potatoes myself.  The most it does is draw a circle and some rays jump out after I make the goal.  If you are lazy and want something to give you a participation trophy for doing ""something,"" then you are out of luck.  If your heart ain't registering a workout, then the Halo scoffs at it.  You can bust your a$$ on Monday and get your points for working hard.  But if you slack off during your workout, it knows.  And if you do nothing else the rest of the week you LOSE POINTS!  Consistency in exercise is the key.  If you are discouraged because you have to really work your heart out (literally) every day, then you should send this back for refund and contact your local funeral home to pre-plan.  If you ever wondered if your Peloton was worth the hype, wear this on a ride and see how the points just roll in.  But cardio is not all that if you don't want to be fat.  You gotta ""move"" and Halo got you covered with that as well.  I'm just getting into their workouts because I have my own workouts to ignore before I get to ignoring theirs.  The Halo does not automatically detect Peloton and weights, but when I tell it to add the activity, it looks back at my heart rate and *bam* points added!  Real time heart rate, average resting heart rate (good indicator of overall health and overtraining), body fat percentage calculated by some AI peeping Tom (I'm a guy so I don't really care but you can ignore this feature if you do), sleep statistics, and steps if you are in to that.  If you want a eWatch, then this is not for you.  The band is completely passive, so the value is all through the app.  I can see in the mirror that I have lost a lot of ground during 2020, so I don't need an app with artificial intelligence for that.  This gadget helps me hold myself accountable to engage in a USEFUL workout and not just slacking around pretending to work out.  If you are not getting more fit, you are getting less fit.  We hardly ever sit in the middle.",5
109,"When I first heard about this device, I was super excited. I put myself on the waiting list and when it came time (after  a couple months), I bought it (November). I know I put three stars and as it continues to improve, The rating will probably go up. As of now, it’s average.Pros- it has no issues tracking my steps- It tracks my sleep and gives me a little bit more extra data (like my sleep efficiency in my sleep temperature)- The Voice analyzer- has helped me give me more insight as to how I sound to others- The no time... at first it bugged me, but then I got used to not looking at my wrist to look at the time all the time- Like how the band is cloth... The rubber bands or whatever that came with a Fitbit‘s and stuff, they irritate my skin- Battery on average lasts a while... typically 4 to 6 days. Usually I just re-charge it when I’m in the shower or bath. Charging is quick too- I enjoy the activity pointsCould be betters- when analyzing your voice, it eats the battery- I’m not sure if the heart rate is 100% accurate. During my workouts, I wear a heart monitor band... and it shows some high heart rates, but the halo doesn’t seem to catch them- The labs are neat idea, but they could be a little bit more personalizedCons- I thought the body fat analysis is when they advertise it was similar to like the scales shooting something through your body and what not. So when I got it, I was super disappointed. You take photos of your body and supposedly the program does it accurate. However, you have to be in the right lighting and your phone has to be in the right position (I tried it out different ways and I got different readings each time). Even then, they take you weight and height.  I can understand the height, but not so much the weight. Muscles weigh more than fat. Comparing it to my in body results from the gym, for example.... it was showing that my lean mass was lower by almost 8 pounds and almost 4pds more for fat mass compared to my InBody results. So accuracy of this is questionable at best.- It only connects to the WW and the John Hancock Vitality app. Seriously? So it can connect to obscure health apps, but not the more common ones that everyone has.- Initial initial set up can be a pain in the ass- The charger is weird and can be a pain. You have to make sure it’s connected to the pins, otherwise it won’t charge- Doesn’t detect all activities (ie workouts)Improvements- Connectivity to more apps- If the Apple Watch can test the oxygen levels, this should be able to too. Especially if it can take your skin temperature at night and analyze your tone- Change the charger- Improve on the body scan- Make the labs more personalized- Show us what we can do with our data to become better at life",3
110,"As I’ve been using the band for a few months, I thought it might be well to do a review:The good:The measure of activity is quite excellent. The different levels of activity and then assigning them values, is really helpful and having the previous values (amount of activity) from previous weeks allows for a nice self-competition and overall progressive mindset.The band is actually quite comfortable, moreso than other biometric bands that I’ve tried, I have actually forgotten that I had it on, and I can’t say that with others.Although I haven’t done any of them, the little videos with the trainers seem really well done. I am already invested in Supernatural (oculus/VR), so don’t really utilize the videos, but I like that they are available.The bad:Sleep is hit and miss, and recently been more of a miss. This was actually the initial impulse and the reason that I was okay with subscription model. It will not log your sleep in and tell you that you’ve slept a few hours when you’ve had a full nights sleep, as well as giving you blocks of time when it sensed you up and about, when you were not (unless I’m sleepwalking, so who knows??). Overall this has been disappointing.Tone is a total waste of time. It just gives very vague ‘you sounded happy’, which is useless for me. I liked how they managed privacy with this and was actually hopeful as I work with some challenging clients and would like some feedback (more than vague assurances) relative to how I sound. Frankly, I’m surprised they even put that as a function given how clunky it is.I haven’t done the body caliper, no particular reason, it’s just not something that I’m interested in, though I could understand the value.Overall, if I was to buy it again, I probably would if only for the activity progressive opportunity (and seeing heart rate in realtime, though all of the bands, even the crappy ones do that). If you are desiring this for any other metric, I would say look elsewhere.Given that it’s a subscription model, one is hopeful that there will be improvements, we’ll see, thusfar I haven’t seen any updates that would give a better experience.",3
111,"UPDATE: (06/24/2021)I lowered this to one star. This band continues to be getting worse regarding reading my activity level. I am now getting ridiculous Activity readings much more frequently. Still reporting INTENSE activity when I am not doing ANYTHING remotely strenuous. I could walk to my mailbox and this thing would think I ran a marathon. Again, this band worked fine for about 6 months and now it’s essentially useless if it isn’t reading my activity and heart rate accurately. I was surprised to receive a call back from an Amazon representative but nothing came of it. Said they would send me a link to call if I encountered further problems relating to this situation but all they sent was there stand customer service number. Sorry, but that really isn’t helpful. Not impressed. Cancelled my Halo subscription early and sticking to my Fitbit. Wasted my money on this one.(Original Post)I’ve had the band for about 6 months. I used to wear a Fitbit but because of work regulations I was not allowed to wear any smart watch or fitness band that had a screen or gave out notifications and alerts due to my job being a safety critical role. I had to give up the Fitbit but was very interested in trying out this band as it would allow me to track my health statistics without being intrusive in any way. I like the look and feel of the band. It’s almost as if I’m not wearing anything on my wrist at all. The charging cuff is terrible. It doesn’t seem to connect well and I am having to move the band around on the cuff to get a connection and often times it just loses the connection while it’s charging. Even if I disconnect the hardware from the actual fabric band it doesn’t seem to connect well.I never cared for the app. It doesn’t seem intuitive to me and I’ve had trouble finding the information I am looking for. I’m used to using the Fitbit app so I acknowledge that being used to that may cloud my judgment on the Halo app.IMHO the Halo seems to be geared more towards a female audience. Not really impressed with any of the fitness programs. Audio fitness programs that tell you what to do but have no visuals on proper form seem both useless and dangerous especially for inexperienced individuals. So called “Beginner Fitness Routines” seemed only for beginners who are already in great shape.I also wish the app would allow you to zoom in on the graphs that they displayed as the Fitbit app does. My eye sight isn’t horrible but not the best and I found myself having to squint to read much of the app text or see the graphs accurately.The sleep tracking seems mostly accurate but as mentioned above I don’t like the way the app presents the information.The Tone  feature is interesting but I just don’t see much use for it and it just burns through the battery life. Seems more gimmicky than anything else..I could overlook all this since it’s personal preference and opinion but now after about 6 months I am noticing the Heart Rate readings have suddenly become completely inaccurate. One afternoon the app said I had completed over 2 weeks of the recommend activity (150 per week) in about 3 hours as my activity level suddenly read over 300. All I did during that time was prepare my dinner for the evening. Nothing strenuous at all. The band was reading my heart rate around 175 bpm for much of the time. Something tells me if that was accurate I would have felt or noticed something while just moving calmly around in my kitchen. Earlier that same day I spent time on my rower which the band didn’t register anything above 78 bpm and I ended up having to enter that activity manually.I erased all my health data and starting over and also started wearing my Fitbit when I could just to compare and make sure there wasn’t something really going on. A few times now the Halo band is reading sudden extremely high heart rate levels while my Fitbit is reading everything as being normal and regular.This Halo doesn’t seem ready as readings are not accurate and the app needs a lot of improvement as it seems clunky and not very intuitive, at least IMO.I’d return it but after 6 months I doubt I’d have much luck.",1
112,"Context: Why did I buy this? I wanted to track steps, heart rate, and sleep, and I did not want a screen on my wrist. I have a mechanical watch that I like to wear, so I did not want a second watch, which is what most highly rated fitness trackers are: a watch with a tracker. I previously spent a decent amount of $ on Fitbits that fell apart, so they were out. I have not used it much for higher intensity athletic activity. Mostly I'm walking, hiking, doing yoga, maybe light lifting. Also, I've never used the voice tone feature, just seems like a frill that I don't need.Update: I've now used this device for a while. It is durable, I even wear it playing basketball. It doesn't give me too much in the points department during weight lifting, but it almost overly rewards cardio. Other reviewers have written that they have trouble getting to 150 points even if running 3mi each day. I exercise maybe 3 or 4 times a week and I clear 300 points every week. I do wish there was more transparency here on the points algorithm. Just started using the body fat % feature. Pretty slick. Will update if it does anything for me.Why I like this tracker:Appearance: No screen, small and discrete, can wear alongside my wrist watch. It's simple and compact which suggests its not easily to break.Performance: Accuracy seems fine. Step counts are a little higher than what I get on my iPhone, which doesn't bother me, because I'm looking at relative steps (did I move a lot today or just a little?), the count itself is meaningless. Heart rate monitor definitely knows when my heart rate goes up. Again, don't care that much about whether readings are +/- 10 or 15 on my actual BPM. Am I exercising? Am I sleeping? If it can distinguish between activities, that's good enough for me. Battery life is fine. It can go several days without a charge. I usually charge it while in in the shower. Not saying it couldn't handle the shower, but why risk it? Most importantly, it works, and it keeps working, and it shows no signs of wear after a few months. Whereas two $150 Fitbits disintegrated on me in 6 months.Room for improvement:The app is a bit funny. It sets an activity goal for me, which is met just by walking for an hour two days in a row, and I cannot adjust the goal, so for me, a not very active person, it's a useless point/goal system. Otherwise, its fine, just lots of crap I don't need. Give me the heart rate, step activity, and sleep tracker and I'm good.The wrist strap is not great. It comes undone often while I'm asleep (I move around a lot in my sleep). The tracker doesn't come off my wrist but it certainly isn't getting an accurate read. If this product survives, I imagine there will be either (1) some wrist-strap redesigns or (2) some aftermarket straps. Also the color... not my favorite. I got black, and then used a sharpie to color the white sprinkles.",5
113,"I would love to review this, but after 3… yes 3 attempts at receiving one that I can actually try,  I have come up empty handed.The first order was running late and instead of receiving it two Friday’s ago, delivery was rescheduled for last Monday. The tracking on my first order showed that it would be delivered simultaneous with two other packages. I opened my delivery with great excitement only to find that the Halo was not among the delivered packages.I contacted customer care, who could not locate my first Halo and proceeded to advise me that my first Halo would be redelivered that coming Friday, 24 September- a whole week after I was first supposed to have received it.As I was expressing my dismay, as ordering a new one would (or shall I say should) result in me receiving it before the one I originally ordered (on 22 September), the tracking on my first Halo order changed to indicate that it would be delivered in 15 minutes! Yay!!My celebration was very short lived, as the response to my good news that I would be receiving the package in 15 minutes, was an unsolicited “I have good news, I have successfully cancelled your order” 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️. No amount of begging, pleading or crying whilst watching the Amazon delivery vehicle drive by down the road, could get them to un- cancel it.So begrudgingly, Halo no 2 was ordered. It was delivered (a day late) on 23 September, but hey, I finally had my hands on Halo no 2. Inside the brown delivery box, I found the Halo box in its green sleeve. Upon removing the sleeve, I noticed that the seal on the box had nearly been broken…. maybe they checked it before shipping ??? I opened the box …- I ordered the Blush and noticed a slightly darker spot on the fabric bracelet… odd… but excitement and curiosity got the better of me.I charged it up and researched my next steps. I installed the app and paired Halo no 2 with my phone. This wasn’t an easy process and after troubleshooting and factory resetting Halo no 2, I got it paired and my basic info loaded. Phew…. Finally it was ready to use, but now it was time for bed.I wore it the next day, but when I wanted to check my info and start on some of those wonderful fitness apps promised with the 6 month membership that was included, the Halo app told me I don’t have a membership.Upon contacting customer service, I was told that the membership was paused. Well, I didn’t pause it! So who did? Was Casper the friendly ghost messing with Halo no 2!?The dots started connecting in my mind, so I asked about the seal. I was advised that the box should have been sealed and the only reasons it would not have been sealed were (1) the seal tore accidentally. Well this wasn’t the case, as it was cleanly and nearly opened with the middle piece of plastic of the seal not even in the the outer brown box, not to mention that the sleeve cover was over box and was in pristine condition. So enter option (2) …. Halo no 2 was previously returned by someone…. Now that darker spot on the strap is starting to take on a whole new meaning (gross) and it seems Casper wasn’t a ghost at all, but the former (unhappy) owner of Halo no 2.If I wanted a pre-owned Halo, I would have bought one. Besides, logic dictates that the Halo would have been worn by not-Casper whilst performing some physical activity likely leading to perspiration.The very understanding customer service assistant called in 2 different people to help, resulting in Halo no 2 returning (hopefully not to be passed on to the next unsuspecting customer) and Halo no 3 being dispatched to me, due to be delivered today, 28 September, a whole two weeks after my Halo journey started….Will anyone be surprised to hear that I am not a happy camper with Halo no 3 in hand? It wasn’t delivered and is reflected as “running late”.And so the saga continues… At this stage it better be pretty awesome to make me happy after all this.This has been an extremely unpleasant and highly disappointing experience! And with one of their own products no less!",1
114,"Putting this thing on the charger is a nightmare; and you have to do it every other day. I’ve had it for two months & it still takes me at least 20 tries to get it on the charger correctly. It’s super annoying to take off. The Velcro on the band does not fit easily thru the loop & you need to press your arm into your body to hold it & use your hand to pull it. Annoying. It’s also super uncomfortable. Like, it hurts to wear. I’ve worn a smart watch every day for the last 6+ years so it’s not that I’m not used to wearing a device. I find it’s much better to wear it on the inside of my wrist rather than the outside. I wear it on the inside of my right wrist since I still wear my Apple Watch on my left. The sleep tracking is wildly inaccurate. It won’t know if you get up to go to the bathroom & get back into bed & lay awake for 2 hours because it doesn’t track disturbances less than 5 minutes long. So you can get up, grab a cup of coffee, sit down & be answering emails & it still thinks you’re sleeping. I wanted to love the Halo. I had to have it for two reasons, the first being it tracks how you sound to others, the second is it interacts/is endorsed by the WW app. So, it does keep track of how you sound to others. I don’t find it practical tho because it doesn’t tell you what you said. So if you check it at the end of the day it will say “At 3:15:21 today you sounded ecstatic. At 3:15:54 today you sounded scared”  How in the heck am I supposed to know what I said at 3:15:21? I know we don’t want it recording what we’re saying, 24/7 but it only captures random things you say so it could at least capture that sentence so you know what you said. It also doesn’t kick all the info over to the WW app; sleep tracking the main one. You get daily points for tracking everything in the WW app but for some reason the sleep info doesn’t sync. And it won’t let me have my Apple watch AND the Halo connected so I miss those points. I am wearing it all the time (except in the shower) but only because I already paid for it & have the six months use of the app. I don’t recommend the Halo. Especially after having a Samsung Gear & then Apple watches for the last 6 years. I will say, the body scan thing is pretty cool. Just to look at, I mean. It doesn’t seem to serve a purpose other than to see progress. It doesn’t personalize workouts or meal plans or anything & it doesn’t integrate that info into WW app at all. It keeps track of your steps & heart rate, but so does my Apple Watch. I took a 75 minute speed walk & I had to manually enter in the walk in the Halo app. It tracked my steps (over 9000) but it didn’t know I did anything out of the ordinary. Overall I don’t recommend the Halo. If you have any questions I’ll try to answer them.",1
115,"I was a big fitbit guy back in 2015/2016, but after replacing it three to four times in a single year I needed something better. I've been using an Apple Watch for some time now and it is very ""meh"" in the fitness department and I won't wear something that bulky to track sleep. Wife got me the halo thinking it would be a nice surprise X-mas gift (she's great!). Wore it for about four months and unfortunately had to give it up.First, it's just flat out uncomfortable. There was some skin irritation but it did not last long. During the day, I was constantly adjusting it; I could feel every bit of the hard plastic through the band. At night it would drive me crazy and sometimes keep me up, so there were nights where I would not wear it at all.For the activity measurement part, it seemed ""ok"". Point tracking system is easy, and the sedentary hours did motivate me to get off my butt sometimes.Sleep measurement was mind boggling. I am a chronic insomniac; I have a hard time falling asleep, and I typically wake up almost every night around the same time but do eventually go back to sleep. This device would say, every night, I fell asleep in less than 10 minutes....even though I was still awake. Apparently if I am just stationary for a while, say, reading a book, my heart rate drops (I have a low resting heart rate) and I'm apparently asleep, at least according to the device. To make matters worse, when I would wake up at 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning, get out of bed, and sit on the couch and read for a bit, the device would not even register it. I usually am back in bed within an hour or so, then get up at 5:30 to start my day. The device, though, would tell me I had no interruptions. Really? You can't detect when someone is literally getting out of bed? Or in bed, awake, reading a book?Voice recognition...this is not something that I knew anyone needed. This did seem pretty accurate. People often tell me I sound a certain way, and this device confirmed it. That being said, it absolutely devours battery life; better left off, I say.I'm sure the device is great for some folks, but not for me. The body mass aspect seems great, and people  could probably relax a bit; nobody is sending naked ""pictures"" of you anywhere. I did not pay any attention to any of the multitude of fitness programs the app kept tossing at me (almost like advertisements.....hmmm) so I can't comment on that.If you want a device that tracks your steps (and does so generously, as it seems to always 10-15% more than I actually did), I say go for it. For the sleep aspect, look at another device.Also would not pay $100 for this, not in its current state. Needs an update/new version.",3
116,So for the last month I have had 2 trackers on my right arm The Amazon Halo and the Whoop Strap 3.0When it comes to charging the Halo needs to be charged every other day and you need to take the Halo band off your arm to do so and I have been putting it to charge while I take a shower so that work out but I would have liked the charge to last longer.  The Whoop strap can be charged while you are wearing the strap and each charge lasts 4-5 days do when it comes to charging the whoop is a clear winner.Both the Halo and Whoop does a good job tracking your sleep and they are pretty close most days. Some days they differ 30 minutes and I do not know who is more accurate.The Halo has a body scan feature that I like it is kind of cool to play around with. The Halo also keeps track of your steps and that is something that the Whoop does not do.  The Whoop tracks your recovery and that is something the Halo does not do.  I have found that whoop feature to be accurate on days when I feel tired the recovery score has usually been low.The Halo and Whoop are showing a difference in your measured heart rate highs and I do not know if the Halo or the whoop is showing the accurate reading but they are worn on the same arm and the readings should be more accurate.  Today for example the The Halo showed my Max heart rate to be 151 while the whoop shows max heart rate as 171. I guess as long as you just keep comparing your results from the same device it does not matter what device you are using they seem to be consistent with the whoop showing a higher heart rate than the Halo does.The monthly membership fee for Halo is significant lower for the Halo vs. the Whoopwhen it shows to calories used the halo usually show that I have used more calories during the day compared to what the Whoop shows once again I do not know what is the accurate count.Bottom line there are features I like about the Halo that the whoop does not offer such as the body scan  and the low monthly membership cost and that it shows a step count.  I love the way you charge the Whoop strap and I like looking at the strain while I workout and looking at my overall recovery for the day and that is something the Halo is not offering.,4
117,"The body fat feature is wildly inaccurate. I’m someone who has been making their way to a goal of 10% body fat. To track that I take an average of a caliper reading and 2 separate body fat scales. Amazon’s halo seems inclined to keep you attached to the device by giving you a higher body fat score. My tracking has me at 12.5%, amazon halo gave me 19.8%But this is also a dangerous feature for some people with food issues, so I tell you here and now the body comp feature does not work.The most obvious caveat to it is that amazon uses the low definition front facing camera. IF you believe an algorithm can determine body fat from visual inspection, certainly that visual would need to be high def.To put a fine point on it; I have a 6 pack. The halo photos that were taken made my abs look like it was a little round pudge pocket. On top of that, it’s inconceivable that you could see your abs as I do with a 19.8% body fat score.Point blank: the feature doesn’t work. So don’t put any merit. Body fat scales aren’t super accurate either BUT if you are trying to get in shape, then your first BF reading is your baseline. The number may not be technically accurate but if it goes down, you know you are on track for your goal of healthy body fat.PS- the halo sleep tracker is awesome. So I’m not meaning to shat on the product as a whole",4
118,"I wanted to love this band SOOOO BAD, but I was underwhelmed.I wore the band for almost a week along with my Galaxy watch to see how the stats compared. I mainly wanted it for the Body Scan feature.I do agree with other users that it is not fair to compare the halo against a smart watch feature wise. But, for the main purpose of activity, steps, and sleep tracking...it's fair game.I love how minimal the watch is. No distracting screen with notifications popping up every 10 seconds.The points system vs relying on steps feature is pretty cool. It became a game for me and made me want to move around more to see how many points I could get.The Body scan was cool, but not overly exciting. I could be baised because I have a smart scale and the info was pretty close. I thought I'd be more thrilled with the scans to track my progress, but realllly I could take my own pictures and track it that way. So, between my scale and hand dandy phone camera, I'd be just as content than with using the body scan feature.I've seen some people say this feature is counter productive and can cause further self esteem/Body issues. I'm on the fluffier side and don't feel 100% in my body, but I like it because it doesn't allow you to lie to yourself about where you really are. But it will increase self esteem as you see the changes over time with the scans.Cons: I did notice about a 80-100 step count different between my watch and the band. The band counted less steps than my watch. Not too big of a deal since it wasn't THAT far off.The sleep tracker could be better. The only thing I didn't like is it can't differentiate between a nap and going to bed. It counts it as one thing and shows your awake time as a sleep disturbance. Even though there is a 6 hour time gap between them. My watch does a much better job than that.I cant speak on the tone feature since I didn't use it.Others have mentioned lining the band on the charging clip can be a hit or miss...I agree.Overall, if I didn't have my watch I'd probably be happy with the band. Honestly, I didn't really get anything out of the band that my watch didn't provide or that I could track myself with a scale and camera.",4
119,"Worked well until it didn't. I had a little trouble with the link for the replacement. When I did complete the replacement request, I received my new device in just a couple days. I am satisfied",4
120,"Strap: The hook and loop strap is more breathable than the sports silicone type, but the hooks tens to catch and pull on my delicate sweaters and clothing. It is also not that easy to get on and off if you have mobility issues due to the fact it doesn’t open all the way (it just widens in diameter.Sensor: seems to be more accurate than my other trackers and automatically categorizes what it thinks was a workout if I forget to start and stop in a fitness app (very handy). The shape and size of the sensor needs work. I am a petite woman and it is too long. It also domes outward (convex) more than my Apple Watch so I definitely notice I’m wearing it. My wrists are very lean and so it is just unbearable to wear facing outward (hurts and bruises my skin). I can wear it in the inner wrist better, but then I have a bit of an issue typing unless I push the sensor up higher on my arm. I have purchased a larger fitness arm band so I can wear it on the forearm when I Row and that works out great!Battery: waaaay more efficient than Apple Watch since it has no screen or extras…exactly what I was looking for though. No distractions. I think I get more than 3 days on a full charge.Voice tone feature: just meh. I don’t really need it and the time schedule for sampling is weird. Also, by the time I check it I have no idea what I was doing or who I was talking to to draw meaningful conclusions. Turned that off.Body composition feature: really impressed with the accuracy. I’ve had this done professionally and it was pretty close. Did it feel a bit intimidating taking pics of myself  in my fitted workout clothing to get analyzed…yep, but you can wear the same fitted clothing you would to the gym and the analysis will work fine. Amazon says the photos aren’t stored and it converts the photo into this kinda line drawing rendering thing. Use at your discretion.Bottom line: great to use for lightweight non-distracted fitness and activity tracking for the price but be careful with your clothing and if you are in the petite/lean side, maybe wear it on a more padded area of your arm.",3
121,"I was looking for some kind of activity/sleep tracking wrist band and when I recieved the link to purchase I was excited to get something that looked like a ""fit bit"" type tracker. Overall I am pretty happy with the accuracy of the bracelet. I work in an office and I do have to do some walking around the building, it has been pretty exciting to be able to literally count my steps to see where they match up and to see it match up almost exactly.The wristband itself is super comfortable. I often forget im wearing it which wasnt the case with other fitness trackers ive owned.Like others may have already noted, it tracks your sleep pretty accurately unless you are wanting to take a nap later in the day, or get up for great than 15 minutes and then go back to bed. However, I can't speak for those who don't sleep during ""conventional times"".The app itself is pretty cool. I personally love the labs and the automatically tracking of exercise when your heart rate starts to elevate. I used to have workout apps, meditation apps, sleep tracking apps, and now I have them all in one. I really like the 150 points/week goal. Sometimes I go over and when I am short I try to make up for it because I dont want to be under my goal. Also, I appreciate the alerts that tell me when my phone is low battery and when it is all charged up.I don't use the Tone feature since it drains my battery and I don't really care for advice on my tone lmao.The body scan portion is also one of my favorites. I understand the reservation of uploading pictures in minimal clothing to their cloud (Although they claim to delete them and that they are super private, I don't believe a word tech companies say about their use of information, so I understand if its not for everyone. However, I take progress pics in minimal clothing anyway and I'm sure Google ALREADY has these pictures through my google photos, so I personally feel if they wanted these types of pictures of me, they could already get them lol. Just my personal opinion on why this doesnt bother me.Overall, I wish I could track my food intake since food has always been a bit tougher with me than exercise, but that's just a personal preference since I don't know of any fitness trackers that also take it food information.Overall I will probably recommend the halo band and will most likely remain subscribed to their membership.UPDATE Feb 8, 2021 after a little over than 3 months of use, my charger just stopped working. I haven't moved my charger since I first plugged it in so I know it just gave out. Cheap quality. Have to spend $20 on a new one. For the price of the band I would have expected more. Dropped rating to 3 stars.",3
122,"It was worth it when it had the free subscription, but then that ran out and the only useful feature is step tracking. But multiple times this week, I had a lot of steps but when I tried to sync them, the app made me reset my device and lose the unsynced dataEdit Oct 16, 2022:They called me right after I posted this review/issue to get details of the issue I was having.  I still lost my data a few times but it seems like they want to keep improving their product so I bumped the review up to 3 stars. Sync issues only happened a few times after getting a new device but it should be able to restore your profile on a new phone without a band reset, so I hope they fix that. I will continue using this as a pedometer and sleep tracker.",3
123,"The historical charts on ALL functions need the ability to drill down for useable info, not just a summary.For example, under activity you can see your resting and maximum heart rates on a daily basis and can't drill down to a specific time. It could be useful to know when you had an accelerated heart rate.It would be nice to add NOTES to all sections to remind yourself about things that may affect Halo's analysis.I will discuss each of the 4 things Halo monitors:ACTIVITYThis section has some flexibility and seems to have a lot of useful information.For example, you CAN manually tell Halo about activities that you do, so it can properly analyze them.SLEEPThe sleep tracking was my main interest. It currently lacks flexibility and details to be really useful.It makes assumptions on when you are going to bed to sleep. If you like to lay on the couch or in bed to read, review emails, or watch TV, it apparently doesn't know the difference and causes it's calculations to be wrong.It would be nice if there was a way to see when it thinks that you are laying down to sleep and an OPTIONAL override. Maybe change the LED color when it is in the sleep analysis mode? Modifying the app to allow input and personalization would be great!Also, there isn't a nap/power nap detection and those definitely add to your rest.Being able to manually enter notes and/or other events such as meal and exercise times would be invaluable as these can affect your sleep quality. This would be useful when analyzing best practices or discussing with your doctor.TONEThe tone of voice analysis is interesting, but again doesn't seem to be flexible at all. Maybe I am missing something?I did some tests by manually invoking the analysis during several conversations (without disclosing what I was doing to others) and then asking them to rank my tone using Halo's parameters. Halo was consistently wrong.I tried relearning my voice. No help. I don't see another way for Halo to learn from this and make corrections for my voiceSo, since it eats the battery, I turned that feature off.BODYI haven't enabled the Body analysis features yet, so I can't comment on it. Maybe next month.With all that said, I sincerely hope that the Halo team reads the reviews and can act accordingly if they haven't already thought of them.I got mine on early release and am not aware of any updates so far. However,I am sure that they are working hard on improvements and look forward to them.If the state that the Halo is currently in is it, I will return it. IMHO, right now it is more of a novelty and not a serious health monitoring device.",3
124,"Halo is what I expected it to be:  simple and basic.My favorite feature of this fitness tracker is that it doesn't have a distracting screen.  I already wear a traditional watch that I love and wear everyday so I definitely did not want a smart watch.  The Halo is very comfortable to wear, I have sensitive skin and haven't had any issues as some people have mentioned.  I wear it during 100 degree yoga sessions and even in this environment, the band is very comfortable.The reason for 3 starts is....?  It could be a lot better.  I would be willing to pay more if it offered more stats, like distance traveled while hiking, running or walking.  Pace would be great too, GPS.. etc.  The app has also been recently very slow to load so this gets pretty annoying.  Hopefully, this is fixed.The app consists of 4 categories:  Activity, Sleep, Tone & Body.Activity:  Measures activity with a point system and is based on movement and intensity.  Unfortunately, it rarely measures my yoga activity perhaps because my heart rate is not that high...?  you may also view your live heart rate.Sleep:  This by far has been the most accurate and I find very interesting to see my nightly sleep pattern.Tone:  I wanted to really like this, but unfortunately it is not accurate.  My daughter also has a Halo and we have done real-time Tone results and saw that while I spoke, HER Halo was picking up my voice and logging it on her band and vice-versa, when she spoke, my Halo was picking up my tone instead of hers.  Also, during my commute to work, while I have not said a word, I have later noticed that it picked up Tone from the podcast I was listening to in my car.  So due to all of this inaccuracy, I have muted my band.  Also, Tone does drain the battery faster than when it's muted.  Yes, it can easily be muted.Body:  This is a cool feature that as far as I know, no other fitness band offers.  You take clothed pictures, you can wear a sports bra for women and fitted shorts you may or may not save the photos.  Then it creates a black and white image of your photos, interesting if you want to see how your body had progressed.  Also, very interesting to see body fat percentage totaled after images are taken.Overall, I would recommend if you want a simple fitness tracker that does not have a distracting screen.  This is want attracted me initially.  There is a monthly Halo membership that I currently have for free (6 months free) as an offer when it was first released.  I believe it's regularly a $4 monthly fee.",3
125,"I purchased two of these bands for my husband and I for Xmas. We both own apple watches but have been wanted to track our sleep. My husbands never worked properly and despite our attempts to fix it we decided to send his back. Mine worked just fine but was very painful on my wrist. After a day of wearing it my wrist felt bruised and only got worse the longer I wore it so I sent mine back. Aside from that there was a few interesting features that make it a bare bones health band and if you have nothing else then this would be a good start. If you have the extra money to buy a Fitbit or Apple Watch (even an older model) then you would get much more value out of those (without a membership).  Here’s a few thoughts about the features:Comfort- as I said, if you have a slender wrist then this band is pretty uncomfortable (I wore a size medium). My husband on the other hand felt fine wearing his (he wore a large).Sleep feature- this is why I bought this band and I’m torn on how I feel about the accuracy. The biggest inaccuracies are in the fall asleep part, it always said I fell asleep within 10-15 minutes even though I know it took over an hour each night. It did see that I had a few sleep disturbances and even knew I woke up and stayed awake for hours one night. It gives you a sleep score and a few nights I had terrible sleep but yet my scores were in the 90’s which seemed wrong. So I would say it’s half accurate but to be fair there isn’t any sleep bands on the market (even whoop and oura) that are really accurate so it’s hard to be too mad at this one.Tone- this was an interesting feature and fun to look at but definitely not very accurate. I would have a perfectly good day, in a good mood and everything but every tone it captures would be “angry,” or “disgusted.” Apparently I have resting b**ch tone?Activity- this is another grey area for me. It gives you “points” throughout the day based on your activities and the goal is to have 150 “points” by the end of the week. Great idea with one flaw, it deducts points if it thinks your being sedentary. So if you started you morning with a good workout, spent the rest of the day of your feet being active and built up a good amount of points then great right? No, because as soon as you sit down and rest for the evening your points will start to go down. It won’t be a bunch of points of course but mentally it’s a big disappointment to see your hard work start to decrease just because you decided to put your feet up after dinner. If feels like a punishment which is unfair because you can’t be active all the time.Body- I never used the feature so I have no opinion on this one.There is also some workout videos and sleep noises that is nice but nothing you can’t get for free through a sleep app or YouTube. All in all it was interesting to look at but definitely not worth paying for. If the membership was free then maybe I would have worn it longer but probably not. It was more of a novelty then anything helpful and the feature I bought it for (sleep) was too flawed. Like I said before though, if you own nothing else and can’t afford a more expensive health tracker then this is an ok basic band but the info it gives off isn’t worth paying for.",2
126,"The band and app are pretty decent (now) I had some issues when it was still early in the trial phase but after lots of feedback to and from Amazon I think those kinks are worked out for now. My main reasons for gettting it were the tone feature the sleep  and the activity tracking features. I have had no issues with the sleep tracking. It records when I fall asleep and wake up as well as disturbances no matter how minor if I actually get out of bed. It does, however, sometimes tell me I slept good eventhough I feel awful upon waking. The tone feature has been buggy from start to finish but I've actually been able to use it finally and it seems somewhat accurate? I'm not sure as it doesn't let you see or hear what was said but if you view it live it's pretty nifty. I have a very monotone voice (like a less cool Alan Rickman but a slightly cooler Ben Stein) so the fact it can detect any change at all is remarkable. The body scans are very hard to do and such an aggrevation I typically give up. I have successfully done 1 but it's been weeks. It seems to track way more steps than my other bands but it is accurate according to my Google fit (and by that I mean Pokemon Go). It does measure activities that are more strenuous differently and that's one of the things I really like about it. The points system is very psychologically rewarding as I feel better when I go over my points and it motivates me to take those extra steps or run instead of walk. I like the minimalist band but still try to check the time on it occasionally. The band (I switched to one of the sport bands due to frequent handwashing) is as comfortable as any other and is pretty lightweight. I like that the bands are so easy to change and that the actual device can be removed and both can be sanitized safely. I do not wear it in the shower ( that's when I charge it since the battery life is very short lived) bit I'm confident it would hold up. All in all it's a good product with a shaky start but the changes that Amazon has made so far and their fast response to all of my feedback gives me confidence it will only get better.",4
127,"I have nothing to compare it to, this was my first fitness tracker band but it's large and I keep looking to it as if it should have the time and it does not, I now realize that I'd prefer a smart watch that's a fitness tracker as well. As for the app, I rated it a littler low because it's not that intuitive to use but it functions pretty good except for the sleep tracker which is a bummer, if I take a nap or wake up for a bit and then go back to sleep for a bit the tracker doesn't recognize it. As for the fitness tracking piece, I actually like it, I like the little point system it has and I love the calorie tracker and it's the most accurate step tracker I've ever had so I'm loving that too. If you're into watching videos of people working out the app cycles through things and offers suggestions every time you pull it up which I think is nice. And no you do not have to be naked on camera or even take a picture at all if you don't want to, I actually like this feature but I hate that my picture is in there but I set it to never see it and frankly forget it's there.. still want it to not be a thing.. perhaps Amazon could look at just doing a scan without taking and saving a picture... I don't know, I don't even know how any of this works! One last thing, this band does no nudges of any kind, it does not alert you of anything from the actual band.Anyway, for $99 (plus a subscription fee) when there are smart watch fitness trackers out there in the same price range, I'd ultimately say pass on this and get one of those but I don't know if the Halo is a better tracker than others, if you just want a band I think fitbit offers a much lighter and smaller band for less money, this band is fairly annoying and I've tried both types of bands at this point. Oh and you must have the special charger, the whole thing clips in and Amazon doesn't even provide a wall charger.. this isn't ideal because if it breaks or you lose it you can't charge the band until you get a replacement. Not sure why this couldn't be QI compatible at least. Maybe the next version will be more worth the money, at this point I feel like it should've been free to test out not marketed for purchase.",3
128,"I really like this gadget.  I’m really happy with the data it provides regarding sleep, and tone of voice.  The voice thing is some kind of magic - I can’t understand how it works, but it’s got really good real-time feedback, and I just think it is amazing.Sleep is broken down into a number of categories, including REM Sleep and light/deep sleep.  It has given me really good insights into how to improve my sleep - this has probably provided me with the most useful and actionable feedback.  I’ve altered a number of patterns, and that has improved my overall well-being.The big “but” here, and why I had a hard time deciding whether I should give this 2 or 3 stars is the battery.  When using voice tone, it runs down very quickly.Which leads me to the biggest problem - the charging setup for this thing is really unacceptably bad.  The charger is fashioned into a kind of a clamp.  The top of the clamp makes it difficult to see whether or not the charging pins are aligned with the device’s charging apparatus.  I’ve seen some people say that it isn't a big deal, and you can just wiggle the thing around to get it to start taking the charge.  That’s not my experience.  In the first few days, I managed to bend one of the pins on the charger, trying to get the alignment correct.  I managed to fix it, so it does charge, but sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes of fiddling with the thing to get it to start charging.  So, It is a big deal.  It takes an inordinate amount of time to get the thing set in the charger.I see this as a major design flaw.  I have a GPS watch that also has pins, but ut gas a magnet that fits into a groove next to the pins, my apple watch has a magnetic charger.  So, the Halo band should not be so difficult and frustrating to charge.  And I’m guessing that this is something that a lot if people are struggling with because I received an email from Amazon saying that I might like a Halo charger - for $19.  The Halo is pretty close to brand new - I guess it might be a helpful hint that I can get a second charger to use in a different location... or they could be marketing it to people who simply can’t make theirs work.  A Suunto replacement charger is $6.00.  But it doesn't break. Because magnet.So, I really like what the Halo does. But I might stop using it altogether because the  charging is so awful.",3
129,"First impressions are:1st of all I love it! I love the pink band. Its light weight, but it feels well made. I do wonder how long the velcro is going to hold up. I know that we can buy new bands, but I am hoping not to go through bands quicker than underwear.The instructions are sorely lacking. Listen,  I know the app walks you through it step by step, but the paper instructions just aren't there. Perhaps a giant: ""Stop idiot! And just download the app for setup.""Also, this is purely nit-picking at this point, but why was the wall charger not included. I mean, yes most people have them already, yes you can get them cheaply from the store. I just think that at $100 retail price, Amazon could have thrown in the plug in.I find the body scanner fairly accurate. I did do two back to back, and there was just a slight difference of 1%. The slider to see how your body might look while losing fat is interesting, if nothing more than pure entertainment. The body scanner is really a giant part of why I wanted this product. For me, it was easy to take the pictures, and the percentage was right around what I was estimating my body fat percentage to be.I have set up the tone feature - I am not sure how much I will really use it, but its there so I may as well try it out. I have already noticed that I am trying not to get after my kids as the Halo will hear and track it. 🤣I have just worked out with it, and it did pick up my workout. I did of course have to change what KIND of activity it was, but I believe my heart rate to be accurate as well.I will see in the morning how it tracks my sleep tonight, I am hoping that is accurate as well.I haven't gotten to any of the labs yet, but I did glance through them, and am excited to try a couple. I am really excited to get feed back on my health habits after wearing this thing for awhile.Welp, here's to hoping that I continue to like this thing. As far as first impressions go, it seems to be just what I was expecting.",4
130,"I have used my Halo every day for about 4 months now. The activity tracking has helped me increase my physical activity. Though I haven’t used them much, there are TONS of videos to help with increasing physical health: movement, strength, yoga…all kinds of different. There are some delicious recipes in the nutrition section. I do wish there was a nutrition tracker - to help see what I’m eating that isn’t the recipes in the nutrition section. The sleep tracking is also why we got this band and it’s been very good. The band stays charged forever, which is great! I only have to charge it once every 10 days or so. I also like the feature of being able to add activity for those times when you do have to take off the band. Great tracker and the price is great too!",4
131,"The Amazon Halo does have potential, but I would recommend waiting for version 2.0.  It has a lot of potential, but still needs refining.Pros: Accurate step counting Lots of data on sleep quality and duration Great battery life (with exceptions) Excellent chargerCons: Sleep on your arm wrong = deep painful bruises Skin irritation under the Halo No smart device functions Bad design on body shape Cost per monthBefore I elaborate further on the pros and cons, if you need or want a watch, remember you will have to wear the watch on one arm, the Halo on the other – two devices rather than one.My comparison device is the Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro, which I have used for several years.  Comparing price, the Halo is about half the money - $100 vs $180.Steps – The Halo counts the steps a little more accurately than the Gear Fit, however, the Gear Fit counts stairs as well.Sleep – Both devices monitor your sleep, however the Halo also monitors how long it takes you to get to sleep.  Both devices have failed to read data on occasion, but it is rare.Battery – The Halo has great battery life with one exception, tone monitoring will suck the battery down FAST! The Gear Fit will need charging before the Halo, but it also provides all the smart watch functions as well as health monitoring.Charger – I really like the design of the Halo charger.  It clamps the body in tightly and charges quickly.  The Gear Fit charger works, but it is not as reliable in comparison.Shape – Here the Halo gets a total FAIL. The body of the device arches into your arm rather than contouring with your arm like the Gear Fit.  If you sleep on your arm wrong during the night, you can wake up with a deep bruise that will prevent you from wearing it for several days.  The body design needs to be revamped in a major way.Skin Irritation – I also notice irritation beneath the body of the device. It is almost like a rash or burn at times. I will not say this is a game changer, but I do believe it has to do with the shape of the device – minimal air exchange between the body and your arm.Smart Functions – As I said before, if you need or want a watch, this will become an additional device you wear.  No display at all.Cost per month – If memory serves, the Halo carries a $4/month charge for the service.  Samsung Health is free.  With the limited amount of data the Halo provides at this time, it is way too much money.Halo has potential, but it needs more work.  The functions provided are minimal compared to the Gear Fit.  I have not played with the BMI functions – so basically, it is only providing me with step count and sleep.  Tone monitoring kills the battery to fast to be useful.  To check heart rate, you need to go to the app.  The labs I have tried requiring me to click in the app that I did complete the requirements. By comparison, the Gear Fit will tell me heart rate, steps, calories burned, floors climbed, and even start a workout - all from the watch itself (ignoring all the other smart features).If you need a health monitoring device, it is not bad and is competitively prices – ignoring the monthly charge. But if you want a full featured device, wait for version 2.0.",2
132,"I really wanted to love this device, but am ready to sell it now.  Like every wrist worn activity tracker, it doesn’t count steps. This is common for all of them and I should have anticipated this. I have been wearing it on my ankle for the most part which is annoying. Interestingly, it could not track anything when I wore it on my right ankle that has a tatoo. My treadmill counts steps and the device did not count anything. When I reached out to tech help, they told me to delete the app and start over to re-register the device!  Uhg!  Thankfully, I switched ankles and it was able to track.The sleep tracker seems accurate - it knows when your are in REM vs. deep sleep vs. light sleep and awake. Very interesting to review it - at least for a few weeks. Then it all just looks the same.I was expecting much more from the voice tone analysis. Very disappointing. It is very basic.  Useless really. It told me I sounded shy and reserved and I thought - who was I even talking to as at that time I was alone. Turns out I was asking my Alexa Device a question.  Don’t know about anyone else, but I have to speak slowly and calmly a d enunciate clearly with my Alexa devices or they just don’t understand me. When I used it during a meeting, again very basic info - you sounded happy at this tim and sad at this time (happy greeting a colleague and sad when I heard someone was let go). Super basic!!  Nothing insightful. And when the microphone is in it really drains the battery.It does come with workout videos (labs) also, diet and sleep labs too. The workout videos are designed for home use. I hate getting on the floor so have only tried a couple. Tried a sleep lab - which was a reminder to go to bed. A diet one to eat an apple a day. The labs all seem to last a week.  I am not taking advantage of them. I should!!  But like I said, I really hate getting on the floor. I’m a treadmill girl.I hate the charging clip. You have to align it so little prongs enter the device. This sometimes requires realigning it a couple three times to get it right. Also, not in love with the shape of the device; it is concave (rounded outward). I find it a bit uncomfortable on my wrist. You have to wear it snuggly too.If you like videos and doing different workouts week to week you may appreciate the app. I’m really over the whole thing.",3
133,"The Halo keeps track of when you were in deep sleep, light sleep, and REM sleep, and gives you a score out of 100 on how good a night of sleep you had last night. I found this mildly interesting. I didn't get any use out of the other features of this product, so couldn't justify the initial price plus the ongoing monthly cost to keep the thing working. I also find it really obnoxious that this product requires a monthly payment to keep it working (after the first 6 months). This could end up costing you hundreds of dollars if you kept your Halo for years.There's also a tone-of-voice analysis app that gives you kind of useless stats at the end of the day: for example, it shows 10% (of... I don't know what...) next to a really happy and excited smiley face, 16% next to a regular happy face, 4% next to a neutral face, and 5% next to a frowny face. Even more useless is the stats under this that tell you your tone of voice was ""dismissive"" for 1.5 seconds at 11am, and ""excited"" for 1.4 seconds at 3pm, etc. What are you supposed to do with this information? I have no intention of trying to modify my behavior to sound more positive all the time; you need to convey a range of emotions in your tone of voice to effectively convey meaning to other humans. If I tried to sound positive all the time I would sound like an eery Stepford Wife or something. I think what Amazon doesn't realize is sometimes when you are using a ""dismissive"" tone of voice, for example, you are not being dismissive *toward another person*, you may be describing some object (say, a wearable...) that you feel dismissive feelings toward. The person you are talking to is not going to interpret you as being dismissive of them; they will understand that your disdain is reserved for the *object* you are talking about.The one somewhat interesting feature related to the tone of voice app is you can see your tone of voice in real time as you talk -- words will flash on your phone screen and move around different quadrants of a graph denoting positive vs. negative tone of voice and high and low energy (if I'm remembering correctly). That was a neat party trick but not something I have any use for in real life on an ongoing basis (and it drains the battery, I'm sure).The other features are an activity tracking app that I didn't find as accurate as my fitbit.The body scanning app is totally creepy -- you load a mostly naked picture of yourself and then you can have a constant reminder of your body fat percentage on your phone. I think it changes the next time you upload a new photo. This doesn't seem like something you need captured in a phone app because it's not something that quickly and easily updates, or that you'd expect to change on a day-to-day basis -- as I understand it, your body fat percentage only updates when you upload a new nearly-naked photo of yourself, and I don't think your body fat percentage would change enough to be noticeable from one day to the next. So it just seems creepy and useless. I didn't even try to use this feature because I had no interest in it.The Halo app includes health tips from apps you can download for free from your phone's app store, like meditation apps. No need to pay for a monthly membership to get access to these things.All in all it just felt like a lot of money for something that did very few things.",2
134,"The Amazon Halo ,, for what you get for the price it is great option for folks who don’t want to spend a lot but want to have good and close to accurate fitness data at their hands. It is also a good option for those that don’t want a smart watch or a distracting screen. Upsides ,, lots of programs to try ,, workouts , sleep programs(I love the Bionural beats )  , and recipes. For 3.99 a month it is the most affordable fitness tracker for what it offers,, most closely compared to the whoop which is IMO very over priced. Battery life is great as long as you don’t use tone function. The step counter and sleep monitor seem to be very accurate and on par with FitBit , whoop, and apple. Downsides —- you have to add in exercises after you do them manually, which doesn’t give you a good accurate monitor on individual exercises and is a pain to log. Compared to FitBit which recognizes your exercises and logs them for you automatically or if you choose ahead of time on FitBit through exercise list , it then tracks a more accurate record of your time and heart rate during it. There is no way to log your food , while it has some great recipes it has no food log which I find invaluable on my Fitbit to count my macros easily. A cloth wristband might have seemed like a good choice compared to maybe sensitive skin users who didn’t want silicone, but even if you don’t work out human skin oil get clothe dirty pretty fast,, and the band stays wet for a while irritating skin if you sweat or just washed your hands. I resent having to make a secondary purchase of a silicone band for it. The charging unit works but is finicky and bulky ,, much like some of the earlier FitBit chargers (blaze, versa 1,2) . Tone is only a gimmick  that eats your battery ,, at the end of the day ,, I enjoy my Halo ,, for its programs and I use it in conjunction to my FitBit sense ,, and it is a good option if you are looking for a lot of bang for your bucks but don’t want a smart watch type option ,, but I hope they make improvements to halo in the future ,, add a food log ,a choice of a silicone wristband from the start ,, a better charging design, and automatically sense workouts , or option to time them at start so you don’t have to add them in after you do them.",3
135,"I have to say, I stopped wearing the device on my arm.  It is really not providing me any benefit beyond that of my apple watch.  The Halo Device is bulky, ugly and I am constantly having to turn it.  Daytime facing up (fat side up - the way it is designed) so I can type and it doesn't bang into things.  Night time facing down (fat side down) so I can bend my wrist and so it is comfortable to wear while sleeping - initially, I wore it the way it is designed, but I would wake up multiple times during the night to take it off.  Since there is zero interaction with the wrist band without my phone,  it is really not useful.  It is too big, uncomfortable, ungainly and ugly to have on my arm.  I am not a fan.I am uncomfortable with the voice recognition feature, because it is constantly listening to me and siphoning potentially privileged and private information for ""analysis"" in Amazon Cloud.  I am not comfortable with the data that is transmitted, stored, analyzed and supposedly deleted by Amazon.  There is no validation or verification on what is happening beyond what is described in the privacy notice.The mobile application is well designed and works pretty well.  The body scan is fast and returns the results quickly.  The data however is not consistent with my scale and the algorithm behind it is easily manipulated via user provided information and via changing the environmental conditions (lighting, clothing, pose, orientation and distance to the camera).  So the body fat estimation is a guess at best.  The body fat estimator graphic is kind of cool.The added value under ""discover"" I really like - programs and workouts are very nice.Sleep tracking (2 stars) - works, gives you pretty good data, but requires the Halo band which is really uncomfortable to wear and wakes me up at night. My Sleep Number bed gives me the same information and more precisely without interfering with my sleep.  So Sleep tracking is useless.Mobile app (4 stars) - Nice UX/UI, well designed and easy to decipher without reading the manual or needing help.  The layout is good, colors are nice, easy to navigate.  I like the body fat estimation interactive graphic.  The algorithm behind the body fat doesn't really provide accurate results so no value there.  The ""discover"" feature is really the only value in the app.Voice Recognition (1 star) - Scary feature.  Invasion of privacy and personally identifiable information.  Wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole wearing a class-5 hazmat suit with positive air pressure.",3
136,"Overall, I think for Amazon's first health band it was not that bad. I would like to clarify a few things from the other reviews on here:1. The charging clip is not that hard to use. Almost impossible to break or mess up.2. You do not need to be naked for the body scans nor do the instructions say to do that.....3. The band will not detect your body fat just by touching your skin.. that logicially makes no sense4. If you're mad it doesn't have a screen or ""face"", that's a you problem... because the pictures show it clearly doesn't have one.5. If you are upset about having to pay for the app.... it literally mentions that when you buy it and is in the description about the product!!Regarding other things... the tone and sleep for sure are not accurate and could be worked on in an update or newer version of the band.Next, I haven't seen many people mention the labs. If you actually explore the labs, you can start and track healthy habits. There are workout, eating healthier, and meditation labs as well. If you don't know how or where to start here you go. It's not bad to at least try.Next, the band sometimes is uncomfortable but I also know you can buy different bands for it. I like that it is not chunky and it's like wearing a bracelet (make sure you pick the right size for you!). I personally like that it has no face cause I don't have to worry about one.Lastly, I like the point system. Some people may find it ""not nice"", but I think it is motivating. Once you hit 150 the point goal goes up which is cool and challenging. You need to workout to actually earn the points and not sit around because it will subtract points. The goal is to get you moving and earn as many points as you can to get you to a healthy point standard.Oh, it does charge fast and hold charge for long periods of time. Other than that I have nothing left to say about it. I would recommend it to friends and family that want something new and different. I am sure after this year, Amazon will be out with a newer version.-Hope this cleared some things up for those interested-",4
137,"Others have written much more in-depth reviews about every aspect of the product, I'll just put some thoughts here comparing it to the only other tracker I've owned (a Fitbit Charge 3 whose display died in about a year and 3 months)For starters, out of the box it does well what it promised: voice tone analyzing, step counts, sleep tracking, heart rate monitor and activity tracking.  Everything seems to track comparable with the Charge 3 except the Halo seems to be reporting me taking more steps overall than the Charge 3. For being automatic the activity tracker does pretty well when detecting activity or workouts i.e. recognizing walking versus running vs cycling. The app and its menus are busy but no worse than Fitbit's.The tone tracker is a unique feature and something they could build on to stand out in the market, although like some other reviewers my tone is usually neutral so I haven't had much to go on from it. I could see it being really useful for someone involved in public speaking or who had a job with one on one interactions with people all day.For subscribers, Halo offers a suite of programs of workouts, nutritional goals, sleep/meditation, etc.  I'm not sure if any of the sleep or activity analysis comes free or if parts of it are also part of the subscription. It's around $48 a year, so for me not worth it but value of subscriptions is a case by case basis for people so I'm not going to judge that aspect of it.Finally, speaking about the price.  Since I signed up for a sneak peak/early access deal, I got the Halo for $69. That's a really good price for everything the Halo does and puts it in range with other lower cost trackers on the market, especially if you're a person that's not a workout enthusiast or amateur athlete and just trying to be more active and looking for a way to track that. However, at the current price of $99, I think you'd be better off spending an extra $20-30 and just getting something like the latest Fitbit with a display, GPS capabilities, cross app integration (with apps like Strava), and a longer battery life (the Halo lasts about two days with the tone feature minimized).",4
138,"So I used to wear a fitbit and my mom wears a Garmin, so I'm comparing to those two for this review. The Halo is just ok.I thought I would like it not having a face but when I go on walks I find myself wanting to know what time it is or how long I've been walking. Also I am jealous that my mom can blue tooth her phone's alerts to her Garmin.My mom's Garmin also let's her know when she hasn't been moving so she will get up and move, and I was the Halo had an option to have something similar.I like to track my sleep, which my Fitbit was really good at. The Halo, not so much. My Fitbit would know when I napped and the Halo doesn't pick up on that. I also feel like I don't get as many steps as I should, but I could be wrong about that.I thought the app for this would be really cool and have interesting data, but it really doesn't. Def something they need to work on. They do have exercise and mindfulness videos tho.So now to what I do like about the Halo... The activity points! I love this feature. It tracks your heart rate to see how active you are and awards points. So even if you don't get your steps in bc youre pushing a stroller or whatever, you'd still get your activity points bc it's tracking your heart. However I discovered this is only for halo members (3.99/mo after trial of 6 months, I think) and the membership is not worth it when this is the only feature I like. So that's disappointing.I've never tried the tone feature or the movement feature. I did try the body fat calculator which was RIDICULOUS! I'm 5'7"" and at the time was about 167. Yes I was overweight but it calculated my bmi as 40, pretty much morbidly obese and at the very top of the BMI chart. And you have to enter your height and weight so how could it possibly think a 5'7"" woman at 167 was morbidly obese?? That just makes no sense to me. BMI was likely 29 or so.Giving 3 stars just bc I like the activity points so much (MAKE IT WHERE THEY'RE NOT JUST FOR MEMBERSHIPS, AMAZON!) and bc I like the look of the device on my wrist (some trackers are really ugly). It also holds a charge for a few days which is really nice.",3
139,"It does what it says it will do. The problem is every time you want to look at your stats you have to open up the app in order to see everything. And that's not what most people are used to an a fitness tracker and definitely not what I wanted in a tracker.  But I decided to give it a try for 6 months.  Cons: doesn't have a way to track food unless you eat what they suggest and doesn't track water. Some of the exercises don't take into account problem areas for people with bad knees, or hands, and sometimes when they show the modifications the exercise is almost done.Pros: suggestions for how to improve your mobility,  strength or reduce stress or mindfulness",4
140,"What do you want from Halo?I thought this was just another fitness tracker, then I saw the ""see how you sound to others"" feature and bought it.  Over the years I've had all the latest and greatest technology in smart watches and fitness trackers.  Frankly it's too much, to some degree, so is this, but I took on a management position about a year ago and have been told that I'm ""harsh"".  I already knew that.  I've read books, done the self help,  I think I've improved only to hear that I still sound harsh.Halo provided live feedback on my conversations and gave me overall feedback on my tone throughout the day. I was sad to see that I sound dismissive and annoyed but happy that I now have something that is actually ""catching me in the act"".  I've already had better conversations as a result.  The labs on voice app are targeted at meditation, I thought that they weren't helpful at first but I get the connection now.  I look forward to seeing more labs on public speaking and the limitless possibilities this could go.As far as sleep, I've questioned all of them, Halo backed up the same data I get from every one of them, I sleep about 4-5 hours a night.  Knowing this gives me sleep anxiety.Lastly I'll touch on the point system for exercise.  This one hurt my feelings.  With Apple I was able to set my own goals so I would set it insanely low and hit it every day, win!  Halo doesn't let me cheat, matter of fact I get docked points for my laziness.  Ouch.  This is both motivating and unmotivating at the same time.  I'm not interested in the fitness trackers, but they all insist on doing it.  If I can set a low goal and hit my targets I'd be more inclined to up it or let the app up it for me.  Going from Couch Potato to Marathon feels unattainable.  On the other hand the warrior in me wants to obliterate the goal and prove that I can do it, the problem being that I would only do it for a week.  It needs to be habit forming.",4
141,"I would give this 3 stars but I want to counter some of the bad reviews about the app not loading or wanting a screen. I'm giving it 4 stars because 1) If something isn't working email support! 2) How many times does the item description say it's meant to reduce distractions by not having a screen. If you want a screen then don't buy the Halo. 3) I saw a review about how hard it is to use the charging clip... it's not. It's like a chip bag clip with little dots that easily line up with the dots on the band. See pictures.Now for my review, I bought this for the heart rate monitor. It seems to be working well but I've noticed a few times exercising it goes offline due to sweat. The easy fix is to simply wipe the sweat off your arm and the sensor, double click button on the band, and you should be back in business.The sleep tracking is definitely not for those of us with sleep problems. Since I can't override the app's reporting, I get better sleep scores than reality. For example, last night I was awake twice - once for 30min and another for about 2 hours - but it only captured 90min of awake time. I do like seeing the difference between REM and deep sleep and have actually learned a lot more about my sleep issues.Body scan: Maybe I don't have privacy concerns but after reading the notices and agreeing, I was fine with my photos being taken in my workout shorts and sports bra. I think this feature needs to be improved. I'm very overweight and this has me at 49.3% but I'm pretty sure I'm over 50% based upon my BMI. I do think it has issues with very overweight females as our bodies have curves.I've really enjoyed the labs. I've tried a few different exercise programs and labs to improve my sleep. There is room for improvement on the lab interface (like being able to save or favorite a lab) but they seem to touch on improving your whole person.The main thing I'd like to see on a future update is the ability to change recorded data. I think a lot of the issues could be resolved by letting the user make changes and override what was recorded.I recommend this band for those looking for an affordable fitness tracker and for those who love data.",4
142,"I bought my halo before its release day on an invitation only preorder. It’s been great and I wear it all the time. It’s proven to be durable and fairly accurate.Downside: for the last couple of months, it is incredibly difficult to get it to sync with the app. I’ve reset it, deleted and reinstalled the app, done anything and everything and yet it works only when it feels like it. Some days it refuses to sync at all. This started happening after an app update so I’m guessing it’s a software issue with the app… too bad, and very annoying to say the least considering I pay for the monthly fee… maybe time to look at something else like Fitbit…",4
143,"Before using Halo Band I used an Apple Watch daily for 5 years. I love it and think it's the best *smartwatch* available, but at the end of the day I was mainly using it for the tracking features - specifically fitness tracking. I wanted to use it for sleep tracking as well, but from when I purchased it until today the battery only lasts around a single day so I'm not sure when Apple expected me to charge the device. I ended up charging overnight and missed out on sleep analysis.What I love about the Halo is it has all the tracking goodness that I appreciated about my smartwatch, but it stays charged for a full week (I don't use or care about the tone analysis).I can wear it completely passively and I don't need to fiddle with the band or the phone app to start an exercise or log anything - it just knows and logs when I'm sitting, walking, running, or sleeping automatically without me having to intervene. And I'm also not bound to charge it every evening or whenever.In addition, what I didn't expect was to notice how much I had become accustomed to glancing at my wrist for notifications. I like having a screen-free device that doesn't prompt me to look at it or take out my phone more. It changes the interaction of when I leave my phone behind, I can actually be disconnected without a wifi or LTE connected device on my wrist. So I'm *actually* leaving my phone behind without missing out on the data and tracking that I care about and that helps give me insight and metrics to live a healthier life.Love the Band, saw that they also have Halo View and very much hope that Amazon continues to iterate and improve on their passive tracker. Would love a successor without the mics (like the direction the View has gone) that can be even smaller and with an even longer battery.",5
144,"I waited a few months before I gave a review so I could test it against other devices (I'm a data analyst by day). I've divided my review between calorie burn and HR readings, body fat scans, and sleep tracking. I have yet to use the Tone feature due to its affect on battery life.Calorie Burn/HRAfter 2 months of testing HR and total calorie burn against a Fitbit Alta HR, a Garmin Vivosmart 4, and a Polar H10 chest strap (the most accurate measure), this device consistently came within +- 5% variance with the polar chest strap, while the Fitbit and Garmin were usually off by 20 to upwards of 50% when compared to the chest strap. Testing included high intensity work outs, jogs, weight lifting and rest days. I've tested other devices against chest straps in the past and this is the best accuracy I've seen yet. Way to go, Amazon!Sleep TrackingFitbit is known for being the best for sleep tracking. I had to get rid of my Fitbit as it was no longer compatible with my new phone. I could tell right off the bat the Garmin's metrics were off, as it didn't calculate brief awake times nor did it account for naps. The Halo, however, was much closer to Fitbit if not almost identical in sleep tracking, including awake times. Again, way to go, Amazon!Body Fat ScanningI compared my body fat scans to my Wyze body fat scale, which claims to be one of the most accurate for measuring body fat currently on the market. I measured on the same days/times and with the same clothing twice a month and each time, the Halo's measurements came within .5% of the Wyze scales reading. I was impressed and somewhat skeptical. I'm sure more methods could be used to compare but as far as what I used, it fared well.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I wish it had some smart features or at least a clock. I know that is the point of the thing, but for those of you that are used to your smart watches, it will definitely take some getting used to. Other than that, this is a pretty solid activity tracker as far as accuracy goes!",4
145,"I've been using the Halo for one week and I really like it. I like that it doesn't have a screen (no distractions). I knew this before I bought it, so no big deal. I didn't buy a fitness tracker to tell what time it is or to notify me that I have a text message.The sleep tracker is OK. Problem is, I have a hard time getting to sleep. I get into bed at 9 p.m. and sometimes can't fall asleep for an hour or two. The sleep tracker doesn't work those.hours into it's final sleep score. I don't think it starts tracking until I actually fall asleep 1 or 2 hours later. When I do fall asleep, it seems to track my sleep patterns pretty accurately.The body mass option was pretty much what I expected. No idea why some people think they need to be naked to use it. I wore my underwear, and the 3D image of my body was pretty spot on, as was the body mass score it gave me.I like the activity tracker. It motivated me to do more. However, I noticed tonight while I was eating spicy pickles, my heart rate went up (I guess because they were hot), and the Halo must have thought I was exercising. It added points to my daily activity tracker. I got 5 points just for sitting on the couch. It hasn't done that before. I'll update this review if I find this happens again.I don't use the voice tone option because it drains the battery and I already know when I'm upset, sad, happy, etc. I don't need a fitness band to confirm how I feel. When I used the voice tone option, I would only have about 50% battery when I went to bed. With it turned off, I have about 80% when I go to bed.The band feels ok, but I will say, I took it off a couple of nights because it felt like it was chaffing my wrist. Not bad, but a not something I need when I'm having trouble getting to sleep. During the day, however, it feels good. I normally forget I'm wearing it.Overall, I'm very happy I got this device. Knowing what I know now, I'd definitely buy it again.",4
146,"**Update** I wore this for 1 year and 2 months.  One day I found the back of the device laying on the floor.  It had become unattached while I was wearing the device.  The rubber glue was to stuck to my arm.  I never wore the device in the shower.  Never wore it under water (swimming, beach, etc...).  When I contacted Amazon to find out about a replacement (which was not the easiest thing to figure out!!) I was told the warranty was up.  I was credited 15%.  Although I liked the device, I will not be purchasing another.  I don't want to have to buy a new one every year.I had the other popular fitness tracker, but I really missed wearing my watches, so when this came out I was pretty happy.  I've been wearing it for about 7 months now.  I have not activated the voice tone monitoring and have no input on that feature.SLEEP - I found the sleep tracker is SO MUCH more accurate than the previous tracker.  I like the way it scores the sleep also.  It was also much more comfortable to sleep with it on.FITNESS - I really like the point system for activities, although I feel 150 points a week is pretty low and I am by no means a fitness freak.  I especially like how you loose points for sitting around and doing nothing.  Keeps me motivated.  I do miss the little buzzing reminder the last tracker gave me when I was not active enough in a hour.  As stated I am not a fitness freak, I do some light treadmill and body weight exercises.  I do enjoy DIY home improvement and the point tracker confirms that I'm working especially hard sometimes.BODY SCAN - As horrifying as this was to see, it truly gave a over all look at what my body shape was and how it could look with a little work.  I like this feature.  Nothing like accountability.LABS - This is where the the Halo fails me and why it only gets 4 stars.  Although I know Amazon is not responsible for the content in the Labs, I feel this where I should put my comments.  The first Labs I tried were from ""SWEAT.""  The exercises were good, but there is no notification at the end of each exercise to let you know you should me moving into a different position to start the next exercise.  Next thing you know, the instructor is counting out the next set.  You end up loosing the first 10-20 seconds of each exercise.Also, I would really like to see more Labs.  They seem limited right now and a majority of them are pretty basic.  I'm hoping the selection and options get better with time.CHARGER - I read lots of complaints about the charging time.  I have zero issues with charging.  I put the unit in the charger every morning when I take my shower.  I have never had the power go down below 50%, even if I miss a day.  However the charger itself is a star looser for sure.  I have the hardest time centering the Halo so the connection points meet.  Also, the clip is so smooth EVERY TIME I squeeze it together to put the Halo in, it shoots out of my fingers. EVERY. TIME.APP - I found the app easy to set up, read and follow.BAND - I like the material of the band.  It is comfortable to wear and easy to put on and take off.  The ""velcro"" is not super poky.  I picked the pink band, which I love the color of........if I could keep it clean.  Before I knew I could toss it in the wash, I would scrub it with soap and a soft brush.  I still stick with this method because it does not clean up enough in the washing machine.  Overall I very much like the band and I find the Halo to have a lower profile then the previous tracker making it more comfortable.",1
147,"To start, this is the first fitness tracker I've owned. Although I have a step-counter app on my phone, it's pretty basic. The Halo band is a whole different animal.The good:- The app is generally pretty good. It's easy to figure out what to do with it, usually.- It measures both activity and intensity. It has a point system (from the American Heart Association, I believe) that takes intensity into account, which is nice.- You can add in activity to the app if you forget to wear the band. (Although it will be generic, rather than taking into account your actual intensity at the time.)- It can be surprising. During my work from home period, it showed me just how little I was moving. (I should not have been surprised. When your workplace is about 15 feet away from your bed, you're not going to be moving much during the day. Still, it was helpful to see, numerically, just how bad things were.)- It can take photos to track both bodyfat and flexibility. (You may not like what it says, but the option being there is good, imho.)The so-so:- It only automatically recognizes certain activities, like walking, running, etc.- You can add other activities, but only retrospectively. So for example, you can say that you did weightlifting for time x to time y, but you can't push to start tracking a weightlifting session and then stop it at the end.- The sleep tracking is hit or miss, I find. It works perfectly well for a standard, go-to-bed-then-get-up-x-hours-later system. But if you get your sleep in scattered chunks (as I occasionally do) the system can't handle that.The bad:- Contact dermatitis. This is why I don't sleep with it on anymore. (And why I'm switching it to the other wrist, while the first one heals up.)The unknown:- The voice tracking feature. It sounds interesting in the abstract, but I find it kind of creepy. So I've never tried it.",4
148,"I don't typically write customer reviews, but wanted to share a 4 star rating as I've really liked this product since I received it a few weeks ago. What attracted me to the Halo Band vs. other fitness trackers was its minimalist design that is a low profile fabric look without a screen. I like to wear an automatic watch daily, and this has prevented me from ever wanting to buy an apple watch or fitbit as it seems like I would look ridiculous wearing two watch sort of devices concurrently. This product has solved that problem for me - I wear an automatic watch on my left wrist, and my Halo on my right. I like the software and tracking features - the move goal system is pretty motivating for me and its cool to see the massive impact exercise has on your overall daily movement. I did not buy it for the sleep tracking but have found I love that feature - with a young baby who wakes us up at night its helpful to pay attention to the amount of sleep I'm getting and helps me get to bed earlier vs. staying up late. I haven't really liked the voice feature so just turn it off and that's fine by me.The only thing that knocks this down 1 star for me is that eventually, I'm going to have to buy a membership which is sort of annoying, since I don't use the workout class feature (have a Peloton membership, don't need it), which seems like the only real feature i can see justifying a monthly price. I want the activity & sleep scores, as well as the body composition calculator which is cool too, which are important to me, and unfortunately require a membership.",4
149,"6/12/21::: I’m updating this because after reading recent reviews; I’m so confused how people are having so much trouble… it takes a time or two to line up the charging right and you just need to push it down a little and the red light will come on… nothing has fallen apart and my sleep is pretty accurate and I LOVE the fact it separates my REM and deep.The steps and activity are just as accurate as an Apple Watch and I’ve tested that multiple times. I’ve accidentally left it on for a shower and quickly got it off and nothing went wrong. I haven’t tried the Alexa integration, but over 6 months in and this thing still works great… I do know that about a month after I bought it, Amazon took it off for purchase so if they did something to it in between then, maybe because they did not originally have a rose good interface option. If you want a no frills and very easy to follow activity/sleep tracker this is great. If you’re looking for amazons version of an Apple Watch, THIS IS NOT IT nor is it the point of it.——I really like this option after trying multiple devices.. Apple Watch, the Amazon versions available like the Samsung watches, fitbits. Etc.I just wanted sleep tracking and proper steps. Read the reviews people did that compared to Apple step tracking and the accuracy is the same if not better. The sleep app is much better to me because it breaks down rem and deep. Light and awake. Much more data than I noticed on other things. I barely remember it’s on half the time. I’ve had no irritation.The app is great to use, the step tracking data is easy and nice to have. It measure the calories burned on my walk times and just records I’m on a walk so I don’t need to log it. It’s pretty intuitive and learns your patterns. I’ve been using it a couple of months. It’s super motivating bc I can check the app and keep up to date on my steps during the day. It’s simple, efficient and easy to use... and not all in your face or distracting. It also syncs nicely when your phone is either off Bluetooth or dead, you don’t miss a beat if you’re not near the phone. If the band is dead, then you do... charge lasts days. I charge once a week when I’m in the shower and it’s ready in less than an hour.I wish there were more bands available like just a plain black mesh one but maybe.The tone thing is kind of cool actually, I didn’t use it long enough bc it does drain the battery.",5
150,"I purchased the Amazon Halo after watching a few review videos comparing the WHOOP strap and the Halo. I've had my band for a little over a month.The halo has a few cool features that the WHOOP does not have. The body scan feature is pretty accurate when compared to my stats on the inBody machine.  I wasn't creeped out by this feature and feel like it is a good tracking tool if you are using macros/CICO to try to alter your body composition.I like the way that halo tracks your exercise and movement. You receive points for intensity in addition to your steps. My fitbit Charge 2 wasn't able to detect HIIT/CrossFit types of workouts. I didn't receive additional movement/exercise points on the fitbit. On the Halo's point system, you also lose points if you are sedentary for too long. The system works pretty well and is reasonable for all fitness level. Unfortunately, there is no current feature to help you analyze your workout recovery like the WHOOP offers. (Maybe one day, Amazon!)The Halo does not have a screen, but rather syncs to the Halo app. I like this feature and don't feel like I'm missing out.  I have had zero issues with charging, syncing, etc. The process is as simple as opening the app and waiting about 10 seconds for your data to appear. Charging takes about 30 minutes and I typically get 4 days before needing to recharge.I haven't played with the workouts as I follow a program already. At a glance of what is offered, there appears to be something for all fitness levels. I have tried the meditation work and the current program that I'm using is a bit repetitive. This is not necessarily a bad thing. I think it depends on your preference in guided meditation.I don't use the tone feature because I like to keep my battery charge longer. Overall, this fitness band is great. I prefer it over my fitbit for accuracy. The price is right and the monthly membership of $3.99 is very reasonable when compared to $30-$40 per month from competitors. The band is comfortable, light weight holds in place. I look forward to seeing how the Halo evolves.",4
151,"The band and unit is very comfortable. Cloth band fits better to my wrist than the standard plastic one's offered by other companies. The tracker is made of metal, and is comfortable on top or under one's wrist. Again, something different that the standard plastic trackers. There is no face to read, but there are two small light indicators that flash red and green. You can go 4-5 days with out charging. Charging is simple and fast.I really like the physical Halo itself. Since Fitbit did away with the clip on trackers, and no one offers a bluetooth clip on tracker, I've been in the market for a replacement. I don't like wearing bands/watches on my wrist. But this one works- the cloth feels like clothing, and once the tracker reaches body temperature it is not noticeable. When sleeping, it doesn't catch pillows or blankets. The green sensor light does flash while, but it is small and shielded by it position on the unit. I find it does not wake me up like the blue lights on other trackers.Sadly, the down fall of this package is the app. It is slick, doesn't crash. It's sync easily. But it features are lack IMHO.Sleep-  Does an excellent job of tracking sleep, with a nifty graph. But, the information is hinder by the fact you can't compare it on a weekly or monthly view. What it lack is any feedback telling you what to do with the data.Body Scan- This is cool. It makes a 3d image based off scanning your body and uses it to estimate you body fat percentage. Again, nice data, but there is a lack of follow through as to what to do with that data.Activity- Lots of data here, based on a points system. I find this data layout to be messy. And no follow through.Tone- records your conversation to help make suggestions how to improve how you sound. I have NEVER turned this on- this is a big negative the the unit. I have no idea why it is included on a fitness tracker.This unit generated data, but then leave it to you to do all the research into which ""lab""- guide goals you want to tackle. If this was an unpaid service, I'd be more forgiving. As a paid service, I would like to see Halo help uses my data to make suggestions for me. Also, adding a meal tracker would be nice.It would be nice to know if Amazon plans on allowing the Halo to connect to other platforms like MyFitnessPal.",3
152,"I was excited to see Amazon’s fitness tracker roll out and see how it compared to other fitness trackers I’ve used in the past. Sadly, I don’t think the Amazon Halo is quite ready for public use.I purchased the rose gold band and it’s already quite dirty looking, especially where it sits on my desk. When the band gets wet, it does not dry quickly so all the dust and grime stick to it. Plus when it’s wet and moves, it’s not smooth and feels painful. The halo hardware piece of the band it self also causes irritation periodically which causes me to remove the band all together. Which ends up working because the battery life is limited to two days with the tone tracker on. Meaning if you use the non in-depth tone tracker, you need to charge the halo every two days. If you use the in-depth tone tracker, it lowers it to just one day. Part of the reason I wanted to purchase the watch was the tone tracker. Sadly, the information I get from it, isn’t exactly helpful. It just says the time and how you sounded based on its limited emotions it can convey.The sleep tracking function is quite interesting. I feel the information I get from it, is the most useful however I do question the accuracy of it. In the mornings I get up and check it and then later on in the day I’ve noticed the number has changed from the time I got up. Sometimes it’s more or sometimes it's less. I only check the numbers once I’m fully awake for the day so I’m not sure why this number changes at all. Another big downfall of the Halo is that it does not track naps. As a big nap advocate, this is highly irritating as this is then just considered sedentary time and counts against me for the day.The step counter/activity monitor is also a bit odd to me compared to other trackers. It does not focus on daily goals but a weekly goal of 150 points. The 150 goal is reached by doing light, moderate, or intense activity. For every one minute of intense activity you get two points. For moderate, it is an even one of one in points and for light activity it is one point for 20 minutes. Now here’s the kicker, for sedentary activity over 8hrs, it subtracts one point, per hour. To me, I find the sedentary activity very de-motivating.Lastly, the body scanner is great! However it is part of the paid subscription, which I would not keep once my free trial is over. The mobile app, where you can access all this information, also has several “labs” you can utilize during the free trial. I’ve done a few workout and meditation ones and would rather just use YouTube than the ones provided. The labs are also part of the subscription service as well. The app also does not sync with ANY other fitness apps as it’s so new so I found I’m still entering in a lot of the information to the fitness apps.Overall, the step count is good but the activity tracker randomly puts in ""workouts"" when I've done anything to raise my heart rate. For example, carrying furniture up the stairs caused it to put in a 20 minute exercise? I think there are some good parts to the Amazon Halo but I definitely don’t intend on keeping the subscription and if I had to pick between the Halo and the Fitbit, I’d go with the Fitbit.",2
153,"Does what it sais for it's basic health and walking functions, if all your looking for is to see your sleep  and health this is great. The battery lasts a long time as well, also comfortable wrist band.",5
154,"I've been wearing my Halo for a little over a month. I wore a Bellabeat shortly years ago, but otherwise haven't used an activity tracker like a fitbit. Getting used to wearing the band was a challenge, but even as someone with very sensitive skin I'm not having any problems with irritation on my wrist. I get about a week out of each charge.I was excited to try the body scan. The first time I tried it my % body fat would change based on what clothes I wore for the pictures. It also doesn't know the different between bloat and body fat, so my results changed drastically from night to morning (1.5%). I've been trying to only do scans when I feel less bloated to have better baseline, but my confidence in it's ability to measure accurately just isn't there.I really like the activity portion being more than just steps. I call it my mean activity tracker because if I sit too long it takes points away, which for me is a motivator. An issue for me is that although it connects vis Bluetooth, it needs internet for the app to work. I've been on a hike and looking to check my live HR and was very disappointed that the app is useless without internet. All tracked data uploads when you return to cell service, but it's a piece of functionality that I feel like should work without internet.Sleep tracker has been fun to see, but after a few weeks of realizing how I feel about my sleep generally matches up, it isn't as useful. I also would love if I could give it input. Sometimes it thinks I'm still sleeping in the morning when I'm just on my phone in bed. I would love to be able to edit what it tracked to match what happened.I have not tried the tone function at all. Past the first week I also haven't found myself looking at the programs. It's easy to just put the thing on, check the immediate information on the data screen and not dig deeper. I'm not seeing the app give any type of specific actionable insights or recommendations other than listing a bunch of generic things to try. And even the places it gives recommendations (like sleep habits) can be skewed by my point above that it doesn't always track my awake/asleep right. Bad data in = bad data out so giving feedback/manual changes would be helpful. I need to take advantage of more of the workouts/meditations/etc that are provided to give better feedback.",3
155,"I wear this and my Apple Watch for different reasons. My Apple Watch is better for tracking workouts, telling the time and I do feel is generally a better fitness tracker, but the huge downfall is the the battery only lasts part of the day so I am not getting the full scope from that tracker. I love the daily scores that halo gives, I find them really affirming and motivating! The battery lasts a Long time and I can trust that it is tracking me passively without any distractions. Fitness and sleep seem pretty accurate, tone- while fun and interesting seems a little vague it might be more helpful ( it also more creepy) if it let me know what I said or why I was interpreted as happy, or annoyed…The membership is decent priced and has a lot of great stuff! I love looking through the recipes, workouts and labs. I wish I could select one audio though (ie- relaxing melodies, instead of having to commit to a full week or whatever duration the lab is).Three suggestions to take it from good to great:1) Add a body feedback monitor which is a combo of physical exertion, sleep, and heart rate response (to stresses) it can show as a ring as the other monitors do and would be great if it make suggestions like- gets some more sleep, recover, try to medicate or take some calming exercises…2) cycling tracking for women using cycles and body temperature to predict ovulation and periods is nice3. Alternative ways to wear it. Since I also wear my Apple Watch I sometimes feel silly wearing two fitness trackers at the same time. I might like to wear this one on my ankle or find a comfortable way to wear both on the same wrist without them rubbing each other and the feeling of being weighed down by fitness trackers.",4
156,"If you're looking for a device to keep track of your sleep with a rough estimate then this is a decent device.I toss and turn alot and it's helped me ween of certain foods and lifestyle choices in order to get a good night's sleep.Software:Short summary:The tone feature is interesting, the activity tracker is very weak  and the body scanner just looks off.Longer summary:The sleep tracker was useful for me.The tone tracker was nice when I was communicating with my customers and clients as I talk all day long. But I had to make sure that the mic was on and the tone increased to more activity.The body scanner just looks akward and can drastically be improved on with better lighting techniques and enhancing software to better give a appealing look. Using the camera to only render a similar 3D model would be a better approach to this feature.The Activity tracker could also use an up to date quality of life update when or if they decide to pursue a 2nd version of this device. It does keep track of your steps, you will have to manually input any activites you are doing and tbh was more of a hassle to actually use on real situations. I go to the gym regularly and I've decided to cut the feature entirely as it wasn't helpful, and more of a hindrance.About the pyshical device.Short summary: clunky, might be bigger on smaller arms and uncomfortable. The charger is just silly, a pain to actually hook up and charge properly. Where I have had multiple times it did not charge and I went a couple of days without it.Longer summary:The battery is almost comical how short it lasts. The device is small so the battery would be small as well common sense would direct you, but I've seen devices last much longer doing more, this could have been designed on multiple levels and configurations to better suit different lifestyle groups.I purchased the white activity band to go along with the device. Not too much of a hassle to change.  The bands are interesting and pretty cool.All and all, I would recommend this device if you're looking for something other than a smart watch and which in my opinion is just a ridiculous device.Worth the money if your looking to expirence and try something new and have the cash to throw at Jeff  & the team behind this device.",3
157,"I have had my Halo band for around 4 months now.  It has some nice features but a number of issues that lessen the experience.On the positive side, the app is easy to use and well laid out.  The graphics are easy to read at a glance and the additional details are very helpful.  The main functions are Activity, Sleep, Tone and Body.My favorite is the Sleep monitor, letting you track your time asleep and the quality of that sleep.  I have noticed that sometimes my sleep score gets adjusted later in the day.  I typically check it right after I get up in the morning, and later I will see that it has changed.  Perhaps the monitor recalculates based on activity after I have been awake for a few hours, but I do not know why this would be.The biggest issue I have is with the Activity monitor.  It is good at tracking cardio activity such as running, Tennis etc, but very poor at tracking workouts that involve weight/resistance training.  Part of this is due to the fact that the heart rate monitor is inaccurate during times when you ""frequently clench your fist - such as during HIIT, weight lifting and functional fitness activities"" (from the Halo Troubleshooting section).  There are also times when the heart rate monitor is in fact showing my rate is consistently in the moderate or intense zones, but few or no points are recorded in the activity monitor.  30-45 minutes of a hard workout can result in being awarded 5 or less points.  You can add the activity manually, but that defeats the purpose of a wearable tracking device.The body analysis is interesting and I have used it a few times.  I do not know how accurate it is as I have nothing to compare it to, but it could be a useful tool for monitoring changes over time.I have the winter/silver band and it gets dirty easily (though it also cleans fairly easily).  I would recommend against following the guidelines to order the larger band if you are in between sizes.  I got the large per Amazon's recommendation and it was a mistake.  There is too much overlap at the end of the band and it catches on things such as sleeves and pockets.I do not plan on renewing my Halo membership when the free period ends and will likely stop wearing the band except for specific activities.",3
158,Love that this is a cheaper version of the whoop band but it still has the capabilities i would want. I don't think the tone detection is worth it because it drains the battery in like a day. BIGGEST complaint is that this thing starts to smell!!!! And I mean the actual device piece not the band. I workout every day and I take off the band when I shower and I take off the piece and clean it with micellar water and it'll start to noticably smell in a day again. Not sure what kind of technology is needed to improve this but this has made me wear it less frequently,4
159,"I loved the app and how I was able to do the body scan for body fat estimation and the sleep info it gave me. It detected my sleep better than my Apple Watch. I found it to be pretty accurate in terms of detecting my sleep and detecting my activities without having to start a workout like on the Apple Watch. It gave me different info from my Apple Watch so I wore both in order to make a good comparison. The number of steps were not too far off from my Apple Watch seeing as I wore halo on my dominant hand vs the Apple Watch on my non dominant hand. The difference was within 10% difference which is to be expected.However, I will be returning mine because I got an allergic reaction to it where the device touches my skin. I also did everything that I saw in the faq's like loosening the band for better air circulation, cleaning the sensor/charging area, leaving it off the wrist for an hour a day, etc but every time I put it back on I would end up with a rash within 24 hours. It really is unfortunate because I really liked it and wish it would have worked out.Would give it 5 stars if I wasn't allergic to the metal. Maybe if Amazon uses a metal I'm not allergic to, I will try it again.",3
160,"I really love this band.The sleep tracking function is great. I like knowing what stage of sleep I have been in, for how long, and how long it took to fall asleep. It is also helpful to know how many times I woke up during the night.The activity monitor is really nice. I like how it tracks different levels of physical intensity and if you are seditary to long it will deduct points. Plus it has the obligatory step counter.The only issue that I have I the voice recognition. First, it drains your battery even if you only have it on the sample occasionally mode. With the voice on, I have to recharge at least every other day. Without the voice, I can go 4 to 5 days between charges. The other issue with voice is that for some reason, it loves to 'sample' my tone when I am conversing with the TV or my pets. LOL That really throws off the metrics.It does have a really, really cool function where you take a couple of pictures of your body 'scans' and it calculates your body fat. It gives you reminders every 2 weeks to rescan so you can see your progress (or be depressed about how little has changed) but if you are depressed....they have meditation and motivation programs too. Plus healthy eating recipes and workouts.Really it is a great product, I just wish the voice thing worked better. I would totally recommend this to a friend. BYW..I have also had both a Fit bit and a Whoop, so I have some experience with these type of products.",5
161,"PROs:I like the points system instead of just steps a lot. It tracks time and effort instead of distance, which just seems a lot more intuitive. I get an A for taking time, even if I suck at the actual exercises.I like that it doesn’t buzz, flash, or do anything else to try to get my attention. If it needs something, it just pushes a notification to my phone. No interruptions at work!So comfy!  I really like the stretchy cloth band, and it is easy to take off. I do wish it was a bit thinner (it’s like an inch wide, which seems huge on my wrist), but it’s okay.The bands are super easy to switch out and the cloth ones are MACHINE WASHABLE. I don’t know why they haven’t made this a selling point, because have you seen how gross a typical Fitbit band gets?  Ever had a rash from your Fitbit’s gross band?The labs are actually pretty cool. So far I like them, and I’m thinking I will keep paying the monthly fee for them after the trial you get with the purchase. However, not all of the “beginner” exercises are really beginner (show me the person who can do a downward facing dog their first day of yoga) or appropriate for all body types. We aren’t all 25 year old waifs, Amazon.  I hope more are coming, including some that work on changing thoughts about eating, or maybe some radical body positivism.CONs:Battery life. Dear god, this sure wasn’t in the product description. You have to charge it every other day. If you use more tone (I use less tone), you have to charge it DAILY.Does not connect to Apple Health, which means all the other apps you have that would like your pedometer info can’t have it. With only two apps on the list to share info with (Weight Watchers and John Hancock), this is a serious problem. Like, as much as I love this band, I am going to hate it after awhile if it won’t play with anything else.You cannot manually edit your sleep. So, if it makes a mistake, you can’t correct it, which messes up the day’s stats and any labs you are working on. It makes quite a lot of mistakes, especially thinking meditation is sleep.NEUTRALs:Tone. I was sort of cautiously optimistic about this, and so far it seems to be a little “eh.”  All I’ve learned is that I always sound shy/restrained and that I talk in my sleep.  I actually sort of wonder if there are gender differences in the algorithm.Time it takes to go to sleep. It’s wildly inaccurate but also sort of unclear what/how it decides you are actually going to sleep now. So maybe it isn’t as wildly inaccurate as I think if it can tell when I’m laying in bed reading versus actually trying to go to sleep?SIX MONTH UPDATE:I had to get a replacement Halo from Amazon because my original one stopped charging after about five months. Even the replacement one is a bit dodgy getting it to charge half the time. Given how many people seem to be complaining about this problem, it’s apparently common. That’s really, really disappointing.I finally figured out how to turn Tone completely off, so I get about a week per charge. That’s better, but I’m mighty annoyed that I have to turn off a major function just to make the darn thing work.I’m still manually inputting my step data into Apple Health every day, and lets just say that is really darn annoying. They said they would improve it and add more apps as time went on—they haven’t. It’s still just Weight Watchers & John Hancock. No Noom, no MyFitnessPal, nothing else.I still love the comfy, easy-to-launder bands, but ultimately this tracker has gone from a four-star product to a one-star because it seems like more work than just buying another tracker that would integrate with other apps.I’m disappointed.",1
162,"I wanted a band to track my daily moves and sleep.This does that and subtract when you don't move, so if you are still at work. The gives points for using the offers on the application,which like I said are subtracted for stillness. Walking in place doesn't count. Small points for walking. It doesn't count laying in the bed  ,so I go to bed 2 hours before it records time to go to sleep.",3
163,"1. The band is actually softer than I had expected! So many reviews were made about the band being rough, but it feels amazing actually. If you're having problems with such an amazing band, then you are just too sensitive. For the average person, the band will feel great! UPDATE (6/5/21): The band is still great, but I wish it was waterproof! The amazon halo is swim-proof, but the band is not waterproof since it is made of some sort of fabric. I can’t even wear it right after a workout in the shower.2. Wow, body recognition is amazing. There definitely is a privacy concern in my opinion because I'm basically giving Amazon data on what my body looks like.... However, it does feel a little weird. That being said, it is really accurate. It is like an exact replica and I love it. Amazon Halo is the only band that had this feature so I purchased it. UPDATE (6/5/21): The body recognition still works great, but its getting repetitive. Unless you are actually in the middle of gaining muscle or losing weight, changes in my body are so slight, that it seems repetitive now.3. I love the 150 points feature! It promotes everyday, regular activity and it's amazing. It must use the steps plus heart rate to determine intensity because the points given varies. I've read reviews that the points are accurate, etc. Try making sure the heart beat count is correct. maybe you wore it wrong or it is too loose. Otherwise, it may be a defect. How accurate it will be in the long run, I will have to check as well, but so far I love it. UPDATE (6/5/21): Although the point system still seems to be pretty accurate, the steps I’ve noticed are not. The band over counts and will even count steps when I am just sitting down.4. I have yet to try out the tone analysis feature mostly because I am afraid the battery will drain. I will let you all know when I use it.5. Mobile app is beautiful. Well done Amazon!UPDATE SUMMARY after few months / weeks:1. Wish band was waterproof so I could shower and swim in it.2. Steps aren’t as accurate as it could be3. Body composition gets repetitive and boring if you’re not in the middle of losing weight or gaining muscle.",3
164,"First and foremost, you do not need to be ""near-naked"" for the Body Scan. I wear shorts and a full coverage top, and it works just fine. You also do not have to use it if you don't want to! Second, you do not have to use Tone. That was the one feature I was concerned about and knew I wouldn't use. You have to actively turn on Tone to use it.I've been wearing the Halo for two months now, and I'm happy with it. I wasn't looking for a Fitbit or an Apple watch alternative. Those are completely different products. I wanted something that would track sleep and activity, but was less distracting. I don't want constant feedback from my wrist. Personal preference.I think sleep data quality has improved dramatically from October. I ran into issues early on with naps and my couch potato behavior on weekends. It seems like my band has finally figured out when I've actually gone to bed for the night. I'm a notoriously bad sleeper, so I get a lot of value out of seeing my light and deep sleep, REM, and when I've woken up/gone to sleep.As far as Activity goes, it's given me a bit of a wake up call as to how little I move during the day. The tracker shows your activity by hour - sedentary, light, moderate, intense. Working from home has eliminated most of my walking during the day, so it's a good reminder to at least walk up and down the stairs a few times so I'm not sedentary for 8+ hours a day. Seems obvious, but I really didn't notice the change on my own.I actually like the Body Scan a lot. I'm trying to get healthier, and I think the Body Scan just gives me a better perspective of what my body actually looks like. It certainly doesn't feel like it's shaming me in any way. I take it as another piece of feedback that goes along with my weight, exercise, sleep, and general energy.All in all, I'm happy with the band. I think kinks will continue to be worked out (similar to all trackers on the market) and hope to keep getting value out of the band.",4
165,"This is not for the hard core or those that want all of the bling of a watch, with hundreds of apps.  This is simply a fitness device.  That is why I like it.

166,"I've been using Halo since before it was officially released, and I finally have enough data to decide whether or not it was a good purchase.For Sleep: I wear both the Halo and the Oura Ring. The point differences between my sleep scores across both apps is between 5 and 15 regularly. I sort of get this difference because the Oura ring hired the Sleep Diplomat himself, Dr. Matthew Walker, to consult on it. However, the Halo doesn't really provide feedback like it should. If I was only using the Halo, I wouldn't know how to correct a bad night's sleep based on the feedback given by Halo except to try their meditation app. And there are many more factors to a good night's sleep than just pre-bed meditation.For Exercise: I compared the performance of the Live Halo app and my Precor heart rate chest strap, and Halo lags behind at least 20bpm for dozens of seconds or even minutes. In many cases, intense heart rate zones don't register at all, so my end-of-workout scores and caloric burn are far lower than they should be. It's frustrating when I'm really out of breath to look at the Halo app and see it registering 80-90bpm, when I know I'm closer to 130bpm. If you're closely measuring your caloric intake and output for weight loss or any other goals, your output scores will be way off.The strap: This has got to be the most frustrating tracker to put on and take off. The strap has these ""speed bump"" ridges for some reason that defy usability best practices.Inter-app Sharing: This is a pretty closed system by comparison to something like a Fitbit, which can integrate with your MyFitnessPal, Google Fit, Runkeeper, Strava, Weight Watchers, etc. apps.. Halo integrates with TWO apps: Weight Watchers and John Hancock Vitality. That's it. I have to manually plug my workout scores into my other apps.The positives:The price: If you're just starting out on a health journey and you don't have a lot of money to invest in tracking, this is probably a good initial step. The $4 per month membership fee is annoying considering that other apps are free, but it's relatively nominal. If you've never done anything for your health before, Halo isn't perfect, but it's more than enough to get your journey started.The form factor: I hate wearing watches. I don't like how they feel on my wrist. If the watch face is too broad, it feels like shackles to me. But the form factor on the Halo is quite narrow, and it doesn't bother with any sort of display. Some people might hate this, but let's be honest, if I want to know what time it is, I'll just look at my phone. When I switch to a different product, which is highly likely, I'll go with this narrow form factor again.All in all, I wouldn't purchase the Halo again. Amazon (just like with Echo and it's terrible voice recognition) hasn't done nearly enough to upgrade the firmware or the experience to justify the ongoing costs.",2
167,"I'm still not completely sold on this, but I'm trying because my doctor wants me to track my heart rate while exercising.The physical device: As someone who hates having a watch on, this device seems... tall... on my wrist. Plus, it doesn't wrap around my wrist very well so there is an odd gap. I haven't tried other brands, so maybe this is normal? I do like that there isn't a ""face"" to the device so I can't scratch it up (something I always did when I wore a watch). Also, be careful about what band size you get -- I ordered larger than I probably need and Amazon wouldn't let me exchange it. It works so I'm living with it.Tone: I could see how this could be good for some people, but it wasn't really for me. I'm not sure how, but somehow it got turned off in the app and I haven't tried to turn it back on -- the battery lasts SIGNIFICANTLY longer without it.Sleep: It shows a neat little chart of the sleep cycles you went through, but I can't find out how to zoom in so I can look more specifically at the times. Also, I'm not 100% convinced how accurate it is. Most days I feel like it's fairly accurate, but every once in awhile it says something that doesn't make sense -- for example, one day it said I was awake for a significant amount of time during the night and I have no memory of that. Again, I'm not familiar with other brands/devices so maybe it's normal to have a fluky night periodically.Activity monitoring: This I feel like is pretty accurate and it's nice to see how my exercise ranks. And having the point system is motivating. And the heart monitoring helps.Body scan: Can't judge on this because I've only taken the original photos and haven't done any follow up photos.Would I buy again? Ehhh not sure -- but I'm also not sure I'd bother switching brands. And I'm still wearing it every single day so I guess that says something about it.",4
168,I really love that I can check my heart rate and track my sleep. I especially love the tone feature. I didn't quite realize the way my voice reflects my mood. I haven't tried all the features yet though. Also the band is very comfortable.,5
169,"Before purchasing the Halo I used the Whoop for a 30 day trial. The Halo is the better choice for the average person.What is better about WhoopThe thing I really miss about the Whoop is that you could easily charge it while it was on your arm. Whoop has a small battery external to the wrist band that ""shuttles"" the electricity to your arm. Whenever your whoop strap is low you attach the battery to it for a couple of hours, it refills the arm band and you are done. Halo needs something similar. Both wrist bands need you to wear it all the time to get the full experience. With Halo, because I use the voice monitor feature, the battery drains really quickly. So I need to charge it every day but my normal 15 min shower dress routine isn't enough to fully charge it. So I am having to figure out when I can charge it and that's a pain. Sometimes I leave it charging longer only to forget about it and then I have missed half a day of monitoring--which really messes up some of the stats--particularly the calorie count.What is better about HaloOverall, I love the Halo.One big plus is Halo's system for counting activity points. Very easy to follow and use and the system makes sense to me. For me (and most people I think) this is far better than Whoop's focus on measuring strain. If you are focused on improving your health (vs maxing out your athletic performance) the activity point system is great.In terms of comfort of wearing each Halo also is better. I bought the regular arm band for each. In Whoops case I was always trying to get the perfect tightness and at night it was sometimes uncomfortable because my arm would swell a bit naturally. The arm band for the Halo is better and always feels comfortable to me.Of course there is also the obvious differences: voice and body fat.Whoop doesn't measure your voice. I haven't gotten a lot of value out of this but I find it helpful as a reminder that my overall well being is in large part determined by how I approach my conversations with others. Like the sleep monitor, the conversation monitor provides extra data that in and of itself is probably of limited value. But by providing a numeric score for something I might not otherwise focus on, it reminds me to make an effort to  keep this where it should be.",5
170,"After 6+ months of wearing the band daily I feel like I can draw conclusions about the product and give my opinion about the accuracy , ease of use and programs.Please beware of the people that say it’s impossible to get the necessary 150 activity points. It is False, they probably don’t move enough within their home. Nothing easier as a matter of fact. I am comparing Halo with 2 Garmin watches I’ve had during the last 6 months. My first garmin watch was 5 years old so when the data was way off I thought in the beginning it was my watch and not the Halo, but then I got a brand spanking new Garmin Venu and lo and behold I realized Halo was off on all its metrics and tracking.A 10 min walk, timed will usually show on Halo at least 12-18 min longer. Steps at the end of the day compared to Garmin and to a pedometer are wayyyyy of…. I mean like 2000-5000 steps off with Halo always showing more.I am the most unhappy with the sleep tracking. It is so inaccurate it hurts. On days I know I sleep 7+ or 8+ hours Halo doesn’t show more than 5-6hrs in the average range, I am a very good sleeper so I know I can’t be averaging 5ish hours a night when I’m in bed at 10 and wake up at 7, no insomnia or sleepless nights usually involved.Programs. I love them! Best part about the band, probably the only reason it’s still on my hand. I’ve completed fully 10 programs with most of them being 3-4 weeks and another 2 I dropped out of because I didn’t care for them. There’s a program for everyone and this is why Halo gets the stars. Either you want to start walking or exercising more intensely you can find something. I am a huge fan of the mindfulness programs by Headspace, they are really great and range from 2 min to 30 min so there’s no excuse not too try if you’ve been eyeing a meditation program.Halo has a great concept but it needs lots of work done. For someone active that cares about tracking their activity and sleep this is not a good device.",3
171,"I've worn these for about a month, as I got the early access. After a month, I decided to return this. (By the way, Amazon does not offer free return for my early access purchase. So I need to drive to one of their collection center at 20-minute away)Here's my observation so far.1. Bad battery life. As a device with no screen, I expect this to last more than Fitbits. My 3yr old Fitbit can last a week without charging and it has screen on it.  With mic turned on (in less frequent voice check mode), this thing only last 1.5 days. Disabling the mic doesn't offer a week without charging. So essentially you need to charge this thing every day. I've been doing it between shower and sleep because I wanted to use the sleep track feature, and I had to leave it in the charger for night when I forgot to put it on before going to bed.2. Inaccurate sleep track. Again comparing to Fitbit, sleep tracking is far less accurate. It doesn't even recognize when I actually fall asleep, and it NEVER recognizes nap time. Fitbit has never failed to recognize nap time, so I think this shows a flaw in Halo's algorithm in sleep tracking.3. Inconsistent voice analysis. This feature is unique in the industry and it is Halo's main selling point. However, I think this is nothing more than a cute gimmick as of now. I consistently saw that I have conflicting moods (happy - angry) in the same time (with exact same time stamp in minutes), and things that actually doesn't make any sense. I am speaking foreign language at home, so this may be a contributing factor but I see similar pattern in my zoom meeting times.4. Body fat measurement. Another marketing bullet point. I thought/expected this feature is using some revolutionary technology to measure body fat from the device. Instead, they offer it by analyzing a photo of semi-naked body. Not only I'd never wanna share a photo of my naked body to Amazon, it is super awkward/inconvenient to take a photo without any assistance. Well, even if you have somebody at home to do it, I wouldn't imagine it's going to be a pleasant experience.5. So what's left is a bracelet with no screen that tracks your steps and heartbeat. Guess what? There are gazillions of cheap devices out there that do exactly this, with much better battery life.",3
172,"I love this for the fact that it has no screen and is not a smart watch. I HATE constant notifications on my wrist and I wear an actual non smart watch on my left wrist already. I had an Apple Watch, which I loved, even with its awful battery, but I don’t want to wear two watches. I looked into both Oura ring and Whoop strap before finding this. Whoop measured metrics I don’t care about, and Oura is too big for my small fingers so this was the winner. I love the design, it’s not overly large on my tiny wrists, and I love the Velcro strap for the same reason, I can actually make it fit. Jawbone and fitbits and other off brand trackers never fit my wrists so they don’t measure right. I also like the sleep tracker, it seems pretty accurate for me, and I love the body fat scanner. I find halo had a good selection of actually useful metrics, plus the option for workouts etc if you don’t already subscribe to a fitness app like iFit, peloton, or Apple health +. The ability to broadcast heart rate live to Bluetooth plus exercise machines is also handy.That being said- I’m not entirely sure how accurate the points are. Sometimes I get moderate or vigorous activity right after I wake up just for doing my morning hygiene routine. And the other day I did a 36 minute high intensity bike ride on iFit that left me wobbling and out of breath and I only got credit for 16 minutes high intensity of that one.Furthermore, I wish this synched with Apple health. IFit finally joined up so it synchs my rides and yoga now, but my halo won’t add my heart rate into Apple health.5/5 for screenless non-smart watch design, and performance potential, as well as a great app, but 3/5 overall due to lack of Apple health integration, and possibly not the most accurate activity tracking. I feel like it will eventually integrate though, and Amazon will make improvements, so I will happily stick with halo.",3
173,"I've fairly consistently used my Halo for a year and a half, but now the sensor cover has fall off so it's unusable.I never wore it for the rigorous activity it's supposedly made for. I just liked to track my daily activity and nightly sleep. I'm not sure if the membership is really worth what you get. At a certain point, I already knew essentially what it would tell me. It was still pretty fun to use while it lasted, but for $4/month, I'm not sure I'd do it again.",3
174,"Absolutely my top choice and recommended fitness/ lifestyle tracker! I have used multiple other products over the years, including numerous models of Fitbits, assorted branded trackers, wrist-based as well as ones that circle your chest:The Halo is perfect for my needs!I have a chronic condition that impacts all body systems and heart rate is a key part of the domino effect of my symptom cascade:This device has been incredibly accurate in its data tracking, as I manually double checked numerous times when I first began using it - whether my heart rate goes low or very high (150+ beats per minute), it provides the correct information.The sleep tracking and insights have been far better than I had with my Fitbits, again - I have a sleep disorder and I was highly skeptical that this device would be any more accurate than other trackers- but it IS! It breaks down my sleep cycles and tracks length of time/sleep very well, and having the app with the display of time in each type of sleep is wonderfully helpful in helping to adjust my routines to improve sleep quality.The voice tone feature is a bonus and is a useful tool for helping me recognize how I’m coming across to others - I tend to sound angry (always have known that) but this helps with awareness and ways to adjust my patterns for improved communication.The app is simply great: besides all of the data and graphs (which are easy to read and well explained, in my opinion), it offers programs in a wide variety of areas, to help you on your health and fitness journey- I’ve used a LOT of them, from stretching routines to speaking from a different perspective, to meditations, and they are programs with a start/finish timeline to help you keep “on track” with your goals.It’s water resistant and I’ve worn it in the shower as well as in pools with no damage to the device.It also charges VERY quickly when needed, which has averaged every 2-3 days for me (I have it on high use settings however so I use the battery more rapidly than an average user).The band is comfortable and has not irritated my skin after months of continuous wear.If you need a visible screen at all times? This is not the device for you - there is no screen on the device, purposely, so you’re not constantly looking at it. I appreciate that feature very much. You *can* see real time data by opening the app on your phone, if you wish to monitor your heart rate etc.",5
175,"I bought two of these, one for me and one for my daughter, 18.  We regularly use them and have had no problems.  We’ve found that it does as it said it would do.  There are things that we would like improved, and one is the number of diet programs that link to it.  Currently there are only two: weight watchers and John Hancock Vitality.  I would personally like to see more.  We got them for approximately $68 which is an introductory price and the Halo is compared to one of the FitBit’s that sell for $99, currently.  I like that it has no face to it, so it looks like a cloth bracelet but it has to work with the app and my phone is Boost Mobile and we can’t get service just everywhere, so that’s not a good feature.  The premium app is free for 6 months and then it costs $3.99 per month per person.  I just ordered a Smart Watch for my husband that has everything on screen like a wrist watch.  It was recommended by his sister with everything easily accessible.  I won’t know for a while how good it works, but it was $49.95 and also has a phone app.Update: the charger doesn’t always catch with the watch; we’ve tried a number of things including cleaning the charger and watch adapter.  Fortunately, we have two chargers.  I’ve also found that without knowing my stats until I see the app online, I forget I’m wearing it.  I can go a whole day without looking to see how I’m doing, and that’s not necessarily good to for a beginner - I believe I would pick up my pace a bit if it were more noticeable.  Not seeing it would be better for someone whose already set in a healthy pattern and just validating it each day.",4

 I've been using this for just over a month.  The benefits I've personally experienced are below.* Having to think twice before speaking, knowing I'm being judged based on my tone of voice.  Who can't benefit from a second thought or more before speaking?  After all, I've been given two ears and just one mouth.* Seeing my body on screen vs mirror is a motivator.  I'm sure we've all experienced this, where a photo of us snaps us back to reality vs our own perception of ourselves.  Who hasn't said, ""Is that how I looked?""* I've not just lost weight but have also seen results in body composition, albeit small.  But a loss in body fat is encouraging.With all this said, I'm also new to the body tech world.  So, not able to compare it to fit or apple.  Truthfully, I got the band worried about the quality of my sleep.  I'm not too convinced it's working perfectly to track my sleep or lack there of.  I felt tired more often than not, even after a ""great"" night.The problem with the band started a few weeks back.  The band stopped showing the proper colors (red vs green) while charging.  Every color was white or slightly off.  I reached out to support and was told to do a hard reset of the device, delete the Bluetooth pairing, and deregister the band in the app.  After following these steps, things worked for a few weeks.  Last Thursday, the unit suddenly stopped syncing.After trying to troubleshoot the same way and failing to fix the issue, I reached out to support again.  The video shows the issue.  It starts charging, then blinks white 3 times before cycling again.  Unsurprisingly, they told me to follow the same steps already taken.  When I then called and asked for a replacement, the support person told me that a replacement wasn't available and the only thing I could do was return the unit.Totally bummed because, I had already started touting the great benefits of halo... Now, I need to go eat my words on other forums.  Thanks Amazon.I give 3 stars because when it worked, it seemed fine... It's also motivated me to move and speak kinder.  Both positives.  But not lasting but a few months, very sad... I'm forced to look elsewhere or just go without.",3
177,"UPDATE AGAIN: One star again. Not accurate. Amazon is great and took back the 1st one I purchased and sent a second new one. The one I returned started ignoring my exercise. Now the new one is doing the same thing.  The bad thing is I like the simplicity of the APP and dread going back to a FITBIT. Yesterday after rowing and Nordic Trak for 50 minutes Halo only registered 5 TOTAL POINTS. Very disheartening.  I'd row 20 minutes, burn 240 calories and the Halo would only register 2 points one day and 12 points the next day. Same with the Nordic Trak. 30 minutes, 400 calories, but Halo only registers 4 or 5 points.  Then 20 or 30 the next day. My Airdyne bike,  30 minutes, 350 calories would register 38 points and is pretty consistent.  A 2-mile walk 38 points. It makes no sense. I'm burning a lot more calories on my Nordic Trak in 30 minutes than a two-mile walk with my wife. SOmething buggy about the Halo hardware. PREVIOUS UPDATE WHICH I RETRACT: The few features Halo has works ok. So it isn't fair to rate it with 1 star. The app is simple and seems to work well. I've had the Haloband for 1.5 months. I've religiously used it. The iPhone app is very simple, but works well, and supports the limited features on the band effectively.  The problem with Halo is that compared to other fitness bands, it is poorly featured. Consider, for $100  you can get a touch screen, O2 sensor, Blood Pressure, heart rate, skin temperature, and longer battery life. Halo has no screen and only heart rate and the battery dies in two days and Halo charges$100 and plans to charge a monthly fee. Why is Halo so expensive? With the features Halo offers it would have been competitive 5 years ago if they sold it for $20.Those people comparing Halo to Whoop are deranged. Whoop costs a lot more but it gives professional-level health analytics. Halo's analytics are sketchy at best and technically has problems counting heartbeats consistently when compared to a heart meter.Further, from a usability standpoint, I just noticed that week by week my points are dropping. I do the same exercise and increasing my calorie burn(stationary bike and rowing machine) for the same amount of time(12 min & 30 min) and the Halo weekly point count is dropping. What gives? Could it be that because the points are based on the time and percentage of heart rate, and since the more you exercise the lower your heart rate that Halo is calculating lower and lower points? Halo uses a fixed metric for an intense workout: 220-age is the max heart rate x 70%. So if you really want to move the Halo point counter you need to be intense. As you get healthier the harder it becomes to get to the intense heart number. This is very disheartening. Halo is punishing me for improving my health.I do like the body scan feature for fat analysis, which is unique to Halo as far as I can tell but is part of the iPhone app and really doesn't need the fitness band to work. If the 3d picture it takes of you doesn't motivate you to exercise, nothing will. Though, you only use this fat feature once every two weeks.  The sleep function is so-so and really only tells you how you are sleeping, but isn't helpful with a program to improve. It's kind of a ""so-what"".  Also, the voice sensor analysis is useless. I suppose it's another way for Amazon to get a microphone in your house, but as something I need, give me a break.Because of the heart rate and point count variability, I've asked Amazon to send me a new Halo to see if the one I have is defective. I'll update this if there is something new.",1
178,"I've been using Halo for a few months now, long enough to know what's working and what's not.What's working is that this is the only ultra-simple, no-display band on the market; even FitBit gave up on the less-is-more, no-display market, which is a shame. Like many who've gotten Halo, I don't WANT a watch face or display of any kind. I want a lowkey, non-distracting wearable that tracks my activity. Right now, Halo is the only practical tool on the market which does this.What isn't working is more nuanced:1. This is a simple device with no screen, yet it in terms of volume it takes up almost as much space as the smaller of the Apple Watches. The Halo is thicker than the product images make you believe it is. Why the hell is this thing so chunky?2. The band is not that comfortable. I've now had several wearables, all with more comfortable bands. The Halo's cloth band has a slightly ""sharp"" edge, while the fabric itself can tug on hair. The band feels cheap, more like a child's toy than a high-end piece of technology.3. The charger is a horrible piece of hardware. It's design is cringe-worthy. It's difficult to get the Halo to connect with the charger and, worse, there are times when the device lights red, meaning it's charging, and then later I discover that the device disconnected itself, meaning it didn't charge at all. Given the advances in induction charging and magnetization by other manufacturers, the stupidity of the Halo's ""clip"" charger is jaw-dropping.4. The biggest issue has been discussed by others, but it's mammoth: The app does not play nicely with other platforms. Apple Health? No, it won't report to Health. Your favorite dieting app? Nope. Any non-Amazon app whatsoever? Nope. The choice to barricade the Halo app from nearly every other app and platform out there is egomaniacal, unhelpful, and limiting.If only Halo had competition—any other lowkey wearable without a display, any no-display device which would track steps, heart rate, sleep, as well as things Halo doesn't track (like blood oxygen or ECG). If only there were wearables which had an even lower profile. If only there were such wearables which were more comfortable.Alas, there aren't any. Halo can exist only because there isn't anything competing with it, which is a shame. The market is wide open.",3

 I've had the band for 2 weeks now as part of the beta test group and just posting the initial review.The band does not have a screen and that's also a part of Amazon marketing. They feel this will cause fewer distractions while using the band. I've tested/compared the heart rate monitor analytic with a Movado Connect 2.0 to determine the variation and difference in BPM value (See attached video). the variation was 2 BPM Movado 72 BPM and Halo Band 70 BPM.As far as my phone operating system I have an iPhone Xs with the developer's version of iOS 14.3Cons:Halo App does not exchange analytic and data with Apple Health but you can download Health Data. You can also link your Halo App to John Hancock Vitality and Weight Watchers. This is a con because Apple health is linked to all major companies such as hospitals, veterans affairs, insurance, etc. which allows apple health to give a reference from your medical profile. I would like Amazon to link data with Apple health because it would be awesome if you can track your BPM, Sleep Study, Body Temperature, etc.There are no charts to show daily BPM like Apple Health or Google Fit. This would be important for a user to be able to see where their range in a specific period standConnecting the Halo Band was slightly default because Bluetooth would not pair or it would pair but the Halo App would not see the device. I recommend that you restart your device before connecting to the Halo Band so there is no prior Bluetooth interference.Sleep study has been accurate with Apple Health and it has been doing a good job detecting your sleep stages of Rem, Light, and Deep Sleep. In a later post ill provide all my findings.I will be testing this with Apple Watch & Fitbit in the coming future to check variation and tracking as well.  The band is a work in process and I'm still testing the usability and options available while using the band.IG: iamaris82",4
180,"This band is a FANTASTIC way to track fitness and sleep. For point of reference, I’m an active 30 year old male who’s working to lose weight. 6’2”, currently 228lbs, around 27% body fat.PROS:I love the fact that it doesn’t have a screen, as I enjoy wearing analog watches and feel a screen just adds too much to my wrists.The app is super user friendly, very smooth designs and easy to read data.The band is very comfortable, I was worried it would be scratchy but it isn’t. I wear this 24/7, during hard workouts and casual lounging, and it hasn’t bothered me whatsoever.The sleep tracking is really cool, really insightful to see how much of each level of sleep I get! This is harder to verify, without having some other advanced way to measure sleep. But seems pretty accurate so far.The body composition feature is awesome! While it can be disconcerting to see a full image of yourself, when was the last time you actually took a good look at your backside? Viewing yourself only from the front is common, and can give you a false sense of how your body looks.The battery life is good, lasts a good solid 4-5 days before giving the low battery alert.The subscription comes with several cool features, including the body composition, activity intensity, sleep stages and temperature changes, and full access to a bunch of articles on general fitness. $3.99/month is very reasonable. That’s less than a trip to 7/11 or a cup of coffee, let’s keep it real here. If you’re truly concerned with improving your health, this won’t be an issue.I haven’t used the voice pattern feature yet. Might in the future, if I do I’ll update this review.CONS:Really the only gripe I have with this device is the charger. It employs a clamp style charger that sandwiches your Halo band, with one side having several pins that meet the inside. Can be a pain in the ass to get the device to register that it’s on the charger, but once it does it only takes about an hour to fully charge, so that’s nice.Overall I say 5 out of 5 stars!",5
181,"Overall I do recommend it.The bad: This doesn't update activity or sleep unless connected to the internet, the sleep measurements don't show any naps even if over 2 hours like it says it's supposed to, the heart rate monitor is also very innacurate compared to others unless you keep it in the ""live"" mode, but that drains your battery rapidly for some reason. The app is also hard to navigate. Also, I knew it had no screen but having a watch band that doesn't give me the time of day is kind of off putting after a while. The tone detection drains battery too fast, isn't on enough, and depends entirely on how you read the paragraphs when setting it up.. so if you read it very animated, the tone check will indicate, ""low energy"" on almost everything you say beyond that.The good: The app has amazing videos if you can find them. The app manages your stuff in cool ways, just had to navigate at first. You learn how to do it quickly but I'm tech savvy and it was still frustrating.The best: The body scanner! Absolutely amazing feature!! Very very well done, I love it. I tried to trick it with typical model poses vs looking dopey, and eating chips/soda to bloat vs fasting, and the app remained very accurate even with huge water weight fluctuating over 10lbs. It's easily the most accurate body fat scanner for the average body far percentage people out there. Once you're below 7% you can't use it though!! (Almost everyone is above 7% so no worries there.) It's absolutely fantastic body fat scanner. Love it! It is behind a paywall though, so do note that.Also, it is lightweight and the bands look pretty cool. Very waterproof, clean feeling, doesn't leave moisture patches like other bands.I do recommend it for the app videos/motivation and the BF% scanner. If you'll use those, this is absolutely the best tracker. It's just not much of a tracker beyond that, since no GPS or HRV.. butttt, those features cost a lot lot more so you definitely get good value from this.In general, since I nap a lot, I found the sleep measurements too inaccurate for me to enjoy it because it makes me think I only get 4-5 hours of sleep a night when I really get 7-8 a day.",3
182,"I really wanted to like this device.  I bought this on early release and have been giving it a chance ever since, but I finally give up, especially since they've retired this model and are no longer invested in tone analysis.  My family has told me on several occasions that I have an overly aggressive tone in stressful situations.  I thought this would be a perfect device that made me more mindful of this.  Unfortunately, with the seemingly random times it picks up tone, it wasn't very helpful to look back at the day and see that I was ""frustrated"" 3 times between 7:30 am and 10:00 am in the morning, ""enthusiastic"" between 10:00 am and 11:30 am, and ""sad"" in the evening.  This does nothing for me as I can't pinpoint the exact conversations and events going on in those timeframes.  An in the moment tactile feedback device is more of what I was looking for.  This doesn't fit the bill.What it seemingly does well is track sleep, however.  I have been using it for that, as I use a CPAP machine at night, and I like to measure the effectiveness it has on my sleep.  Some nights it seems to work well as it will show I have multiple disturbances, and I wake up not feeling very rested.  Other nights, it is highly inaccurate and shows a period of hours where I'm supposedly awake, but I know I wasn't.The final straw was when my phone was damaged, and I continued to wear my Halo band, thinking I could just transfer my data and pair to my new device when it arrived.  Not the case.  Amazon wants me to factory reset my band, effectively losing the data I had wanted to track before I can pair it with a new device.  I feel suckered for having purchased this device and the membership for so long.  I'd much rather have an Oura ring for sleep tracking.  The hunt continues for something that will help with real time tone analysis.",2
183,"I was looking for a fitness tracker without a display. I use a mechanical watch and didn't want a smart watch because of all the distractions. This Halo Band is the best option I found without a display.It's really interesting that it tracks your voice so you can see how you sound to others, but I haven't found it useful past the first week, not to mention the enormous amount of battery drain the voice recognition uses. I usually leave it off nowadays to get better battery life.Other than that, it's your standard fitness tracker with health and lifestyle improvement suggestions and help in the app, which is cool.The only downside I think is that it doesn't integrate with Apple Health, so steps and calories burned, sleep data, it doesn’t sync, so your just stuck only using the Halo Band app (who’s isn’t a bad app at all).",4
184,"I've had the Amazon Halo since day one. 8 like how it looks and the style is minimalist which for me is a plus. Don't need an extra screen to look at. One distraction I don't need to worry about.Unfortunately the build quality is debatable since the sensor cover has fallen off and I have been putting this back and forth. I wish this wouldn't happen. And the fact that I have never put this under water is concerning for it to be to this point.I wanted to replace it, but the subscription is not justified. But that's as far as it goes. I like to use it as a bracelet, which doesn't replace my day to day wrist watch, but I'm always check if the sensor cover doesn't fall off.Sometimes it would be great to have different covers instead of being stuck with just one. I remember the Withings Pluse, but this Amazon Halo is not as bulky.Now getting into the tech it works! I can track my steps well and other body activities. Its good to know all is tracked, but the synching sometimes doesn't happen and this is with ny Bluetooth always on.The voice listen for tone is fantastic, but it can totally kill your battery drastically. Its a cool feature, but doesn't worth if your wrist band will die off rapidly. So I keep that off for the past 5 months.The body scan feature is fun, but after a while it gets kind stale. And its too much work to get your body weight/fat% and other health details.As an active person I tend to measure my weight, body mass, fat%, height, CO levels and Heart Rate and some results are not as accurate as I expected.Overall it works, but not sure if it worths the subscription and the fancy ""features"".If you are willing to subscribe to the Halo interface, be my guess. But after months on it I don't really feel I ""can't live without it"".There might be better trackers out there, but I do like the fact is minimalist and tracks all the vitals I want.Ready for Amazon Halo 2.0",3
185,"I have seen reviews going both ways on this thing, so I will give you my experience.  For me, I was looking for something that would accurately track my sleep, body fat % and workout intensity without having to charge it constantly.  Boom, when I saw this halo band I was all in.  I got the early access and received the band.  Yes, there is not screen and you have to use the app but that’s the point right? The app is simple, however, EXTREMELY informative.  When it rates my sleep as good, I feel a HUGE difference (ie well rested), then when it says fair or poor.  Honestly the sleep tracker performs better than I had expected. I like the body scans, but geez is it harsh compared to my scale that measures BF%.  Guess this could be turned into a good thing because it has me extremely motivated to push on my training now (which can also be seen in the app).  The biggest surprise for me was TONE.  I thought I was going to hate it and turn it off, but honestly the more data I gather, the more incredible this is at allowing one to become more positive and self aware.  I think back to some of these conversations that it logs (especially the negative ones) and reevaluate them.  It helps me think of a more positive approach to daily interactions and heck, that is a great thing in my mind.Overall - I’m two weeks in and I love this thing EXCEPT one design flaw (hence the 4 star) - Charging... It is a pain to “fight” with the band and charging clip to get it perfectly into the clip in order to effectively charge.  If Amazon/Halo team could design a better charger (heck get rid of the clip and have one you snap it or something), this thing is gold IMO... AS LONG AS YOU REMEMBER what it is you are purchasing (not a fit bit or Apple Watch etc.).",4
186,"I was gifted my Halo at the start of early access. I've worn it basically every day for over 2 months and I barely notice it on my wrist unless the band gets wet. I wear an apple watch on my left wrist, halo on my right. When I first got my apple watch I was very focused on watching my rings close or paying attention to notifications, so I like that there is no screen on the halo. I check the app usually in the mornings to see my sleep score and that's also when I review my activity from the day before. I don't have any issue wearing it every night when I'm sleeping, I think others might have the band on too tight. I appreciate that it gives me insight on the intensity of my activity rather than just a step count especially because I think MY step count is sometimes higher because it's on my dominant hand. I will say it was eye opening to see the amount of my daily sedentary time, even when I felt like I was pretty active during the day. I set up the body comp feature, I don't update the scan every 2 weeks like it reminds me. And no, you don't have to be naked or almost naked to do it. I wear a sports bra and workout shorts and it works just fine. Not any different than uploading progress pics to workout apps or social media pages. I don't have the Tone feature set up, but will probably try it in the future. But because of this I only have to charge my band like once a week, and I usually wait for the notification that the battery life is less than 20%. It takes no time at all to get to a full charge and it's pretty straight forward how to place the band on the charger. Overall a simple, reliable health tracker that offers what is stated on the product page. I wouldn't compare it to other trackers because it's just not the same as those.",4
187,"Does it work? I guess. Do I wish I could return it? Yes! I have basically gone back to using my phone as an activity tracker. When I start going back to the pool I may use it for tracking my swims.I only used the voice recognition for three days. It burned out my battery and said I was always annoyed and I definitely was not! At least not until IT started to annoy me, lol!The sleep tracker seems to work well. I do like checking in on that occasionally. It just verifies to me that I don't sleep very well which I already knew. I did try a few of the sleep activities and decided they just kept me from falling asleep until they were over and my quality of sleep didn't change either.Speaking of the activities, everytime I did a challenge I would complete each daily activity to the end and 9 times out of 10 it wouldn't give me credit for completing the task.Now to the most important part, the activity tracker. Does it actually track activity? I suppose. I really dislike that it only tracks steps taken and not distance. I hate that I can't touch a button to tell it I am starting and stopping an activity.  I also dislike that everything has to be viewed on your phone. I understand the theory behind it not distracting you by not having an electronic face but it distracts me much more having to get out my phone to see how long I've walked rather than just looking at my tracker to see the time. I hate even more that I have to use Google fit on my phone to track how far I've walked so I know when to turn around and head back!! I still wear it everyday. The battery life is still good. I like the color of my device. It is comfortable to wear but I would not buy it again and I would love to return it to get something better! I will definitely be cancelling my monthly plan when the free period expires.The body scanner is interesting. I'm not sure it's that accurate. I lost 10lbs and it said my body fat went up.",3
188,"I spent a very long time combing through the reviews before making this purchase. I moved forward and bought one and my biggest issue is just how unreliable and critical the *reviews* are. This Halo is GREAT. I can't believe I nearly listened to some of the naysayers. I think they may have never used technology before or are intimidated by the information. If you have the faintest idea about what a healthy lifestyle is, you're already on your fitness journey, and you don't want to look like a Spy Kid with a silly watch, buy the Halo.I am not a sedentary person - I work-out 7-10x a week (3x with a personal trainer) and am very focused on sleep and healthy eating. I thought I was performing optimally but until, I began using a tracker, I didn't have anything to back that theory up. My Halo is highly accurate - or, at least it matches nearly everything my trainer has told me or suggested. My body composition is dead-on with EquiFit at Equinox, which is highly reliable. Sometimes my calorie burn is lower than I'd have guessed, but maybe every other tracker just over calculated it (tbh I'd rather under-calculate than over-calculate!).Only issue I encountered was it failed to sync a few times when I first got it. I performed a full reset and have had no problems since. Since my data is in the cloud, my stats and scores remained intact even with a reset, which was a relief.It's comfortable. The fabric band is great - I went with rose gold/blush and then changed the band to olive green. Matches my workout shoes.It's not distracting at all. I sync it only when I think to check my app, then I quickly scroll through some info and make sure everything looks good.The weekly goal is my onnnnnly issue. Truly. The goal is for 150 activity points per week, beginning each Monday. I sometimes exceed 150 points in a single workout. I wish there was a way to edit this goal. Sure, the app gives you a higher goal once you hit 150 but the articles and videos tend to just focus on that silly 150 number. I think 900+ would be a good goal for me but that isn't something I can change in the app.Buy the Halo! This should be the most popular tech item and for reasons unknown, it's not.",5
189,"I was initially interested in the Halo band after learning about the Tone feature. As a woman in Corporate America, I am always aware of my tone at work but not so much at home, so I wanted to give it a try. Since March 2020, I've been working from home and have gotten increasingly more sedentary as time has passed. I purchased a treadmill desk to help but nothing did the trick. My Apple Watch was too easy to manipulate to make me feel like I was doing the work when, in reality, I was doing the bare minimum to close my rings.I received my band a week ago and I LOVE it. The activity tracking is exactly what I needed - it automatically picks up when I'm doing a workout and awards points accordingly. When I'm walking at my desk, I get a point every 20 mins. In three days, I was able to earn over 400 points and the app automatically adjusted my weekly goal to 600 to continue challenging me to get better.The only negative is the voice recognition - after setting it up, I realized I read it in my presentation voice and not my everyday talking tone which has me concerned that I won't get accurate readings. I'd like to reset the feature but I can't figure out how to do so.  Other than that, it is providing exactly what I'd hoped for and has made me much mroe aware of my tone with my loved ones and my colleagues.I highly recommend the Halo band for people focused on increasing all aspects of their fitness in a way that automatically customizes to your lifestyle and takes our own personal bias ou rof the mix. I can't wait to see my overall improvements in my health and overall wellness as I continue using the Halo band.",4
190,"Amazon Halo is nothing special. I was very excited to get this smart device after I saw the ad. I was thinking it would offer something new and different but in the end, it is very similar to all the other wearables out there. Let me explain.The tone analysis option is fun at first. I have found it pretty accurate despite the skeptical reviews I read. But honestly, where is the value? After a week of use, I deactivated it because it uses quite a lot of battery and I haven't really missed it since then.The body Fat option is pretty good. They say it is pretty accurate too (I cannot be for certain since I have never measured it before). A very good option for people who are trying to lose weight. My results seemed pretty reasonable (even though I wasn't happy with it lol, but that's on me).The activity tracking option is good but has flaws. It is not too difficult to meet the objective unlike I have read in some comments. But the only tracking I see on my app is ""WALK"" while I play tennis for an hour... I have to delete ""WALK"" and enter tennis manually... One of the good things is how they classify ""intense, moderate, light, and sedentary"" activities. Therefore, cleaning in the house will count as a ""light"" activity for example.The sleep tracking option is by far my favorite and looks very accurate. They track my sleep quality, light and deep sleep which is cool. However, according to the app, I have a ""good"" sleep every night (around 6h 45 mins) when I feel like I sleep very poorly (due to stress). Maybe they should allow a ""review"" option of your own sleep and build machine learning on that info to determine what is ""good"" sleep.The look of the band is good, it's discrete and not too big on the wrist. Overall, I'm slightly disappointed, I don't think I will pay for the subscription beyond the free 6 months. If I had kept the box, I would probably return it because I'm pretty sure it will end up in a drawer in a year or so.",3
191,"I like not having a screen and it seems to be pretty accurate counting steps.  Battery life is good.  My biggest complaint is if i am paying monthly for an amazon app, why cant i watch my workouts  on my TV.  Who wants to look at a phone screen and do yoga?  And yes, you can cast to a TV, but not my TV in my bedroom.  I want to do nighttime meditation, i have to hold my phone.  I have a fire TV stick, why cant i download and log in there?  not sure it is worth the monthly fee if you cant even use it on a tablet or computer... the other features, the free ones, work great and i like it better than my apple watch.",3
192,"Let's deal with two of the things advertised regarding Halo, tone and BMR.  Obviously, how you feel emotionally, may be reflected in your voice.  finding out whether you sound happy, sad, or angry is as easy as asking a trusted friend.  There is no need to have your words stored on Amazon's servers.  The same principle applies to pictures of you have no business on Amazon's servers.  This is especially true when there are a number of reasonably priced scales that produce accurate results.  Now, I know that Amazon says a bunch of things about your privacy, but output from Ring doorbell cameras has been voluntarily (not requiring a court order) to government agencies.  Ring is an Amazon company.  I have little faith in privacy policy statements.  If, you don't mind sharing your data, that's up to you.  Also, this device is marketed as a fitness tracker, not as a medical device, so HIPAA regulations don't apply.If you are looking for a compatible app that can use Halo's data, there currently are only two, Weight Watchers and John Hancock Vitality, both of which require membership.  The Halo app, itself, is okay, but seems to have been written for the convenience of its programmers, rather than those who will actually use it.Here we are in a pandemic, with a device that can detect your heart rate, and therefore should have the capability to provide SpO2 information, but doesn't.  It doesn't even alert you if your heart rate exceeds what is recommended for your age.  It has the capability to determine your skin temperature, which would be great to alert you if you are running a fever, but that feature is tied only to sleep statistics.  As to all those ""labs,"" they are just fluff added to the app that have nothing to do with monitoring your activity.  They can be found in a number of apps specifically for their individual purposes, or even a good book, or two.when my six months of ""membership"" are up, I'll kill the membership.  Halo does a decent job of monitoring heart rate, sleep, and steps.",3
193,"I was an early purchaser of the Halo back in the initial release in December. I loved the idea of having a tracker that isn't in your face with a screen all the time. The fabric band was a wonderful implementation and much needed for people with wrists that are on the hairier side of the fence. A slam dunk, I thought.Not quite.The sensor itself was extremely hard, I soon found out. Making it a pain in the wrist to wear at night. There goes sleep tracking---after all, it can't track when it's not being worn. Oh well, I didn't really buy it for that anyway.Regarding voice tracking... for me, it was a gimmick that I didn't care for. I don't need a device to analyze my own tone, I can hear myself just fine. I tried it out of curiosity and it didn't seem all that accurate---even worse if you are multi-lingual. Oh well, didn't buy it for that either.I bought it to be a solid fitness and activity tracker. I cared about heart rate monitoring, BMI tracking, and exercise encouragement. So how does it fair there? Really good actually. The heart rate monitor was top notch... when the sensor wasn't slipping off my wrist due to sweat... doh. Still, make it a bit tighter and that problem's dealt with. The BMI tracker was highly accurate, except BMI changes are very slow... so there's hardly a need to fire it up more than once every six weeks. And the activity monitor along with the point system was great too... except I had to go in and tell it what I did and when because it often made mistakes on start and stop time, giving me fewer points than I actually deserved.But, it was a relationship I was determined to make work. This was one of Amazon's first foray's into activity bands, surely they would only make it better and more accurate over time.And then it died on me. RIP. 8 months of use and it simply wouldn't turn on anymore. I called support, got a full refund including the 15% restocking fee credited back. Maybe I just got a dud, I'll just buy another one and start over, right?A week later, my wife's halo band that I bought for her in January also died, exhibiting the same symptoms as mine despite the fact that she used it far less than I did---got that fully refunded too.And that was that. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... fool me... can't get fooled again.For now, I'd say wait. From a company as huge as Amazon, I'm surprised that these issues weren't caught in their user testing and QC process.Maybe they'll get it right in the future. Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, I suppose.",2
194,"*Update*After seeing this review Amazon reached out and fixed the problem. Unfortunately by that time I had already purchased an Apple Watch. I still think this product has potential, but the Apple Watch integration with Apple health and other fitness/health apps is doing a much better job of helping me track my fitness right now. I really hope Amazon takes this product to the next level because wearable tech really makes health much easier to track and manage.*Original review below*I received my Amazon Halo in November 2020 and I was pretty excited to use this fitness band. The voice tracking was an especially helpful feature that I used to monitor my tone during Zoom calls, helping me stay positive and alert during meetings. The fitness and sleep tracking worked well enough and the app was easy to navigate.Unfortunately, despite a decent early experience, I can't recommend this product to anyone. The instrument panel cover popped off the watch one day after charging which was unfortunate, but I figured it would be an easy fix. I called Amazon expecting a replacement, but not only did they refuse the replace the device, but they only gave me the ability to return it after I agreed to pay a restocking fee. Because the price has gone up, even if they replaced it at my purchase price I would have needed to pay extra to replace the device. I wasn't even given that option. Amazon staff refused to replace the device even though the damage wasn't my fault and the product was still under warranty. I've have friends who have had similar issues with Apple Watches and Fitbit's who have been able to replace or repair their products easily. Amazon wasn't interested in even entertaining the idea. Because the Halo is relatively new defaults are likely and with Amazon customer service being unwilling to offer repairs or replacements I can't recommend that anyone buy this product. The features have a lot of promise, but Amazon's business practices make this a bad investment.",3
195,"I have tried several fitness trackers before Halo, and I must say I am impressed by this.1. I have a small wrist and was worried based on other reviews how it would fit and feel. I am pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it is and it is not invasive at all.  2. Button placement is great - I have the Samsung Galaxy active 2 and when I'm working out with weights the glove is always hitting the button. On the Halo the button goes to the back so that doesn't happen.3. I love, love, love the point system!!!! It gives me something to work for in a week so if I have an off day I have the opportunity to catch up the rest of the week.  I was kind of worries about this based on another reviewer inability to hit the target of 150.  I have not had that problem. If I stay consistent I will hit the 150 in the 1st 4 days of the week.4. Body scan - like another reviewer said be prepared for some hard truths about yourself. I knew I had went up in body fat percentage but was shocked to see the actual number and the actual scan.  Looking at your backside in the mirror does not give you the actual truth.  With the scan you can see everything plain as day and see what your problem areas are.5. Lack of a screen - at first it was a challenge to get used to not looking down at my wrist for time or text or calls. I am used to it now and I like.6. Tone scanning - meh... I'm not sure about this one... Apparently the only time of the day i sound happy is when I'm talking to my dog LOLOL!!! I turned it off.  I may use it at a later date but right now -not to interested.7. Mobile app- I feel like the app. It is easy to navigate and get the information I am looking for. I find it much easier and less confusing than the Samsung app that I have used for several years.Overall I would say that Amazon has a definite win on this one and I look forward to the updates they make.  If you are someone looking to get a true look at your fitness then this would be a perfect option for you.",5
196,"UPDATE: This band is totally crazy. Based on the most accurate calorie burn calculators, I burn about 1,800 calories per day unless I engage in some sort of strenuous activity. So here is what Halo calculated on two consecutive days where I did no exercise whatsoever.Day 1: 3,001 steps and 17 activity points with 16 minutes of moderate activity (walking the dog) and 3hr 29min of sedentary time. And for this it calculated I burned 1,413 calories.This calorie burn calculation seems realistic.Day 2: 6,602 steps and 8 activity points with 8 minutes of moderate activity (walking the dog) and 16hr 24min of sedentary time. And for this it calculated I burned a whopping 3,046 calories!This calorie burn calculation of crazy, insane, out-of-this-world inaccurate!!!!I mean, you don't need an algorithm to tell you there is no way I burned more than twice as many calories on day 2. And there is no way I could have burned that much more than my basal metabolic rate with 8 minutes of moderate activity and 16 hours of sitting on my butt.I am returning the band and reducing my rating from two stars to one star.Original review:If you can get over the creepiness of your fitness band eavesdropping on you, you can be treated with incredible ""insights"" like this:9:49:30pm You had one phrase that sounded anxious, uncomfortable or worried.9:49:38pm You had one phrase that sounded happy, delighted, or appreciative.9:59:28pm You had one phrase that sounded amused, friendly, or happy.9:59:59pm You had one phrase that sounded unconfident, sad, or discouraged.Every few seconds a different mood with no context. And that is if you were even talking at that time, I have lots of phantom moods reported when I wasn't even speaking, and that is after training the band to my voice. Worthless feature.But this isn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem is the dismal two-day battery life. I have fitness bands with color screens that can last for days or even weeks on a single charge. But this thing needs constant re-charging even though it has no display. I can't comprehend why the battery is so weak. And this is with a brand new band, after a year or two the rechargeable battery will noticeably degrade after all the recharge cycles (all rechargeable batteries degrade) and the battery life will get shorter and shorter.The app is also quite dismal. Very confusing and cluttered with data that is hard to make sense of. And then after a six month trial you have to pay a monthly fee for access to most of the features. Before long that fee will cost more than the band itself. The monthly fee is more than the cloud storage of many security cameras which require many gigabytes of transfer and storage. Why is Amazon charging so much to access these features which exist on the band and require minimal amounts of cloud storage/processing?The band tracks sleep and steps with reasonable accuracy - about the same as other bands that are considerably cheaper.This band doesn't excel in any area, requires a costly subscription, has some novel features which don't work well and suffers from horrible battery life. It's a weak copycat product from Amazon which is just a money grab. I can find no reason to recommend this or give it more than two stars. MUCH MUCH better alternatives out there at a fraction of the price and no subscription required. Halo Band is a long way off from being competitive.",1
197,"For whatever reason, I had a long term fascination with the Halo Band. Despite having to pay extra for a membership to unlock most of its unique features, I had always been interested in getting more health data from the Halo Band beyond what I was already getting from my Apple Watch. I also had an odd fascination with the form factor, almost as an accessory more than anything, as well as an interest in the body scanning functionality of the app, and strangely even the (potentially invasive) tone tracking.However, after picking one up during a small sale, I have not been very impressed. The quality of the hardware is decent, and the app overall is not bad, as one may expect from a product by Amazon. However, the band does not fit well in the charger for me. It's an interesting form factor, clipping the band into the charger, but it regularly does not sit correctly the first time. The first time, I left charging with a dead band and lost sleep data due to it not sitting quite right. It is hard to tell exactly where and when it is sitting correctly on the charger.When it is fully charged up, it is still particularly uncomfortable for me to wear. It feels like it gives constant pressure and tightness to my wrist, in stark contrast to my Apple Watch. I multiple times a day feel uncomfortable with the placement of my Band, and have to poke at it, reposition it, or otherwise play with it on my wrist, in juxtaposition to my Apple Watch which feels comfortable in the same place all day. I have noticed deeper marks and discoloration on my skin compared to my watch, but if I wear it any looser it sits less well, moving around, and I do not get sleep data.Regarding the sleep data, while it is super cool and interesting to me what sleep data the band is able to collect, it is very flaky for me. I have recently had several nights in a row where I have worn the band, perhaps uncomfortably snugly, yet not snug enough or not in the exact right position where I end up with no sleep data at all. Additionally, while the body scanning is pretty cool, ironically I noticed the band was picked up as part of the scan of my wrist -- it's almost like this feature would be better without the band on. I have also had a couple of crashes in the app when trying to open the body scan page.The app is very cool to me -- the ability to use your phone camera to scan your body fat and track your flexibility by watching you perform some exercises is very cool. Unfortunately, these cool features require a costly membership and a very uncomfortable band.",2
198,"*** UPDATE AT BOTTOM ***I have had this tracker for a few months now. I must say, it is a great thing to have to keep track of the basics, but also with tracking my tone of voice (since I have been told my tone can be a certain way sometimes by coworkers) and then it’s great to look at of how I sounded throughout the day and know who I was with that made me sound a particular way. If you want to know, I sometimes have a tone that “I’m always right”, or come off a little condescending. *shrugs* anyway, I tried out recently the BMI scanner, and you do not have to take these naked. It says you can wear minimal clothing which means underwear and a bra (for a girl) or you could wear form fitting shirt and shorts/pants. They just do not want you to wear baggy clothing as the BMI scanner will read your body shape wrong. Anyway, I was impressed and since I did a body scanner for Orangetheory Fitness before, this worked just as well as that and gave me a great insight. I do highly recommend this product. What I love most is the NO SCREEN feature because as another reviewer said, I too need some detachment from technology, meaning less screen viewing. If I want to look at the details, my phone is right there to see, and collects the data when I’m away from my phone, and then uploads when I’m by my phone again. It’s great!*** THE ONLY THING that I have to say about this, is when it needs charging. I have to charge mine every 2 days, and when I go to put it on the charge, it’s sometimes a hit or miss.. meaning, if the band doesn’t sit right in the charging station, the green light won’t go on saying it’s charged. That’s my only complaint.",4
199,"The Good:I like the band.  If you get it wet it seems to dry very quickly.  It is comfortable for me and I wear it on my dominant hand as I am used to wearing a watch on my other hand.  It took a week or so to get used to it, but it is fine.  Also, the band snaps off easily so you can change it quickly if you are into all the accessories....Sleep tracking is decent although not perfect.  There have been times I was awake (but very still) and the Halo recorded it as light sleep.Battery life is really good - I can go 3 to 4 days without a charge and it takes only about 30 minutes to fully recharge it.There is no screen.  This is a definite plus for me!!!!  I don't need another screen!The bad:The clip/clamp to recharge it is bulky and can be fickle.  There were times I thought it was clamped in but it wasn't and therefore not charged.  By bulky, the clip/clamp is huge = far bigger than the device!  It also takes 2 hands to use...not a big deal, but still rather clumsy.One function I really wish was for a vibrating alert to prompt standing or moving.  I had a Jawbone tracker years ago that had that function and I loved it!The mostly mediocreI have not used the voice part - not sure if I will as I feel somewhat silly having a computer tell me how to talk (or behave how some programmer designates how to talk....)I have not done the body shots yet - I will eventually.Not sure about the monthly subscription.  It is cheaper than Whoop but I really don't want another monthly fee draining my bank account.Bottom line:  if you want a decent fitness tracker, this little thing will be fine.  It seems well constructed and the app is easy to use and the battery life is very good.",3
200,"Got this because it was half off on prime day i believe. I've used quite a few of these over the years. The best one which was bought(by jawbone) and killed was body bugg. Fitbit is ok, Misfit is best value and apple watch is very nice .  But my apple watch was old and i didnt feel like replacing it.ProsEasy to wearBand it comes with is comfortableLong battery life (tone disabled)Easy to use for the most partThe body scans are interesting but not sure how usefull the info is since it can't really measure your muscle massConsThe sleep tracking is the worst ive ever used. If you have to get up for any reason once you fallen asleep it stops trackingThe app is too cluttered, not easy to use. Have to to go through far too many screens just to see your heart rate.The points for activity could be streamlined, personally would like to be able to see my steps and calories burned much easier. Again the screeen is cluttered and not easy to naviagate.They try to give you educational info but i wish they would put the information somewhere off the main screen. Too much going on.Getting it to connect can be a painPrice at 100 is too high for something that clearly needs to be updated and streamlinedPrice for bandssubscription....this is kind of the worst idea ever for a fitness band. For the life of me , why am i paying to use this after i already bought it?Overall they have a long way to go in with this thing. Fitbit is an overall better value and they have their app in a 100x better place .Update, was contacted by amazon customer care. Wanted honest feed back. So they care about the reviews and the feed back which is an excellent sign for the future. One thing i forgot to mention. There is no way to link to a calorie counting app like my fitness pal. They should look into that...being able to see your calorie in vs calorie out day to day is a big motivator for me.",2
201,"I purchased this through the early invite.  I primarily got it for the sleep tracker and voice.First month or so no problems.  Sleep was tracked appropriately and my voice was pretty even in all parts.  Now there are days it doesn't track my sleep at all.  Other days it says I was awake for like 3-5 hours in between sleeping.  Am I sitting up in bed possessed by something and not aware?  Paranormal things happening in my sleep?  Seems weird and probably not true.  I work nights so I sleep during the day.  On my days off I sometimes take a little nap at night but the bulk of my sleep is still during the day.  It only tracks the first sleep.  It quit tracking the 2nd.  So my sleep score is really low all the time or non existent.  So...it seems to track 2 sleep sessions when 2 are not occurring and only 1 when I actually sleep 2 different times.The voice tracker is off some days.  I intentionally try to sound happy and upbeat just for it but apparently I'm an angry soul.  I guess it's my lack of sleep per halo!Settling it in the charger has become more dificult also.  I used to be able to just pop it in there and let it clamp down and voila!  green light.  Now I have to wiggle it around a bit and it eventually connects.Do I find this uncomfortable?  For the first few days, yes.  Not unberable but I wasn't used to wearing anything on my wrist.  Now I don't even notice it.  I try not to get it wet but I have worn it in the shower a few times accidentally and it's fine.Do I recommend this?  Eh...probably not.  I do not use most of the other functions though so I'm not a really good judge of that.",3
202,"tldr: This could easily be a 4/5 or 5/5 product, but between the lack of labs and the charger issues, this is a 2/5 product.  Read on for details!Background: I’ve been using this for 5 weeks as part of early access. In the last six years I’ve tried early fitbit, microsoft band, and am on my 3rd apple watch. For HRM comparison I’ve been using garmin straps for ~15 years to date.I currently wear the halo on my right/dominant wrist, and an apple watch on my left wrist.  The supplied band is extremely comfortable and the halo is the first device I’ve ever worn that you simply forget about.  Not having a screen is a great feature point that helps the device ‘disappear.’What I am most pleased about is the accuracy of the sleep tracking.  Halo presents data to me that I truly believe.  Halo’s app also explains the various sleep stages and what you should be expecting better than any other app I’ve seen.The heart rate data graphs also line ups well against my garmin dual when on a concept2 or bicycle; this is better than my apple watch tends to do.  Average heart rate often differs if you’re comparing post-workout reports, but that is more so due to the way that halo isn’t exactly specific on when activaties start or stop – it is only ‘accurate’ to nearest minutes for start and end times.The body composition feature is entertaining to play with, but accuracy is still to be seen.  The only comparable that I have at the moment is the graph that halo generates vs what my withings scale & app displays.  It matches – so in a pass/fail sense we’re looking at a pass.When I originally signed up for halo, one thing I was looking forward to were the labs and workouts.  While they are nice, the selection has been limited and about half of the content is nothing you couldn’t read about and replicate off a website from memory.  Premium content from eg 8fit is nice, but again the selection is incredibly small and mostly not worth it if that’s what you primarily are concerned with paying the 6 month fee to receive.  Based on how things are, I’m eagerly waiting to see how apple handles their fitness subscription that will tie in with their watches.With all that said, Halo has one single flaw that could be its ultimate downfall: that is the design of the charger.  The charger is absolute rubbish.  It takes significant fiddling with to work each time.  This is a huge inconvenience offset only by the fact that you only have to charge once a week if you leave tone analysis off.  Turn on tone and you’re looking at fiddling every other day if not more.  I like the product, but this is simply something that needs attention and should not have been allowed to make it out of QC and testing.Pros: Accurate sleep tracking. Comfortable. Battery life with tone tracking disabled.Cons: Poor charger design. Battery life with tone tracking enabled.",2
203,"Charging has already been difficult and syncing challenging at times, but it's very frustrating that after one use in a shallow pool - far less than the advertised 50' - it stopped working. Can't figure out support so a waste of money.",3
204,"I've had my Halo band for a little over 6 months now, and initially loved it. It seemed pretty accurate compared to other trackers, and I like that it doesn't have a face so it isn't distracting and doesn't tempt me to check my progress every 47 seconds. The body scan and resulting body fat toggle seems a little wonky, but can be useful. I've never used the Tone feature, but the workouts and information provided have been pretty helpful. Almost 7 months in, and it still has a good battery life - I charge about once a week - and is still in good shape, but I don't wear it in the shower, doing dishes, or anywhere else where it would get wet.My complaint (and the reason for only 2 stars) is that I have no idea how accurate it really is or ever was because with the latest app update, I'm getting WAY more points for normal activities that shouldn't count at all!Walking downstairs and letting my dogs out into the yard now nets me 10 points of moderate activity. Doing laundry almost always results in another 8 or 10 points. Basic things that I do every day, and have been doing every day for years, are ""earning"" me points by being counted as ""activities"", but only show up as actual activities if it takes me 10+ minutes to do them. I'm also losing far fewer points for my waking sedentary time than before despite nothing changing about the amount of time I have to sit at my desk every day.These things never registered prior to the most recent app update, and I'm wondering if Amazon didn't cave to the people complaining that it was ""too hard"" and ""demotivating"" to earn points and avoid losing points for sitting too long. I was not a very active person when I got my Halo back in January, and the insight provided by it was eye opening to say the least. It really helped me to see just how much time I was spending sitting at my desk, and how little time I was spending actually taking care of myself. For the first month, I was lucky to earn 50 points a week, and I had to actually work out and avoid sitting for prolonged periods to actually earn them.My normal weekly point accumulation has been around 150 - the target number - for months now, and that's with actual work outs 3-4 times a week. But ever since the latest app update, I'm getting 150+ points by Tuesday night! Now I'm questioning if I was getting shorted before, or if I'm getting overcompensated now.If it's the app, hopefully this issue can be corrected. If it's just the band malfunctioning and no longer accurately tracking, then that's a real shame, because no matter how useful I find the information it provides to be, I won't shell out another $100 for a new band.",2
205,"So far I like the simplicity of the product. I think it does well tracking the day and my workouts. But I noticed that when I am driving for longer periods of time, my ""heart"" sky rockets to a point that is so far fetched, it can't be correct. I've attached three photos. A weekly summary of my days with workouts and showing Sunday with the additional 2 hour drive. The second picture is my heart rate during the drive and the third picture is my expected heart rate during a 50 minute row.  My phone connects to my apple play in the car so I'm really not sure where the app or my band is pulling this data.UPDATE: I've contacted Amazon customer service after several trips with the same issue. I decided to attach the HR monitoring from the Halo live and the apple watch and you can see there is a huge difference in the tracking. Even when the car is in park, the HR stays high. I don't think I can really trust the accurate calorie count or ""points"" when I have drives in my day.Other than that, I like the product and I like the app. I was addicted to the apple watch and hitting my daily active calories and my steps. With Halo, I feel like i have the points I mentally want to reach for the week and I am good when I hit them. I'm not stressing on ""rest"" days when my Apple watch would tell me I'm not doing enough.On another note, I do think that the body scan is pretty cool, but I've never been over 17% body fat and average around 13-15% using other devices, but with the scan, I am at 21%. I am a pretty ""big"" guy, but I have hips and a butt so I'm not sure how accurate the percentage truly is, but I use the photo more than the percent, so it works for me. Overall a great product, just need to get the heart rate thing figured out before someone thinks they are having a heart attack.",3
206,"I bought the Amazon Halo because I liked the idea of a more holistic approach to maintain my fitness routine.  Overall, I have been very happy with the product with only a couple of problems with it.The good:The band is very comfortable to wear.The sleep tracking is very accurate and gives me great insight into my sleep routine.The heart rate monitor has been pretty accurate as well and I like how I can check back in regards to my previous exercise or just go live to see my rate.The app is easy to set up and offers many exercise routines for all skill levels and different articles on physical, mental and emotional health.The not so good:There is no place to log food or water intake in app which is a major disappointment.The list of exercises to add is very short and doesn't include some basic choices.While the band is fine for very casual wear, it definitely is out of place for business wear and more formal wear.  I think it looks ugly with dresses for example.The overall activity number often seems dependent on arbitrary factors.  For example, new parents who get up during night to feed a baby is going to get a much lower score because the app detracts for poor sleep patterns.Overall, I think the Halo is a good product; most of the minuses come from the app which is definitely fixable.  I would also love to see a band fix that would allow for a more attractive and professional look rather than juvenile, fabric band that looks like it's out of the 80's.Even with the minuses, I'm still wearing my Halo and I'm glad I have it.  It definitely helps develop a healthier lifestyle.",4
207,"Love the design. It charges super easily, the strap size and comfort is perfect. Love how easy it is to work, handle and use. I love the unique velcro and it's super comfortable.#1 I wish it had a watch on it. Just a tiny little one.#2 I want it to record snoring and I don't believe that I get as good of sleep as it tells me. That might have to be worked on.#3 Sometimes it just decides not to record any voice tone on some days and I just get no data from that. I check the settings and make sure then mic is on and it still has recorded nothing. While it does take battery to record voice I think it should record more often. Also I would like to hear what it has recorded, what it was recording. That might prompt me to purposefully record at times when I know I will be speaking.#4 I love the body scanning. It was extremely accurate for me and I can't wait to see how it compares over time. I really like how it records activity and the activity intensity. That has been very accurate as well. The scoring points for activity is a pretty cool tool. It makes it simpler to reach a goal by the end of the week and it's a fairly reasonable goal too.Having a small watch on it would make it easier to choose between what to put on my wrist in the morning. The watch or the Halo. And I want to have to choose the Halo.  Maybe have it where a user can press the button and a small AMOLED display shows just the 4 time numbers on the device and not the band. The small spot on the side of the device opposite of the button would work great.",4
208,"I have been using the Halo for about 2 months.  I was using the Fitbit Versa for 2 years before I got the Halo and I had been looking into getting the Whoop product until they launched the Halo.  I was sold almost immediately because the price point is much more affordable compared to the Whoop, so it was worth buying to try it out.I actually really enjoy not having a distracting screen (although I do miss the clock).  I can focus on exercising and not looking at my screen for my HR, time, distance, etc multiple times.  It is also very honest about assigning points for the intensity of exercise you did, which has been helping me lean out much quicker.  For example, I went on a 2 hour light walk on a trail and it only gave me 8 points because my heart rate never got that high, whereas my Fitbit would have assigned about 300-400 calories of output.  I used to pat myself on the back with my Fitbit after that walk and think I was done working out for the day but now I push myself harder and jog the trail or walk longer or more frequently.  I am starting to lose weight again rather than plateauing!Downside is that the battery does have to charge every other day if you turn on the Tone function.  The microphone stays on the whole time while you have it on your wrist.  I have found this function more amusing than helpful.  It seems I am sad or grumpy when I am at work and happy and content when I am at home with my family.  Sounds about right.  The charger is mildly difficult - if you charge it with your band on, it takes a little finagling but it’s really not that big of a deal.",4
209,"Pretty cool tracker if you are interested in your health statistics without the bulkiness of a watch. Very lightweight - most of the time I do not even notice it on my wrist. Not at all cumbersome to sleep it. Sleep tracking is mostly accurate from what I can tell. Gives a lot of good information between the sleep tracking, activity tracking, tone analysis, and movement analysis (if that interests you). The only two knocks I have are that sometimes the app takes a little while to refresh with current, updated statistics and on occasion the band doesn't sync immediately. Obviously, neither of these warrant a return of the band as they take seconds usually to fix. Overall, cool device that gives ample insight into various health metrics.",4
210,"I'm late to the fitness tracking party - this is actually my first device. I got it to aid with the eating-better-weigh-less program Noom. One reason I really like Halo is because it gives me information about my sleep - which is sometimes a little lousy, and it shows up as lousy on the app, so that's validating.  One issue I don't like is that I often have to stay up until the wee hours to get work done (I'm a teacher), and when I do so, I get penalized in their point system for ""sedentary hours."" Those are hours I would otherwise be asleep, which is definitely a sedentary activity. I'm not quite sure how to resolve that issue - and the penalization for sedentary hours, I do understand. Loss of a point for each hour over 8 that you are sedentary should motivate you to get up and get moving. But I can't really do jumping jacks while I'm online teaching, and I can't walk up and down the stairs while grading papers. So - there are limits to it's helpfulness with this whole penalization thing.  It has made me more mindful of moving, so I guess that's the overall goal.  I have not used the Voice Recognition feature, though I might.  I have also not used the body scan feature. Maybe I will when I get closer to where I want to be, but for right now, I think it would just be a little to...""Damn, son."" Anyway, without any other experiences to compare it to, I like it so far. Seems accurate on the step counting, though I have found myself making laps around inside of the house multiple evenings trying to get steps in to meet my ever-increasing Noom step goal. I assume everyone that wears a fitness tracking thing does that.",4
211,I’ve been using this over a year and it tracks very well. The detailed data it collects on sleep is my favorite. It is more information than an Apple Watch. I just wish I could wear my Apple Watch AND have the date from the Halo tracker. The other features like the body composition and movement are very interesting to see after you record your status a few times for comparison. It helps with actually seeing your progress (or not) with images as well as the numbers. I would recommend this highly!,4
212,"I've been using the halo band for 6 months. I've seen tons of improvements in each update released. The major improvement had been the battery which last longer now plus syncing up with my calendar to measure tone during meetings.I use are tone, body scan, sleep tracker and activity tracker. I'm still on the trial membership period.Pros-The sleep tracking is pretty good, i have an oura ring and both devices are pretty align most nights. Honestly sometimes it feels like halo band is better than ours ring as the ring sometimes is lose. It has pretty good details about light, rem and deep sleep, plus it tracks your body temperature.-tone is a little freaky but pretty accurate i would say. I've noticed than since my baby was born my tone is more positive. The days that i don't get to see him much, it goes the other way which is totally right.-body scan are ok. They don't feel super accurate compare to callipers but much better than home scales with scanners. I hope it gets better over time.  It also has a model that shows how you would look at different fat percentage levels but again seems like it lacks work or training data.ConsThe major drawback is the lack of integration with other apps. Amazon halo only integrates with weight watchers and john hancock vitality. I wish it will share the data with other ecosystems like Google fit, withings or at least it bring data from other platforms into the halo app.ConclusionAt this point i don't think it's worth paying for the subscription. The labs aren't very exciting if you are a person who already exercise. Most of the labs are feel to be for people who like to do home workout s with some guidance.",4
213,"I don't know why this is missing HRV? I heard on a podcast recently from the Whoop CEO that Amazon was interested in buying Whoop a while ago, did Amazon not do HRV for fear of being sued or something? Even Apple Health tracks HRV.  It's not the craziest thing in the world to add, it's basically just measuring the difference between heart beats.-- I am deciding to return it after a few days once I had a chance to really exercise. I did a 20 minute elliptical with HIIT where I was always over 130 with bumps to 150-160 and this said I maxed out at 109. I wish I was that fit, but I know from multiple other sources that that's not even close to accurate unfortunately.It's a shame, I like the look with the domino sports band and I really want a fitness band with no screen that has good battery life, but I really want at least fairly accurate HR measuring and also HRV measuring.Maybe will get the next iteration of the band if it resolves these issues. I would really  prefer it since then I could also wear a normal watch.",2
214,"UPDATED: The sleep monitoring is more informative and accurate than Apple Watch or Fitbit.  Halo Band's time readings are spot-on night after night -- I know because I've been monitoring and comparing.  My brand new Apple Watch 6 (which I've been wearing on the opposite wrist) only tracks total time ""asleep,"" but never realizes when I get up and take the watch off to shower, shave, etc., and keeps counting me as asleep (apparently with no pulse and a body temp under 90 degrees!).  The two Fitbits I've had were better sleep trackers than the Apple Watch, but still not as precise as the Halo Band.  It blows my mind that the Halo Band tracks stages of sleep, too (REM, deep sleep and light sleep, along with the number of disturbances and even skin temp).  My experience with Fitbit made me skeptical this in-depth tracking worked as advertised, but Halo Band has convinced me.  When it says I got 1.5 hours of deep sleep, for example, I can totally feel the difference compared to nights when the tracker says I spent only 54 minutes in the stage of sleep.  Unlike competitors, Halo Band's sleep tracking really seems to work.The tone of voice monitoring works really well, too.  I sometimes use the live feature while I'm on calls and it seems to align well with how I'm actually feeling.  When I know my stuff and have good answers, it says my voice sounds confident, knowledgeable and helpful.  When I'm on a difficult call or am annoyed, it picks up on that, too.  That's the real benefit -- it lets me catch myself in real-time so I can pivot to a more constructive approach.The lack of a screen is actually a selling point for me.  I'm too easily distracted as it is.  The last thing I need is another device calling for my attention.  I just strap this thing on and go about my day.  Then I check in with the app when I really want to pay attention to it.  And because there's no face, it looks OK with an actual watch on my other wrist - like a bracelet.If you want a slick watch face, the Halo Band isn't for you.  But if you want sleep tracking and step counting with the added bonus of tone of voice feedback, this is the best device available.",5
215,"I LOVED this device at first! I even preferred wearing it to track over my Apple Watch. But then I noticed that after a while, the sleep tracking didn’t work as well as it previously did. It wouldn’t recognize I had gone to bed until sometimes 2 in the morning even if I had been asleep since 10. Then, the voice tracking began picking up other voices rather than my own. It was worse when I was working out, and it would track the instructor’s voice as mine so my summaries weren’t even accurate. Eventually, it just stopped tracking my tone altogether. I’m hoping as they keep working on the app & the product that they’ll get these issues resolved but until then, I’m done wearing the band.",3
216,"It's in an interesting tracker - that has a lot of good value but some major cons that constrain it. Previously I had a Garmin 235, so everything is compared against that.Pros:-Heart rate tracking seems accurate (compared against a chest strap), much better than 235-much smaller that allows me to sleep with it on (and is much more accurate for sleeping)- accurate for tracking workouts- like the fact that it's doesn't have a face, nice to not have to be distracted.- sleep tracking is awesome and one my favorite parts.- decent variety of fitness classes and labs to doMeh parts:- Tone stuff is interesting, but since it doesn't say what you were actually saying hard to tell what happened- body fat scanner seems like it gave a high result but maybe I'm actually that fat who knows (I also don't really care about the privacy aspect but everyone is different)The big cons:-no integration with outside apps or gps. I sync all my activities (peloton biking running) to strava and this exists in its own world.- can't export heart rate: If I peloton I can't use the heart from this on the bike to track effort during my ride, so I have to use another tracker.- the classes/labs seem cool if you get invested, but there is no halo app outside of mobile, I don't want to watch a class on my phone if I don't have to.Overall the biggest draw back is that I still have to keep my Garmin around to do specific activities or get data into strava. If you don't pay for fitness classes (i.e peloton) or have an advanced tracker (fitbit/apple watch), it's a great deal and gives a ton of good insights. Otherwise it seems like it doesn't cover enough of the major areas to be worth it.",4
217,"I thought this sounded really cool. I was curious about the voice feature since I'm a trash human who is trying to work on their tone. That was verified - I'm often perceived as angry, sad and condescending. No surprise there. It was nice to see that I'm usually very happy around my boyfriend but once again, it doesn't take a watch to tell me that.  I compared the steps, sleep and activity alongside my apple watch. I've also tried other fitness bands but so far nothing beats the apple watch with the features it has. The sleep tracking on halo is cool. It does REM, light and deep sleep. It appears I get more REM than the typical person which was interesting. But otherwise I have autosleep on my apple watch that does pretty much the same thing. Comparatively, they're very similar on sleep, activity and steps data.  As far as comfort, I found the halo on the verge of painful. It was too big and bulky and didn't feel comfortable at all. It didn't matter if I moved it closer to my wrist or a bit farther up so it didn't hit my wrist bone. The included band is also liable to get pretty grubby over time. Getting it wet is annoying because it takes too long to dry. I see this as just a way to upsell you to a better thirty buck silicone band.  Battery life is short with the voice feature on. I had to charge it every day, the same as my apple watch. I chose to return the halo. It sounds cool but just isn't all that necessary unless you want the paid extras like headspace and orange theory etc.",3
218,"The watch and app were really good and I enjoyed the unique premise for this type of fitness tracking. I enjoyed the simplicity of the watch and found the app to be very informative and helpful for my fitness journey since I wanted to focus on my overall health not just my physical health. However, after 3 months the adhesive on the glass connecting the HR tracker (part of the watch that touches the skin) came loose. I was unable to get the adhesive to attach the screen again, so I contacted Amazon because this product is supposed to be under warranty. Well not only did I have to speak to two Amazon reps that didn't even know this band was an Amazon product they also didn't offer me any solutions to fixing my problem One rep told me all I could do was return the watch, but I would have to pay a $20 restocking fee even though I didn't want to return the band I just wanted it fixed! The next rep asked me if I spoke to the watch's manufacturer to which I replied Amazon is the manufacturer smh. I was so unhappy with the lack of solutions to the problem (which was either accept a $15 credit or return the watch) that I went ahead and returned the broken watch for a refund.Update:A representative from the Amazon Halo department contacted me and was very sweet and understanding of my situation. For those reading my comment if you have issues with your Halo band and you speak to a representative be sure to inform them that the Amazon Halo bands have a department and they need to route you to their department. I was thankful for the representative's call and I now know that the warranty is real and the Amazon Halo department can assist you!!!",3
219,"I have had other watches that track all steps and show my messages and etc.  I decided to go with this faceless tracker instead because I didn't want something constantly distracting me.  It's comfortable (I have the fabric band) and I have cycled, lifted weights, swam, ran, installed fencing, washed dogs, done dishes, dug holes and everything else that is in my daily life.  It's held up phenomenally...until today.  A piece of fencing snatched it off my wrist.  Disappointing for sure.  I was able to tape the broken end back together and it will hold until I can order a new band.I find myself VERY motivated by it.  I walk a bit further just so I can reach my 10,000 steps, I push myself harder when training to see how high I can get my heart rate and still sustain the workout, I feel soooo accomplished when I see those points on the rise!I recently had a full body scan for my BMI and the scan through the app was right in line with that.  I'm excited to track my body changes on my own through the app.There is so much info and videos and recipes that I haven't explored completely yet.  I'm excited to though!",5
220,"UPDATE:I have a smart watch, polar chest strap, and this. Never really checked the accuracy against others. I assumed it was working. Then my chest strap stopped working so I started using this to track my live heart rate. It wasn't working. Seems to miss ten minutes off the beginning and sometimes off the end too. I got a replacement and it's doing the same thing. Can't count on this if you want anything remotely accurate (as far as when it starts registering activity - the accuracy of the band seems comparable to other wrist monitors when it actually starts registering).UPDATE2: Today I went to the gym and recorded it on video from the beginning. It took about 20 minutes before the halo reflected my actual heart rate. My heart rate was above 135 for a good 18 minutes before the Halo band rose above 90.I called Amazon and complained. To their credit, even after 5 months, they gave me my money back. But I have been using this since January and basically I can't trust that it's been even remotely close to reality in this whole time.P.S. The only time I checked the accuracy was when I was on a stair climber machine. For all I know, for actual running or other activity with stepping or vigorous movement, it might work fine. But the fact that the live display says that my heart rate is at 70-85 and my heart is actually around 135-150 for a full 20 minutes or makes me doubt everything about it. Why show my live heart rate if the number doesn't reflect reality?ORIGINAL:Sleep tracking doesn't seem to work for me. After 3 days, I can't find sleep on the app. Heart rate monitor seems accurate (compared to very accurate Polar chest strap). Other than accurate heart rate and longer battery life, I haven't gotten much out of it that my galaxy watch or gear fit 2 don't do better.[update: sleep tracking works now]Body fat seems cool though. It was almost EXACTLY what my eufy scale showed. But that only cost $20 and doesn't require setting up a studio (not really, but taking the photos does require a little effort). UPDATE: As I visibly packed on muscle, my scale did not change my body fat percentage but the halo app showed up to 4% lower than my scale.I wish I could modify maximum heart rate. My maximum heart rate is higher than the calculated 220-age formula. By that formula, my workout regime takes me 85-95% every time. That puts all my workouts in the ""intense"" zone. An hour workout gives me almost a full week's recommended 150 (I get about 140).I noticed one woman was complaining that the Halo was demotivational because it gave her so few points. As I have the opposite problem, I suspect the issue is with the band basing zones for intense and moderate workouts based on calculated maximum heart rate vs. actual. If that woman's maximum heart rate is unusually low, she'd get less points as her heart would beat slower than necessary to take her into ""intense zone"". Mine goes into intense when I go over 62% of my maximum rate which takes very little effort.UPDATE: I tried to go to my maximum heart rate and stopped at 184 while my heart rate was still rising because I was afraid I would trip. The halo never went above 169 (approx. what my max heart rate is supposed to be). My Samsung and polar chest strap kept measuring (yes, I had 3 monitors on). It's like it decided that anything above my calculated maximum must be wrong.",1
221,"The product overall is a nice idea. I wear it opposite wrist of my primary fitness watch. I like the points system, the sleep tracking, body scanner and low profile. The charging system is annoying and temperamental.  The step count is consistently off from my Garmin Fenix and Apple Watch 6 which I alternate between.  Watch is always primary hand and halo off hand.  I prefer the sleep tracking to either watch… it’s more comfortable and I like the sleep temp. I bought it for the body scanning and this remains probably the only reason I keep using it even though it requires a subscription. Good band, not great.",4
222,"This band has a lot going for it. Amazon has packed a lot into it for their first shot. I got it originally to help me work on my tone. I work with the public and have small children and know I can be harsh or sarcastic a lot. But according to the band, when it tracks, I'm ""sad"" or ""excited"" or ""neutral."" It doesn't record phrases and it doesn't tell you when it decides to record your voice so you don't know when you were any of these things, so you're unable to go back to analyze why you might have been any of these emotions. Now the band has decided not to record voice at all, even after two resets and resynching so it's a useless feature anyway.It's hard to earn their activity points for their weekly ""goal"" as well, which is frustrating. I was on a treadmill and only got 8 points but if I lifted weights (I manually entered activity) I received more. Getting high amounts of steps per day also doesn't earn many points, which is annoying as I chase the kids around all day which in itself is cardio.The app is ok just don't factory reset your phone. You'll lose all your data and it resets your band then says your number is already taken. It has some good applets for sleep and exercise to help you along. The bmi thing is creepy and I'm not sure how accurate it really is. I lost weight and it said my fat percentage went up which was depressing and discouraged me on doing it again.Overall as a basic fitness band it does the job. For the extras like voice, it still needs work. If you're one that needs a screen this band is obviously not for you. I don't care about screens as I wear a watch too so that aspect didn't bother me and was actually nice not having that distraction.",3
223,"So I had the Halo from the early release.  It was a good ENTRY LEVEL fitness band...  I am very happy with the fitness features of my Apple Watch.  I like seeing my calories, activity, and stand hours as opposed to a point system...  I also like having a screen more than I realized.  I don't like having to go into my phone to check on my activity...That being said, I really did like the Body Imaging feature.  I thought that was great.  I wish I liked the band more just for that feature alone.I am not one of those people who loves having to go to my phone for other activities which is what this band and the subscription will really provide its users.  So I am a little biased as I am used to and really like having a screen on my Apple Watch and the features it provides.ONE BIG FLAW of the Halo.  The main reason I returned it was due to the charging clip.  It was really low quality and the light stopped showing if the band was charging.  I would mess around with it for.a while just to make sure it was charging.  Not the best feature...***For people looking for ENTRY LEVEO fitness band features, the Halo is going to be great for you.***For people looking for EXTRA FEATURES like other labs that will help you get fit and try new things if you aren't already into fitness, this band is going to be great for you.***If you already have an Apple Watch or another watch/fitness band combo and are comfortable with your fitness routine, this isn't going to do much for you...***If you are looking at a WHOOP fitness band, this is a GREAT Alternative!!!Overall, its an OK product, but I would have expected something better coming from Amazon considering how late to the game they are with a fitness band.  They are coming in at the end of the pack.",3
224,"I have used this device for about a month and it has never accurately been able to measure my pulse during non-running workouts. I am wearing it correctly per the instructions and have checked it against my chest strap HRM, my Apple watch, and my finger pulse oximeter. All three matchup but the Halo rarely does. It is typically 30 to 100 BPM lower for over 90% of my workout. I have tried moving it up and down my wrist. I have tried switching hands. I have taken it on and off. I have checked that the sensor was clean. I have waited for updates. Nothing has changed.Yesterday I was doing a HARD home cardio HIT workout (jumping squats, squat jacks, tires, etc.). I was not clenching my fists. I had the ""Live"" tab open the whole time. For most of my workout, my pulse on Halo live was 30-90 BPM lower than my Apple watch and my finger pulse oximeter. My pulse oximeter and Apple watch were the same, regardless of which finger I used. The highest reading on my Halo was 158 and that was briefly- typically it was in the 90-120 range. I have attached photos of my Halo and Apple watch readings taken within 15 secs of each other (Halo first) during that workout.  The Halo reads 81 BPM and the Apple Watch reads 170 BPM. I confirmed with the pulse oximeter- it matched the Apple Watch. I expect some deviation between devices, but the Halo was reading a leisurely walk and my Apple Watch and my pulse oximeter were reading what was actually happening, a VERY hard workout. This is consistent with what I have seen with all my ""at home"" workouts- the Halo is biased very low. I get more points with a leisurely walk to the post office than a hour long ""flop sweat"" workout.I purchased this product to use instead of my Apple Watch during to workouts that could break the screen on my or my Apple watch is annoying to wear (sailing, team sports, etc.). I was really excited to use it 24 hours a day and take a break from the constant buzzing of my Apple watch.  The Halo is too inaccurate to be useful. This seems to be consistent with other reviews.I requested a replacement in case my watch was faulty, but they are only doing returns. I will be returning my watch. It has no value to me if it is not accurate. I hope Amazon comes up with a more accurate band- I will miss it's ""low key"" presence.The body fat scans are interesting. It doesn't match any other methods I have tried, but it nice to see relative changes over time.  It would be nice if it used my phone's LIDAR. I would consider paying a minimal monthly fee for that service.""Sleep"" was accurate enough and consistent with my Apple watch. That is why I gave the Halo two stars instead of one. I did not try the ""tone"" feature. I wanted the long battery life.",2
225,"Update 10/29/21: Using a second Halo and a backup phone I determined the ""unpair when toggle Bluetooth off / on"" problem was because of bit rot in my phone. After firmware reset the Halo device didn't unpair after toggling Bluetooth off / on.It still doesn't remember my previous details though when pairing the Halo with the app.Update: Wrt to the un-pairing issue Halo support thinks I have a malfunctioning device and is sending me a replacement.Original review:This review and rating is solely about the Bluetooth pairing.Unlike every other Bluetooth device I've had I'd had this device will un-pair at the drop of a hat. Toggle Bluetooth off / on (e.g. airplane mode) it un-pairs. Run out of charge and it'll un-pair.Following the onscreen instructions to re-pair you will lose any unsynced data so make your charged up and paired before that workout!Re-pairing requires reentering setup data (name, height, weight, gender). If only Amazon had a cloud service which could store that data in the cloud...You will need the charging unit to complete pairing so make sure you carry that wherever you go in case you need to re-pair on the fly!It's clear the Halo team either doesn't actually use Halo or they love living with these impressively awful pairing problems.I suppose it's a nice device but it seems I've traded my Fitbit Charge 3 black screen of death for Halo's love-hate relationship with my phone's Bluetooth.I'm gobsmacked Amazon would release a product with this level of dysfunction.",4
226,"Got the Halo band around 2 weeks ago.The good:- Motivates me to move.- I like the way it values TIME spent in higher heart rate zones. (Rather than calculating how many calories I burned based on what activity I was doing, like some other trackers/apps I've tried.)- the Discover tab has lots of cool challenges and programs to try- it takes many factors into account (sleep, mood, body fat percentage) to give you a more complete overview of your health. Also it counts steps AND heart rate.- the app is clean and simple, easy to use- the charge holds for over a week- it's waterproof, so I can swim with itThe bad:- first and foremost, I had to wait a week for it to be shipped, and again when I ordered another Halo for a family member. Hello, you're Amazon. You can figure out how to get it to me in 2-3 days.- although it's not uncomfortable, it is a bit bulky, especially for sleeping- the fabric band stays wet for a long time. I don't like that I had to pay another 25 bucks just to have a waterproof band. I wish you could choose your band (fabric/silicone) when you order it.- although heart rate is a good measure of your activity level, it's not foolproof. Halo puts me in moderate heart rate every time I drive (funny, I don't mind driving, not sure why my HR goes up then) so on several 4-hr trips I racked up points, even though I was barely moving.- I WISH IT HAD A WATCH! I don't need a screen with info, but once I'm wearing a bulky activity band, I'd love to be able to peek at it and see the time. I do not enjoy needing to wear a watch on my other wrist.",3
227,"IT COMES WITH A CHARGER. At the time the description kind of made it sound like it didn’t come with one . So I bought one. Which has yet to arrive.Also. DONT think it has a screen . Look at the pics and read the description carefully.I knew I didn’t have a screen and I was fine with that .It’s okay .I was really looking forward to the tone/voice determination of this device . Honestly , the ONLY reason I got it . So when I received it and used it. I was pretty disappointed with that feature. I was thinking it would vibrate or beep differently for every time I sounded “sad, mad, confused, etc”. But it just tells you times you may have sounded sad, mad, etc. I don’t remember what I say after a minute . So I definitely won’t know after the end of the day.I do like the sleep feature of it. No really reason really. I just think it’s interesting. Not sure how accurate it is. When it comes to determining a person’s deep sleep, light sleep ,etc.The bmi is pretty neat too and accurate. I’ve only used it once so far, but Being in the army we are always meauesung our body fat by taping ourselves. So that’s accurate from that to the halo .The steps portion ..I can’t really say too much about it on how it is with the accuracy of tracking steps and points given.I’m gonna be honest .. I’ve only worn this like 2 or 3 times during the day and stopped because the device is too bulky, and it can get uncomfortable on the wrist and I already have an Apple Watch , so I just look kind of stupid with two things on each wrist.. So I only really wear I it to sleep for the sleeping feature .Also I should have gotten black cuz the pink gets so dirty fast :/ that’s my fault though,I most likely won’t be doing the subscription in the future.",3
228,"I was very happy - initially - with my purchase.  I paid for the monthly subscription for the added benefits of voice and scanning, amongst other options.I really liked the ability to ""scan"" my body and track my weight loss.  I wish that the app had options to do diet tracking as well, to reduce my having to use one app for meal intake logs and another app for my body.The activity tracker is very accurate and saves me from having to use my phone to track my activity.  I do like it and feel that it is very helpful.I love the sleep tracker, it has helped me to adjust my sleeping habits to get a better and more restful sleep each night, and I can physically tell the difference as a result.The voice recognition - worthless.  Less than worthless.  I have to constantly reprogramme my voice to the app and if I am lucky, it will work for the rest of the day.  The only upside of this feature is it does work if I open the app and do a live analysis.  But even pressing to record a conversation - nope.  It's all dependent on whether or not it remembers my voice.  (Funny side note, when talking to my adult daughter, it tracks her voice instead of mine.)I love that the band is washable and after three months the device itself still holds a solid charge to get me through the day.I cannot say that the subscription is worth it though after three months now and I find myself only putting it on when I am exercising or going to bed.",3
229,"It's a decent tracker overall but you can't track a workout like other bands.  The button on it is only for connecting to your phone or tracking you voice.  The voice thing is a useless feature for me and seems to be the main thing they are trying to use to differentiate the product.You can't start and stop a workout.  It just guesses what your activities were, so if you are doing something like interval training, it actually breaks it down into random different activities instead of 1 large one.  So if you want to see how each interval compare, you have to look at multiple activities compare but memorizing them for a minutes or two.  It really bothers me.The sleep tracking is decent, the time to fall asleep and temperature changes are helpful.  Doesn't give as many metrics as a Whoop or Apple Watch though.The app is decent, no complaints there.The body analysis is interesting but won't use it very often.  It's a cheap way to get fat % and things like that.The fitness scoring of intensity is pretty good to evaluate effort but isn't at Whoop levels.Overall, decent considering the monthly spend.  I'll stick with for a few months at least post the 6 month trial period.  I'd be more likely if I could track a workout and it gave some better sleep metrics.  I would even pay a slightly higher premium for more advanced metrics compared to these standard ones.updateAfter about 9 month, the battery won't charge above 30% anymore.  I have to charge 2-3 times a week now.",4
230,"My initial impression was really good, but after wearing it I found that it wasn’t very comfortable and the raised top part caught on things frequently. I think the app overall was the most disappointing. Having to actively open an app to get any data at all ended up being kind of inconvenient, watching and waiting for my band to sync each time. It’s not like the data was ready for me. I tried a few of the programs thinking “oh this might help me remember to drink water or stretch regularly” but all there is to remind you is a phone alert. Which also....fine. But I don’t have my phone with me all day and simple notifications get buried quickly. Since the band doesn’t vibrate or do anything to alert you itself it was easy to forget about it, the app and whatever it was trying to get me to do easily. The tone portion was disappointing because I thought it would at least let me hear what it had heard and analyzed for key moments but, believe it or not, looking at your phone and being told you apparently said some random phrase for 1.7 seconds that sounds “annoyed, stressed, or sad” isn’t very helpful because if I can’t hear what the band heard and then get to reflect on the tone......how do I know WHAT I need to improve. It not conducive to just pretend like you’re talking to a puppy all day to try to have happier, more energetic tone readings. So this feedback from the band is lacking. The body fat portion was interesting at first, but I completely lost any faith in it or motivation when I took a third scan (exact position/clothing as previous scans) after having lost a few pounds and it told me my body fat percent went UP 5%. Overall, this tracker seems to offer a sleek sales pitch and peppy imagery, but doesn’t deliver a useful experience.",3
231,"Was pretty solid for the 6-7 months it was working, but stopped taking charge within the past couple weeks. Tried multiple charging clips, tried cleaning, etc. -- nothing. My return window ended a long time ago and my support window ended 15 days ago, so I will now need to throw away this $100 device. Unfortunate.Also, the heart rate readings were never accurate during workouts for me, no matter how many different ways I tried to wear the band (tried reinstalling the app, tried restarting my phone, tried re-adding the band in the app -- nothing). During workouts, the heart rate readings never got above 130 and usually hovered around 120, even when both my Apple Watch and Oura Ring were agreeing that my heart rate was more like 150-170. This unacceptably bad accuracy led to the Halo Band reporting that I was only getting moderate exercise when it was obvious to myself, my Apple Watch, and my Oura Ring that I was getting intense exercise. If I hadn't had these other devices, I would have gotten discouraged from never being able to achieve ""intense workouts"", and I likely would have stopped with my exercise plan.Since then, I have chosen not to rely on the accuracy of any of the data coming out of the Halo Band, as it has proven that it will confidently spit out wildly inaccurate numbers. Since then, I've only used it for its Live Tone feature to have fun with friends -- that's it.TL;DR: If you're looking for a wearable with reliable accuracy, I would implore you to pass on the Halo Band. If you're just looking to have some fun and try out new tech, then the Halo Band could definitely be interesting, provided you're willing to spend $100 on something that will likely stop working within the next year.",3
232,"been using it for awhile now and loving it. the app so incredibly user friendly and informative unlike many other fitness monitoring apps. I needed something without a screen , as there are already too many screens in my life. 10/10 would recommend !",5
233,I'm gonna write this talking about the pros and the cons yep I have bothSo one of the pros is the amount of information that this does provide probably one of the best products out there tell you the amount of steps heart rate body weight and one of my best features is the listening to your tonality it tells you what others are hearing I am a manager at work so this helps me in so many different ways and I always use this feature so let's talk cons and that would be why I gave it 3 stars not 5 so one of the pet peeves I have is the battery life it will literally last 50 percent of your day so I take it to work 8 hours in and it's about to die I would like to use this work out in and possibly walk my baby around in (I have a new born) so the other pet peeve is the battery charger and this actually is a no brainier for me why can't it have a type c or just a simple charger every time I mean every time I have to charge it I have to Aline it to match the the spot it goes in and this by far is so so upsetting cause if I am on the go I literally have to put in in take it out put it back move it around and wiggle it then maybe just maybe it'll connect should be simple plug it in and forget it ....non the less this product is by far one of the best I've had and I've had them all so would I recommend it yes and no for the price range and what's out there maybe but overall would I buy it again yes I would just like to see this charger change for future upgrades that Amazon will do,3
234,"Recently the back face plate of my device simply fell off during removal from my wrist.  I snapped it back into place, but a small strip of what I can only assume was the adhesive seal fell out along with the back plate.  Since then, the device has failed to record some parts of my day, on occasion.  Most importantly, I woke this morning, green light on, device charged to 47%, however no slee details.  Sleep is the number one reason I purchased this device.  Turns out it stopped recording data early yesterday and had not recorded any of my sleep data, workout or activity since yesterday morning.  This is so frustrating.  I do not wear this device in water, I wear it daily with little wear and tear to the device itself.  Since the pandemic started I barely leave the house.  I was pleasantly surprised by the item and appreciated the sleep tracker, though some frustrations regarding recording of data.  Will touch on that later in the review.  This is probably the least wear and tear an Amazon halo has ever seen and yet it just fell to pieces.  one frustration over the past year has not been with the unit itself, but the band.  Velcro frays and becomes less grippy, it’s absurd the price of replacement bands.  But now, I may not be able to use the device at all.  It seems to be falling apart.  I did not expect to replace this unit every year or two.  time to look into an Apple Watch or Fitbit!As far as the sleep tracking, the device does a decent job.  There have been a few frustrations.  I have had insomnia since a young age and would often wake for hours in the middle of the night. Unfortunately, if I was awake for too long the app would stop recording sleep data.  I’d be awake from 3am-5am and fall asleep for 2-3 more hours without any data recorded.  It was frustrating, because I was hoping to gather information on the quality of sleep after the wake episode.  I would literally be laying, sometimes for hours, listening to meditations, etc, in an attempt to fall back asleep and the device recorded none of it as rest or sleep.  This information would be really helpful to those of us attempting to understand our sleep patterns and disturbances.  Beyond that, I would love it to record data during naps.Overall, not a bad device, but the lack of longevity is a big concern.",2
235,"The insights provided by this device and app have been great for me. I toss and turn a lot so the time to fall asleep is waaaay off but otherwise I like the sleep tracking. The mobility testing and subsequent recommended workouts is awesome. Love the body scan, Ive done a DEXA before at a gym and this is pretty similar. The tone analysis is interesting, it doesnt keep a record of your convo so its a bit of a struggle to try and remember what I was talking about at such and such time but its still cool. I need to remember to use the live feature more.The thing I was most interested in and found the least info on when researching was the labs. I liked the idea of all the different companies they source and wanted to see how it went compared to needing subscriptions to a bunch of stuff. Im very happy with the labs. Ive done meditations, exercises, gratitude, even liked the recipes! No life stories just ingredients, directions, and nutritional info. They support a ton of diet types with recipes and guidance.Most of all though I love the activity score. Ive had an apple watch in the past and the rings were kind of cool. Full disclosure it was like a 2nd version so they do a tone more now and maybe apple health is as cool no idea. In any case at first I worried I wouldn't be able to reach the heart healthy score of 150 and would be demotivated. Im very sedentary and obese. I don't always reach it but between some walks and house cleaning its very attainable and Ive even hit the active goal of 300 some weeks. Helps me keep my health in mind at any rate.The only real con I can think of is I hate the way the green light flashes in the dark, have to shove my hand under my pillow or blanket.",5
236,"Overall I don't like it.  Here are my complaints:1.  When I first bought it, the 3d image of the body seemed pretty cool...until I came to understand the 3d image came about by simply taking a picture of yourself.  This was kind of the main reason I bought.  Turned out to be a huge disappointment.2.  I felt like I overpayed for it even when I bought it before it was previously available to the masses.  I believe I payed 60 dollars for it and it seems to not do anything.  I quickly lost interest in it.  Probably because it doesn't have a screen and only does one thing....see how good you are at exercising.  There is of course nothing wrong with that, and it will certainly fill a void that some people want filled.  For me who is already wearing a watch (one with a screen that doesnt numerous things) that counts steps and heart beat.....I just have no need for this device.  I guess the problem is that it is tied to a phone, which means that is the only way of figuring out the data that this thing holds.3.  Battery life for me is horrible.  I get less that 3 days from it.  And I use no features of it.  For those that truly use the features I would say expect 1 to 1 1/2 days from it.  The charger is no good.  Takes me a few seconds to get it connected and then a few more seconds to see if its charging.4.  Call me crazy but I wonder if this thing caused me to tear my Distal Bicep Tendon.  The way you have to wear it, it seems to me to put a pressure on your arm in a very weird way.  But anyway I tore my Distal Bicep Tendon while wearing it.  I was simply lifting a very very light box into the back of a truck bed and felt a pop....and the damage was done.I will not compare this to a device that has a screen as I would think that this would be an unfair comparison.  You buy it simply for a fitness tracker.  The voice feature is neat little concept, but again I think I used it once and that was it.  There just isn't enough with this little gadget that would make me pay for a monthly subscription to it.  They will get me for the first month but then I will learn to be sure to turn off the recurring fees for the months after that.  It there wouldn't be the monthly fees I would think paying the 60 dollars would be ok.  But paying monthly fees AND paying 60 dollars.....it is simply way over priced and not worth it.  In my opinion this device is certainly not worth the 100 dollars they are wanting from it.  That's highway robbery and way way way overpriced.",2
237,Battery life doesn’t last very long,4
238,"Not sure what all the complaints are, it does exactly what it says. I admit that I do not use the tone feature, cause well, honestly, I don’t care; all other features work great!Device is easy to charge and charges very quickly! Only need to charge 1 to 2 times a week, and takes less then an hourI would say the device is more for someone new to health and fitness. I wish I could change the settings on the goal points. I do bootcamp/HIIT style classes 4-5 days a week and run 1-2 days. I've always reached the 150 points by 06:00 on Tuesday!! Makes it kind of goofy if you are very athletic.I have a love hate relationship with the no face - there are times I want to know my heart rate without having to go into an app. I will say it does do a better job of reading my heart rate then my Garmin Vivoactive 4, especially on erg machines like the bike or rower.I bought this for the body scan feature, which I am very impressed with. Works great and I find it to be accurate. If you are trying to lose weight, this is a great feature and having the photos for comparison extremely helpful. I do the scans in a sports bra and underwear.Still in my 6 months free, not sure if I'll continue with the $4/month price tag. I find that to be ridiculous. I have owned Garmin fitness watches and never been required to pay to use their app. If Amazon wants to stay in the game, I really think they will need to drop that!",4
239,"I stand by my feature and functionality review from earlier, but the hardware quality may be questionable.  After 6 months the finish on the hardware is rubbing away.  I don't wear it when swimming or showering, so I can only assume that this is the result of rubbing becoming sweaty and rubbing on my shirts.  I'll update things again in another 3 months.If you are a beginner or serious about fitness, then this is the device for you.  It is very similar to another device out there (whoop), but the information is better organized and not as cryptic.  It tracks both calories expended as well as having its own fitness metric.  The calories are nice to see if you are also tracking your intake and want to compare the two, but the ""points"" tracker is a better motivator.  The sleep information is accurate and tells me a lot about how well the nightly recovery went.  I like the breakdown of the weekly activity and the fact that sedentary activity results in negative points.  Another great motivator.  The body scan feature is not as creepy as some would have you believe and although I haven't checked the accuracy, it certainly gives you good body composition numbers for tracking long-term progress toward your fitness goals.  The live heart rate monitor is nice for tracking those cooldown minutes.  I don't use the ""Tone"" feature and I don't use many of the included classes, but the few I have tried are good quality.  It would be nice to have integration with nutrition apps so that it tracked calorie deficits, etc., but I can make the comparison easily enough between apps on my own.",4
240,"I actually really love this band. It's exactly what I wanted. I have a Samsung watch that's perfect for a smartwatch but it definitely under reports my steps and activity and that was kind of bothering me so I wanted a dedicated tracker. I also have a Fitbit but it over reports my steps by quite a lot so that wasn't working for me either. I love that this band is just a tracker and not a watch because I would look pretty silly with a watch on each arm, which I did do when testing out the Fitbit by the way. The steps seem fairly accurate as does the heart rate. The body analysis was sobering for sure but I believe it's absolutely accurate because it's what other measurement tools tell me as well. The app itself I think is pretty great. It actually does encourage me to sit less if I can and it identifies your sedentary time how much sedentary time you have left. It tracks my sleep pretty well I like that it identifies how long it took me to fall asleep that was interesting to see. I also like all of the helpful health information that it provides. Well I guess I can understand some of the complaints I think this tracker is phenomenal and I'm really really glad I bought it.",5
241,"I have tried consumer body fat measurement options and find this app the most promising.  It most closely corresponds with pictures online of other individuals at a similar body fat percentage.  I also like the body photo journaling, but It should be password protected.I saw some reviews online (off this website) by some who share my weightlifting interests.  Their critique was that they are very lean (10%) and the app said they were 20% or more.  They included their pictures and it was clear they were not even close to 10%, so take those Body criticisms with a grain of salt.The sleep feature is useful and the rating is interesting but does not seem much different than other tracker options.  The device is small and so sleeping with it on did not bother me.Tone is a first-beta-quality gimmick at this point.  It said I seemed shy talking to my own kids, among other things.  All the features are software based so there is room for improvement.The 6 months of included service is good, but what is currently offered does not justify the price that will be charged after the introductory period ends.  It may seem small, but it actually increases total cost of ownership to the level of an Apple Watch over a few years, which is a vastly superior product.My conclusion is that people who want to track body composition and sleep will enjoy this product as an extra device if they already have a smart watch or Fitbit.  For the average person the Apple Watch or Fitbit is a much better product if they have to choose one, and I will only use this product to supplement my Watch.If your weight does not vary much and you are happy with your body composition, I do not think you want to buy this at this time.  The other features are not worth the cost, particularly with the subscription.",3
242,"I've been looking for a minimalist heart rate monitor for my wrist, and the Amazon Halo checked all the boxes. It looks good, it wears light (I often forget I'm wearing it), its battery lasts for a good amount of time, and of course it does its job. I don't use the Tone functionality, and I don't wear my band 24/7, so I have yet to find myself in a situation where I'm out of battery, but it also charges remarkably fast. For example, I can give its battery life a significant boost in the 15 minutes between waking up and starting my early morning jogs.What I didn't expect was that the Halo would replace all the Youtube channels and iOS apps I used to juggle to support my daily meditation and stretching routines. The movement assessments are amazing. If you're feeling modest, tight-fitting joggers or yoga pants are fine. In exchange, you get a customized routine that addresses your body's weaknesses. For the first time in my life, I look forward to stretching, and the results are speaking for themself. I'm feeling less lower back pain. I'm becoming more flexible. I'm more mindful of my movements in general. The meditation programs are also great, and I really appreciate the partnership with Headspace. The sleep tracking feature is also nice to have, but I always end up resting my head on my band, which ultimately hurts my wrist and leads to a fretful night's sleep. Not everyone will have this problem, of course.My only gripes are that the mobile app could be improved. My daily programs aren't always easy to access from the start page, and I would like to see more granular time series data for my exercises. But that isn't to say that the app isn't polished. It has plenty of quality of life enhancements already baked in, such as the ability to review movement performance by week and to skip introductions to videos.Anyway, I love this device. I tried to make my review as impartial as possible, but it's perfect for me. Many thanks to Amazon for offering this life changing product.",5
243,"I’m only giving this 3 stars for now and will update it after some time goes by.I just set mine up earlier today. It was a pain in the butt!! followed the directions to the T! It would not sync up. No matter what I did. Then it wouldn’t let me connect to the Bluetooth. I had to keep messing around with that. Halo was fully charged too. After about 3-4 hours it finally synced for me.Before buying this I didn’t realize my Bluetooth was gonna have to stay on to use this. All that does is kill your phones battery. I never use it unless I’m driving with it on the charger and listening to an app.Already, Some things are not accurate with the halo. Currently I’m in a wheel chair due to having surgery on both of my feet. I haven’t been able to walk for almost 3 months. The steps tracker on this, says I’ve walked over 800 steps within the last few hours.  The last 3 hours I’ve been lying in bed and I briefly got up and wheeled myself to use the bathroom and to get something to eat from the kitchen then back to bed. Clearly I didn’t walk lolSoooooo something isn’t right. obviously with every movement it “ thinks” I am walking when I’m not. I will not use this part of the halo for anything at this point....I do like how I can sync it with weight watchers and the health app within my iPhone. I’ll check them in a few days to see what info was transferred and to see if it’s remotely accurate. If not I’ll unsync them.I think this has potential but time will tell. Tracking my sleep is what originally sparked my interest.I’ll update my review as time goes on. Still debating if I’m going to keep or return it.",3
244,"I received the Halo as part of a WW health promotional. I have used it for a week and the following is my experience: I have enjoyed the Tone feature, as it’s been interesting to track my tone of voice throughout the day when interacting with others. I also used the body fat composition feature, and though I love the idea of the product bring able to measure my body fat and other areas of body composition, I do not think this feature is accurate. I regularly monitor my body fat at home and at a health story, using a body fat machine, and the Halo results were off by a significant percentage, not in my favor. 😂 If the body fat tracker feature were to have said my body fat was lower and closer to the number I actually think I’m near, I would be more inclined to believe it was functioning correctly. The Halo band has also tracked my steps, which is a fun feature. I’ve enjoyed monitoring how active I am or could be. I never tracked my sleep, which I think would have been interesting to monitor. I would have loved to track which hours I experienced REM sleep, how long it took me to fall asleep, and which hours or moments I woke up during the night. But I decided not to sleep with the band on because at the end of the day, after wearing it, I found that the inside of my wrist, deep inside the bone, was experiencing a weird ache. When this first occurred I adjusted the straps to make sure the band wasn’t too tight, but when I experienced the aching inside wrist, I decided I shouldn’t wear it anymore. I’m not saying everyone who uses the halo band will experience the same things I did, but even though I enjoyed the Halo band features that I tried out, I’m not sure that the aching inside my wrist is a side effect I’m willing to take.",3
245,"This provides an accurate report of sleep, heart rate and more.  I purchased this to wear when I'm working outside so I wouldn't risk damage my more expensive smart watch.  This has held up very well and still looks new.  I wish it had a better battery life, but for the size and functions 3-days is pretty good.",4
246,"Thanks to the pandemic I had been isolated and sedentary for over a year. Add stress eating to that and my new 'demic bod was decidedly....apple.I checked out the halo and dug deep into the reviews. Seems it was a love hate relationship but I decided to buy myself a mother's day present.It served as a visual reminder that I needed to get my @ss moving. Doing anything I could think of to get my heart rate up to get some extra points. (Washing the car, mowing the yard, parking at the far end of the lot)I thrive on goals and meeting a challenge. The app helped me to SEE what I needed to do and how to get there. The points, the steps, heart rate..  it was something to focus on that was positive. (Exactly what had been lacking for 2020)I dont really use the tone. It takes too much battery.The sleep info has been very interesting. Hot flashes are REAL. . I already knew it...but now I have data to show my scientist husband to ""confirm my theory"". (Insert eyeroll here).The band needs to be worn snug on the wrist above the wrist bone. Never been a problem until recently. Band has been loose and flopping around. I was getting irritated..  why did they make such a crappy band knowing people would wear it 24/7?? As I huffed and went to adjust the band it dawned on me. The band didn't stretch. My wrist shrank!!Go on Halo, gurl!!....do your thing!!",4
247,"I have been using this for about 2 months- I primarily purchased so I could start wearing a regular watch. I really like that there is no face on this, it did take some getting used to at first. The step tracking is spot on, I wore another fitness watch along with this the first few days and they both maintained a +-20 count for steps through the day. The sleep tracking seems to be on par as well, I can review the app and the previous nights sleep for Deep vs Light vs REM sleep and it does seem to track that pretty well- I usually awake after a strange dream and I can see based on the time I was awake and the REM sleep indicator it was at that time. I have tried the body scan feature- but I am not sold on that- it indicated I actually got heftier on my second scan by 2 percentage points for body fat! The activity points are still  bit confusing, I exercise daily with a minimum 2 mile run so I exceed the point goals on a weekly basis. The heart rate feature also seems to record correct values. I did play around with the voice feature, however it, as other reviews indicate, is a battery drainer so I turned that off. I have not used the discover portion in the app other than reviewing, it does offer some good insights into diet and exercise. Overall, I really really like this as a fitness band, its lightweight and I barely know I have it on after a few days getting used to it, its water proof so I can swim with it. I would recommend this.",4
248,"My husband really likes his Halo! He usually doesn't like to wear watches, but the band is comfortable and the Halo doesn't get in his way. His favorite part is the activity tracker and wellness goals- he has fun ""beating"" his goals because he's super competitive. I don't know if it has helped his sleep directly, but it's helped him relax during a take stressful time because he felt like he wasn't sleeping at all, but the sleep tracking showed that he was getting a couple of hours a night. I think the psychological effect of knowing that he really was getting at least some sleep helped.There are only two complaints:1. He is a little frustrated with the charger. It usually takes him a minute to get it connected and charging. I don't usually have trouble with it, but I watch him fiddling around with it every morning.2. I bought it because I was really excited about the ""tone of voice"" analysis. There's some disagreement about tone of voice sometimes in our house. According to the Halo, he has never sounded cheerful in the 3 months that he's been wearing it. While he's not most cheerful and chatty guy in the world, he's also not a monster. So he's stopped using the ""tone"" thing. I think it is possible that the Halo is not wrong, but there's no way to tell, and since he's frustrated by it now, he just doesn't want to use that function.Overall, it was a great purchase. He's been thinking about a Garmin tracker for awhile, but spending hundreds of dollars on something that he wasn't sure he'd like seemed silly. Now he's so happy with the Halo that I don't know if he's going to want to change!",4
249,"I used the Halo for about 2 months. I used all of the functions other than the classes since I have a peloton and box regularly. My main reason for purchasing the Halo was to monitor my sleep which hasn’t been great and track my activity. Ultimately, I stopped using it because I felt it to be rather unnecessary. Why? Here’s why:The point system for activity is a bit ridiculous. Maybe it’s because I’m super active but reaching 150 or even 300 points is insanely easy unless you are incredibly out of shape and literally do nothing all day. I would routinely get 5xs or the more the recommended 150 in a week. Not how that is helpful. It just tells ya to keep going.The sleep tracker at first seemed very targeted. It shows disturbances, time awake, asleep etc. I found it frustrating however because I’d be in bed for 7-9 hours and it may say I only got 5 hours of asleep and the wake times in the middle of the night were way longer than I remember them being. Just didn’t seem super accurate and ultimately other than saying to take it easy if I got less than 5 hours it didn’t really help with making me sleep better. Maybe it’s just me but without it I sleep better now because I’m not monitoring constantly.Tone is novel and kind of cool but drains the battery so you’d really need to be on it so it was always off.Body scan also novel but meh.Ultimately this product is a good start in some ways with a good app interface but not really helpful for someone like me.",3
250,"So I've been using this band for around 2 months so far and it's not a terrible product,  but not really great either.Pros-- Many of its features are rather nice, the activity monitoring is different from other products I've used because it monitors low, moderate, and high intensity activity and gives point values pertaining to each. It also tracks sedentary(non active) and decreases points. So that's a good easy to get me off my butt.- The 3D body composition feature is nice, and very different from other devices. Provides a more visual way to see progress without having to take selfies.- Lack of a screen does mean less distractions, for me that was a plus.-Price wasn't too bad.Cons-- Sleep tracking is very finicky, I slept better after I stopped using ther product and switched to another.- 3D modeling can be a demotivater for some users.- Really easy to trick the activity tracker. (Heavy breathing did actually trick mine)- The ""Tone"" feature is perhaps the most frustrating and demoralizing feature.  I apparently have ""resting bitch voice"" according to my device. Reset the presets three times with minimal change.  So either I'm a terrible speaker (good possibility) or the mic isn't great. I did actually have my wife try this, shes the bubbliest person I know, and according to the Halo she too is just monotone and unenthusiastic. So big nope.- Monthly subscription. May turn some off. Alot if the info is readily available online for free,  least I found if.  Labs are nice but felt underwhelming for me.- Charger design is not great,  struggled a lot to match up the diodes after the first two weeks.-Battery life isn't great either.  Keeps a full charge for little over 2 days for me.  (Using 24/7 aside from showers)Overall not bad but I've used better products in ther past.",3
251,"I have been using this device for nearly two weeks.  I like that it's comfortable, it fits (I have a very small wrist), and that it has a low profile.  What I don't like is the wild inaccuracy in assessing activities.  I was at the gym this morning and did 30 minutes of cycling and 45 minutes of weights.  It recognized NO activity.  I went to the chiropractor last week, and it registered 15 minutes of moderately intense activity during that period.  HOW???  Makes no sense.  I was doing yoga last week and it registered that I was running.  The sleep feature is questionable.  I have alot of insomnia, and it registered my lying quietly in bed not sleeping as light or REM sleep.  I tried the tone function and found it useless.  I deleted the base recording so it wouldn't drain the battery.  How do you use the activity videos on a small smart-phone screen?  I can't do a fitness session when I have to remain within a couple of feet of the phone in order to see the screen and the movements.  And if I want to keep the functionality after the 6 month trial of the app membership, I have to pay 4 bucks a month, making the price of the device $48 more per year, ever year.  On the bright side, it seems to count steps accurately and has no trouble recording my 2x weekly, 3 mile walk.  But I can get heart rate and steps tracking without paying $100 for the device and half that again each year.  Guess I'll be returning this little gem soon.  Oh well.",3
252,"The tracker is lightweight, comfortable, and accurate. The only thing I very much dislike is that the app is not available for my Amazon Kindle fire. The videos, especially for workouts are hard to watch on my tiny phone screen, while trying to do them. It would be nice if I could watch them on my fire, which is a much bigger screen. Doesn't make sense that the app is not available for the other Amazon device that I own.",4
253,"Sleep and other activities are tracked well. Band keeps a charge for 4 days without using voice recognition.  But it's infuriating that it won't fully track steps or activity on the treadmill. I've seen others make the same complaint and Amazon advises wearing the band tightly etc.  All stuff that I'm already doing. I think it's a flaw in the design. That said the band, it's data, advice and accessories are all great. Overall I enjoy wearing it.",4
254,"I bought this back in February from Target when Kelly Ripa talked about it. My main goal was to measure steps without carrying around my phone and to measure sleep. I thought the Tone feature would be a fun ""toy"". Here's the breakdown of features: 1) Pedometer: 5 stars, 2) Tone: 3 stars. Truly only something to play with. 3) Sleep: 2 stars. I have chronic conditions that affect my sleep. My ""nighttime"" sleep is rarely good but I wanted to measure it to compare with a medical sleep study. This feature would be good if, upon waking, you noted your scores so that you could reliably focus on your sleep issues. The problem with the Halo is that if you wake, for example, at 7a.m. after being in bed/sleeping for 8 hours (time in bed, 5. Time asleep,3), then, 5 hours later, take a 2 hour nap, the Halo logs those 5 hours as an interruption of the night's sleep and the 2 hours are added to the 3, making your log look like this: 11:00p.m until 3 p.m. with 6 hours Sleep, 10 hours Awake time, and, as mentioned, the 7am - 12pm time listed as an interruption.  The data from this sleep event all logged together really doesn't help to focus on one's nighttime sleep. There needs to be a way to set ""a personal bedtime span of hours"" so that your day sleep isn't thrown with the night sleep unless it is interrupted by only a few minutes. This way, if you are working with a health professional to try to get most of your effective sleep during the night, you can rely on this app. Otherwise, one needs to log the initial waking information onto another app or the information is not helpful for monitoring/changing habits of nighttime sleep.",3
255,"First of all, as a fitness tracker, this band certainly does its job, and does it well.  It's inoffensive looking, comfortable, the battery lasts for days, the app is useful and intuitive, etc.  I've had a number of similar fitness-oriented products (from Fitbits to Apple Watch, and a few in between), and this is an entirely valid option at a reasonable price point for that use case.  I'm sure someone going super deep on fitness tracking could find a better option, but I didn't feel like I was missing anything.However, what sets this product apart is the voice analysis tool.  Working from home, I'm aware that now, more than ever, tone plays a crucial role in how other perceive us.  During in-person encounters, we get tons of signals with body language.  Meeting people all day over video conference, however, removes a lot of that intuition and signal, so people have less to go on.  Tone is incredibly meaningful!I started using this band and within the first couple of days, realized that I wasn't coming across with the positive energy I was intending to bring to my meetings.  I was something like 90% neutral, with a few dips throughout the day into reserved, defensive, or negative tones.  The end!  Not only was this true with my meetings for work, but it applied to my family time as well.  I don't want my kids thinking of me as largely disaffected and occasionally negative.This caused me to be more intentional with my tone and how I was showing up with my voice.  Over the course of a few weeks, my charts started looking better - and more importantly, there was a noticeable difference in how I was being perceived with my co-workers as well as my family.  I'm having better days and building better relationships as a direct result of getting the feedback I needed, and the daily tracking that's helping me hold myself accountable for my tone and how others perceive me.One of the nice things I've found is that because it's an objective device, I can take feedback without getting defensive or arguing that I'm being misperceived, or that negativity wasn't my intent (for example).  It's just data that's directly helping me be better.",5
256,"I love this, but I can't give it 5 stars because there is no GPS tracking.  If you need instant gratification, like step count and heart rate, this is probably not the best fitness tracker for you.  There is no face on the band, so you would need to have your phone or tablet with to view your results real time. I was used to looking at my fitbit for my step count.  If you are motivated by a points system and looking for overall general results, I highly recommend the Halo.  150 points in a week is totally doable...  what i find interesting is that once you hit 150 points, it resets that week's goal to 300 points, which i get.  However, once you hit 300 points, your goal is adjusted to 600 points, when you think it would go up by 150 points each time.  Don't know what happens after 600 weekly points, though, because i haven't hit that one yet.  :)The app is simple to use and there are workouts, activities, nutrition, sleep, and tone of voice tips and videos to use pretty much anywhere.  I hate that i get negative points when i am sitting at my desk at work, so i found some helpful suggestions on the app on how to incorporate more movement during my workday to keep those negative points lower.  I did the body scan, and not gonna lie, it was a little humbling to see how my avatar looked.  And the amount of clothing on the avatar is definitely less than what i wore!! Lol. I am keeping my fitbit solely for the GPS feature.  I love everything else about the Halo.",4
257,"I've had this Halo since October 2020 & a year later I still wear this day & night to track as much as possible. I'm a high end painter so I move a lot when I work & long hours because of my workaholic tendencies. I absolutely love all the features especially the sleep, because it points out my issue which is sleeping for more then 5hrs. I know sleep is important but I go to bed & wake up rested with sleep under 7hrs. That's my peak & after a year of tracking I've seen where I needed to make improvements to help me get to sleep quicker & try to limit my disturbances so my little sleep goes much further.I like the points system & enjoy when it takes points when I don't move when I should. I can hit the extremely low & standard 150points in 2-3 days & I'm usually closer to the 600 which imo isn't great but I'm comfortable there. The app has so much to offer like workouts live by humans, meals & recipes, yoga, meditation, sleep calming methods, anti anxiety helping methods & sounds to sleep to. I seen a sedentary lifestyle individual post a bad review & blame their problems on the wrong thing. Running up & down stairs four times in 12hrs will not get you a good point count. Neither will a short three Mike run. To hit 150 you need to be active for a while & take health seriously. I have lazy days where I lose 11 to 20 points, but I'll do more work as that negative motivates me. I don't wanna be a baby acting adult & blame personal health choices on technology. So I'll say this. It's software that when you follow its rules you'll definitely see change in a good way. Make your own excuses & you'll see the exact opposite, which is bad results. Don't purchase this Halo if you've become accustom to blaming everything but yourself, it holds you accountable with data.",5
258,"I signed up for the beta version so I've had this a few months; I wanted to make sure I had experience with it over time to review. Overall, it's a pretty solid product. I like that there isn't a screen, but if you're a big tech person that might be a drawback. The app works well, I like it's sleep tracker and the way it calculates activity. The body scanner is cool and it's a good starting point before getting into any new diet or workout plans. I like the workout activities included as well as the wellness tracker and the other programs in the app. I never used the tone aspect, so I can't give an opinion on that. The band takes a few days to get used to but honestly I don't even feel it anymore. Depending on your arm size I can see it being pretty uncomfortable; I have thinner wrists so it sits comfortably without issues.I knocked a star off because the charging design SUCKS. I don't know if anyone else has had this problem yet, but the little charging metal corroded and WILL NOT connect to the clip. It takes me 5 minutes to get it seated properly on the clip to get it charging. When I first got it, it was first try, a few seconds, every time. For the life of me I can't get it to charge without a fight anymore. I hope in future designs that they figure out a way to have this physically plug in, or at the very least make the charging connection bigger so that there are less issues as the product ages.",4
259,"Halo is great! I love the sleep visual and step tracker. The movement analysis and body scans for body fat percentage are way cool. The corrective exercises recommended for me seem to be making a difference.I didn't give it a 5 rating because I have different definitions of sedentary and sleep than it does. I think I am asleep when I am not cognizant. It is measuring heart rate or something. It doesn't usually realize when I am in bed, and I'm pretty sure I am asleep before it thinks so and am not awake in the night as long as it says. On the other hand, sometimes it says I did get some sleep when I thought I was awake for hours. 🙂It docks points for being sedentary, which makes sense, but it counts time doing stretching exercises as sedentary as well as other low intensity activities. This makes the sedentary tracking pretty useless for me. I am 65, so I'm not going to be in vigorous motion all day every day.The app is interesting. It has exercise videos, recipes and programs to help with sleep. It can be a distraction. It's nice that I can save programs I like so I can find them quickly if they drop from the feed before I do them after the reminder.Bottom line, I love my Halo. I take the information I can use and don't fret over the rest.",4
260,"This was given to me as a gift and it definitely helped me start moving more because all of the sudden I saw just how much movement decreased since covid began.  But as far as my satisfaction with the band itself- I would have gone with a different product if I had to buy another one.  It’s not convenient not seeing anything on a screen and having to always pull up your phone to check.  The score you get for activity level is constantly inaccurate- my heart rate will show at 140 then suddenly 79 and I’m still moving- and nothing you do to adjust the band helps.  It’s a bit disappointing after a good workout to look at your app and see that you got 5 points.  Also needing to charge it every 2-3 days is a real nuisance because then you forget to put it back on and your whole days worth of activity is scrapped.  Now onto sleep.. ugh.  It’s total baloney.  Basically it only know that I woke up if I pick up my phone or actually get out of bed.  So nights when I barely sleep still show as a good sleep night on the app.  But then it shows me as asleep when I’m on the couch watching tv at 8 pm... I’ve e-mailed them about it they told me to factory reset and still I have the same issue.  The little lines of deep, rem and light sleep are complete bs.  It shows me in deep sleep when I’m awake sometimes so none of that is true- just random charts they show.  The voice feature is just confusing to me and I have no idea what it’s for.  It feels invasive and doesn’t give me any insight.  I turned that off ages ago.  So overall a so so device, I think there are better ones out there.",3
261,I primarily am using this product to “detect” my tone when I’m speaking. I have a hard time realizing how I come across as I speak. However this device and program could use a lot of help with this to make it more user friendly for THOSE WHO ARE BUYING IT TO HELP UNDERSTAND THEIR TONES OF VOICE WHEN SPEAKING.I understand the concern for privacy. However there should be an option to be able to select that would allow the user to review the tones of voice “phrases” that are recognized by the app for 24 hours before it is erased or 48 hours before erased.Or at the very least provide a list of “phrases” that are recognized under each tone category.” (Or until that option is available) otherwise there is  ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO LEARN FROM THIS- except for making an audio recording while doing the “Live” tone detector (which drains your HALO battery if done for longer than 20 ish minutes)- however I feel like I will have to do this so I can learn what/ how I’m saying that can be changed.I was however super excited when I found out the sleep detection ALSO will help detect changes in your body temp while you sleep this was important to me as well as I can see how it will help me find the temperature I need to sleep at for the best nights sleep.Please make the changes to make this a tool that people can use this to help themselves learn and improve the tone of voice that they are using with other people.,4
262,"This is a great little device.  The competitor to this product is the Whoop device.  Not other fit trackers that have screens and give you alerts for messages or calls and show the time.  Any review comparing this to any fit tracker with a screen or even a smartwatch are comparing apple to oranges.  To buy an apple or to buy an orange.It's smaller than its competitor, the Whoop - and smaller than many other fit trackers.  The user interface on the app is easy to use.  Lots of info, but no so much info it's confusing or overwhelming.  I like the lack of screen. It's just as expected - a much less distraction.The only complaint I have is that I feel the battery should last longer.  However, with that said - it charges super fast.The info is good, as long as you understand what your looking at or reading.The BMI feature - you DO NOT have to be naked.  The tone feature - hit or miss.  It also uses up battery power that I care to use elsewhere, so I turned it off.  Activity tracker - nice.  Sleep tracker - very nice.  Personal trending history - great.  Suggestions to improve in areas - good.Price - a much better deal than the Whoop.Remember - it's not a fitbit.  It's not a smartwatch.  It's not the usual fit tracker with a screen.*On a related but separate issue to this:I liked this so much, I wanted to purchase one for a friend battling cancer.I bought the Halo on early release and tried to email Amazon to ask for help.I tried using 3 different emails for Amazon and all came back not a monitored .",5
263,"I absolutely LOVE my Halo!!! O.M.G!!! Why did it take so long for this beauty to come into existence?!? Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!!! Everyone around me that I've told about this has been ready to buy one, even my husband the day it arrived (that says a lot! He and I both were skeptical this would be all it promised to be...  ...until that day!I do have one issue with it, though: Either the sleep needs to be able to register shorter time lines like power naps, or power naps need to be an addable activity that can automatically adjust the sleep log.  I would venture to think almost all, if not all, of a power nap is going to be equal to R.E.M. sleep. I know for a fact that's the case for me, anyway. So to have the ability to add a 1 hr to 1 1/2 hr power nap to my activity logs allows me to see that additional R.E.M. time that I'm currently missing a large part of, while at the same time being able to erase a large part of what's currently showing up as excessive sedentary time because it's not actually excessive sedentary time but rather sleep time.Aside from that, I'm still learning how to work it.  So anything new I may one day have to say on this matter, I will be sure to update everyone with a quickness. I haven't done anything with the body fat aspect yet because it utilizes the phone's camera to get out set up and going, and I currently have a colostomy bag attached to my belly. I don't see it being capable of being accurate enough for me until I get that reversed. So, once that's fixed I'll go to town with that aspect of the Halo, as well, and update the world on my opinions of that part.Until then, thanks again, Amazon, for my beautiful Christmas gift! Santa had to deliver it a month & a half early cuz he had so much on his plate this year, but don't be upset with him about that... He and I have had an understanding on that for decades already: Christmas happens all year round for me!  😁😁",5
264,"I really like my Amazon Halo. It took me a while to get used to wearing something on my wrist, but now I barely notice it's there (although I have wacked it on a few things - seems durable!). I have pretty small wrists and went with the M. I should have gotten the small as my medium is all cinched up. I think the cloth has stretched a bit with time, which is a good comfort thing I suppose.I use the Halo for workout tracking - it's nice to see steps and my activity level throughout the day. I'm a teacher and thought my lifestyle was pretty active, but I actually found out I'm rather sedentary. That has helped me change my activity level quite a bit. It tracks runs / walks very well automatically.I also use it for sleep tracking. It might be the power of suggestion, but just seeing that I slept ""good"" or ""great"" makes me feel better in the morning. I also feel like I take forever to fall asleep, but in reality it's only a few minutes. It's peace of mind for me.I don't use the Halo's workout programs and don't intend on renewing my subscription to those things after the 6 months free period ends. I also don't use it for voice analysis. That didn't seem pertinent to me.I do appreciate the offering of BMI analysis. I was actually shocked at my body fat percentage being ""too high"" as I'm a slender person. But it has helped me see I need to gain more muscle mass. I might consider paying the monthly fee every once in a while when I want to use the BMI feature and track my progress.",4
265,"There seems to be so many complaints about this product, yet the complaining seems to stem from things this product never advertised as having or the complainers need validation from this product. So silly. I didn't want a watch face, I didn't want text capabilities, I didn't want an alarm. Therefore, this product fits my needs plus extras. It does what it says that it does and it does it well. I wear it basically 24/7, except for charge time and it is now like a second skin for me. I wear it in the shower and in our saltwater swimming pool. The Velco still sticks well (I was concerned at first due to the small Velcro strip size), but the small strips have done well at maintaining their integrity and the band dries out fairly fast after it gets wet. The Halo stays on my wrist nicely (snug and secure) and it is semi-low profile and I feel trendy looking.Two things that I feel would be an improvement for Amazon to consider is for the product to (1) take blood pressure readings (2) give distance conversion based on the step you take. With these added features, it could be a near-perfect product in its class.Other than that, I love the sleep diagnosis function, the tone reader, the step monitor, the heart rate feature, and the BMI  tracker (BTW- I wear tight and sexy underwear for the BMI picture, so if anyone is looking, they get some eye-candy).I give this product a 4.5 out of 5 for doing what it says it will do-function, reliability.",4
266,I got this as part of the early release for the main reason of not having to carry my phone around to track my steps. The best part that I like is the band. I've owned a few Fitbit bands and the issue was the very expensive band breaking and Fitbit's only resolve was to purchase a new one with a 10-20% discount. The way this band snaps into place I can't ever see it breaking and if it should the band is cheaply and easily replaceable. I also like how long it holds a charge. Without using features such as tone it lasts for a week or seems before needing a charge. I wish it would buzz or ding though when it needs to be charged. I may have gotten a phone notification but one day it died on me in the middle of the day and i didn't know until i checked the app that night. Tone tracking was weird and might be inaccurate. Sometimes it would track that I was upset or angry when I was excited and other tracking seemed a little inaccurate. Sleep tracking was a bit inaccurate. I did like seeing how long it took to fall asleep and the times I would awake. I tried some of the labs and those were interesting although sometimes it would say i completed the current day instead of the night before which was annoying. Although it's water proof I never wore it in the shower I think that's gross. The band was easy to charge. I like how it tracks heart rate. I wish it would connect to my job health plan which tracks steps but maybe they'll branch out later or come out with a newer version. Overall it's OK. Some people are visual which there's absolutely nothing to see on this band but I like that there are literally no distractions. I usually forget I'm even wearing it.,3
267,"Love the concept, but the accuracy is very lacking so farPros:- Comfortable to wear.- Looks stylish and unassuming. I like that it doesn't try to be a watch.- App design is pretty good.- Holds charge well.Cons:- Not sure if user error, but it has been really off on tracking activity. Two examples stand out. First, I was cleaning the house all day long. Non stop going up and down stairs and on my feet all day. At the end of the day I was ready to bask in all the movement points and see how many steps I had completed. However, the device claimed I was sedentary all day long! Second example, it doesn't seem to track my weight lifting workouts. Unless I'm doing intense cardio it always thinks I'm being sedentary.- The voice analyzation is fun, but not that useful. For normal talking, the results are rather obvious what they will be. Perhaps, for those in major self denial it's a more useful tool. Main issue I have is that I often sing throughout the day while in the house. The device detects this as me being angry! Ironic because I'm singing when I'm in a good mood. Maybe my singing is bad so the device is trying to tell me this will anger other people!As for the sleep functionality, I can't speak much to that since I didn't use the feature. I've never worn a watch or bracelet on the regular. So, I just can't fall asleep with the device on. So, that's more on me. Maybe in some future version the entire device will be more band-like without the plastic bump and that would be more comfortable.Overall, I've had fun playing around with device to see what it was like. However, in its current state, I'll be holding off on wearing it as an everyday part of my life.",3
268,"I'll start out by saying that the Halo does provide pretty good sleep tracking metrics. I found it to be reasonably accurate for time to fall asleep, time awake, and deep sleep. Things like body temperature? Not so much. I could wake up drenched it sweat (which I did on multiple occasions) for the tracker to tell me my temperature averaged -.5 cooler than average. The decent battery life means that you can easily wear it throughout the day and still wear it in bed that evening. I recommend throwing it on the charger for a shower and you should be good to go.Unfortunately thats about where the positive stops. That charger? Worst standard in any industry. The aggravation from just getting the charging dock to mate was ridiculous. No guide, notches, magnetics, nothing. Just constantly manipulation of the device until the light turns on. Oh, but its not instant, so move the device a few mm, and wait to see if it worked. Nope? Move it a bit more. Nope? Move it a bit more. Lather, rinse, repeat.The activity tracking is poor. The number system is gimmicky. I am an endurance athlete and my weekly score would push into the multiple hundreds but that was it. No real tdee or calorie burn, rmr or anything like that.The BMI assessment I'm on the fence about, it might be decently accurate? I have a visible six pack of abs, v pelvis root and all that, I work out alot. I weigh 64 KG. The app puts me at 18.1% bodyfat. I am a male and I wear size ""s"" in almost every brand, xs in some as well.The heart rate monitoring just absolutely destroys the battery, so does active voice monitoring. Passively you can wear it all day and it will really only grab a few data points. If you desire more active monitoring, the battery simply won't last.The app was decent. I actually enjoyed playing with the different things like meditation before bedtime. Only the device you were running it on (iphone here) had to stay awake. So you want to meditate before bed? Your iphone has to be screen on, in your dark room. Tap the lock button and it dies like youtube freemium.It was close, very close. The problems could be easily rectified but then again, I think that would drive the price up a bit and it would no longer be the affordable amazon product. I firmly believe Amazon is going to market this device as a corporate wellness thing and offer health insurance at a discount if employees wear it or something along those lines.in summary, this would be great for my 65 year old mother to wear while she walks around the block. For anyone into actual fitness, data points, or analysis, it's a joke.",2
269,"It's ok, it does what it says on the package, but if you have a desk job give up on getting enough points to make it happy. I tried the tone thing a little, but as I talk to myself (working from home) it's not the most accurate thing for me. What killed it for me though is that it triggers the tendonitis in my wrist. After wearing it for only a couple of days I start having a lot of pain in my wrist. I stop wearing it and the pain goes away. I bought another smartwatch/fitness tracker and had the same issue so I am going to assume it is an issue with my wrist that most people won't have to deal with.",4
270,I love that I can put it on my ankle because I can't wear a watch due to my profession. The purchased the large.,5
271,"I got this item during the beta period for about $70 or so, and I'd say that's about what it's worth. I won't use the body scanner because trying it out felt degrading, so I can't give you a review of that. The sleep tracking accuracy seems decent enough, you get a lot of data out of that. The labs and tone features are also great. However the actual tracking accuracy is horrendous.I use Ring Fit Adventure to track myself on a regular ""5 mile jog"" and have watched my heart rate in the app be in the medium to intense zone (up to nearly 180 bpm) for 20+ minutes during this time. However, when I synced the band to check my score, the app recorded me as having 5 minutes of medium exercise. What I've learned is that to get credit for any exercise, you have to be constantly moving your arms. So now I jog in place pumping my arms wildly so that my exercise actually gets tracked. Hope you weren't expecting to get credit for doing one of the many yoga labs!But I won't be returning it because I actually really love the labs feature. Even if I don't get credit for them, there's some great classes in there and the notifications remind me to move more often. Plus the fact that I do at least get credit in the form of a little tick for every day I do my class is surprisingly good reinforcement. I've been using this for about a month and a half and I've got at least a little bit of a workout in almost every single day. I've never been this consistent about exercise in my life. To me that's worth the $70, but because of the significant accuracy flaws, I can't recommend it at the current price or to anyone who already has a good fitness regimen",3
272,"UPDATE: I have to walk this back a bit. Now that I have had this for 2 months. The band still works great but I bought this to track activity in my weight watchers app. It stopped doing that several days ago. I trouble shot it. Reset both the band and the WW app but still it doesn’t. So it’s not as accurate when I manually put in the information on ww. So it doesn’t serve it’s purpose anymore. Going to have to look into something else. If ur using a different it to monitor urself it’s fine but I bought this specifically to link to ww.So I have had a fitbit but didn't like it. I thought about getting an apple iwatch but I have numerous watches that I like to wear. Surprise, I gained some lbs with covid quarentine so I signed up for weight watchers (lost 25lbs) and I saw that the Halo connected to the Weight watchers app.  PROS: Set up was easy. I wear it right above my watch and it doesn't look bad. It tracks my activity and syncs directly to my WW app. I am able to take body scans that give me an idea of body fat composition and can track my heart rate. It is easy to charge and sends you a message on your cell when its fully charged or low battery. CONS: although it does track my sleep, I have to put it in my WW app manually, It can track my mood by the sound of my voice but it uses a lot of battery. Although it looks good, just a simple band, I wish I could wear it on my ankle. I'm Very happy I got this and it motivates me to get in my 10,000 steps daily! Would buy again. Plus I did the pre-order and got it for 60.00 Bonus!",3
273,"I have had this for about six months now and really want to like it. The sleep tracking is top notch and I like the live heart rate. The labs are fun and the activity levels seem pretty accurate. I love the ability to track everything and see visualizations of the data at a glance.That's where the love ends. The voice recognition idea is pretty cool and I did try to use it for a while, but it drains the battery so fast I have to charge it, usually overnight, meaning I then miss out on sleep data for that night. The app has some issues. Namely, if you turn your Bluetooth off even momentarily, it sometimes unpairs the band completely which makes you have to reset everything through the app. Sometimes this means pressing the button on your band, sometimes you have to start over as if you'd just purchased it. The kicker is that even if you get back in through your same account with the same band, it deletes all your previous information. So I have lost all that history several times now.This time I've purchased a new phone, and this time it won't even send me the text code to get in to my account. It just tells me ""try again tomorrow"". I am heading out for a weekend of hiking and have been trying to monitor my activity to report back to my cardiologist. It's disappointing that I've had the new phone set up for a week, amazon is happy to let me into my account to buy things, but not to use this band. I feel a little swindled that the whole reason I purchased this band was for features that have only sporadically worked. This time I'm annoyed enough to cancel the service.",3
274,I just want to write a quick review. I read all the negative reviews but still wanted to give the Halo a shot and boy am I glad I did! So much so I ordered another for my daughter for Christmas (had to request a second invitation).Fit... Read a lot of bad reviews about how uncomfortable or painful this is to wear. I have tried other fit devices and I will say this is the only one I have ever worn and forgot I was wearing it!  My other devices wouldn't last 2 days on before I took them off never to wear again... Including a Apple Watch. So honestly this will be a individual preference.  It may work for you or it may not but don't not order for that reason alone. Everyone's writes are different.Sleep... This tracks my sleep better than any device I have tried. Everything it tells me is great and also makes me aware of just how bad I sleep lol.Tone... This is interesting. I've only tried it one day but was kinda fun seeing what it says. I will probably turn this off to have my battery last longer. I really don't care how I sound to people lol but fun just the same.The app has lots of great features that I look forward to learning more about. I haven't done the body scan yet but will.All and all I feel this is a great device! Will be great if it can check body temperature at some point which think is coming since it shows body temperature during sleep but don't think that's up and running yet.,4
275,"I personally like Halo. My wife is a fitbit person and likes the screen all the tricks. I on the other hand prefer the minimal approach. Its the digital age, we all have our phones on us. I don't want another phone on my wrist.I like how you can see live HR and tone. The tone is surprisingly accurate. The tone feature is useful if you're someone like me where no matter what you do most people take you as gruff and cold. I'm better with written words than spoken words.The app could use some improvements. First I would like to see is to be able to track HR on the graph. All it does is give a line graph and what it counts as your avg HR. Not as accurate it could be.I also got the large band and it has plenty of room. You will probably want to cycle on and off the tone, it drains the battery fast.The body scan is awesome and humbling. Ive lost 85 lbs and feel good about myself. I did the scan and Halo said I still have a long way but it is what it is, health is a journey and I've came a long way.Basically if you want a truthful minimalistic useful fitness band this is it.Also body temperature needs to be able tracked to. It also gave another line graph where nothing could be analyzed.",4
276,"So, i have had this for a few months now and the TLDR version of this is it is mostly good, except the band had significant discoloring issues.The tone feature is cool, but unless you have a real problem with sounding like a jerk, i turn it off to keep the battery life in the 4-6 day time frameThe photo analysis is cool and seems to work well as I am loosing weight.  A really cool plus on the product.Moving away from steps and into points is just smart, especially for someone like me who is in front of a computer all day. Also steps don’t appear on an elliptical all that well. However point system based on heartbeat allows me not to feel like a slouch with 5000 steps a day while I also spent 30 minutes working out with a heart in the 120-135 bpm range.The live BPM screen is really nice when working out to ensure you are not being lazy and keeping it in the right range maximizing your points per minute.The app is good but has two major issues. First, there is no easy way to input weight.  Second, there is bo interface to the Apple health suite - they cannot talk to each other.Now the down side is the band.  While the band is comfortable, the snow color sucks up ink from other textiles. I have white sheets with red snowflakes and 1 night sleeping on then my band had red ink that I cannot remove.You might ask, why not get a new band?  Well with the stock depleted the costs are $30 per band. Seeing i bought the whole thing for $50 before it was officially released, I cannot justify the cost.  Also a lot of the bands are on backorder spanning months!",3
277,"Updated review:. I've been wearing this for over 3 months now and don't like it as much as when I started.  The band is hard to keep clean.  The body scanner isnt even a displayed scan of your actual body so you can't use it to tell if specific areas are improved.  The app doesn't integrate with other apps like other bands do...I thought they'd make that happen faster.  I just ordered a garmin vivosmart4 that can do all the same things this band can do plus pulse ox.  My biggest complaint is that the 150 move minutes can't be adjusted and if you have a desk job it's highly demotivating to get tons of points deducted for being sedentary.  The garmin says it adjusts the goal to be challenging for the individual...we can't all be daily athletes. I think I'll get over that it counts in steps as long as it adds appropriate amount equivalent when I do bike rides. I never did turn speech back on and didn't miss it.Original review:  I like that it doesn't have a screen that both causes a distraction and eats up battery power.  The way it records activity and takes away points for being sedentary makes more sense to me than just tracking steps. I'm not a fan of step tracking since there are many activities which are not 'steps' but are still movement.  Speech tone was interesting but not worth the battery drain...I'd many turn it back on if I had some special reason but otherwise have it off to get more battery life.If you follow the instructions...it doesn't fit too tight or too loose.  The charger is easy to use if you take two seconds to see how it needs to fit in it.  It charges pretty quickly and provides a phone notification upon charge.I've had it for about a month now and can talk I'm going to need to clean the pink fabric band soon.  Thinking maybe I should have ordered black but wanted the rose gold color and knew I could get a replacement band.  It's not clean how to remove the band, there are probably instructions somewhere.I haven't lost any weight due to this band...but it's made me more aware of how much (little) I move and also gives insight to what helps me sleep better.  I like the idea of labs of things to try...I hope to see those improve.  It doesn't make sense to do more than one of them at a time if the goal is to see if they actually work for you, some guidance on which ones should be combined and an easy way to repeat a lab would be good.Overall, would recommend.  Exception is anyone with body dismorphia might want to avoid the body scanner.",2
278,"Nice sleep/step tracking, low profile and comfortable to wear. But I quit wearing mine months ago. While the concept of having a tracking monitor without a display to avoid distractions seems like a good idea at face value, I personally like the idea of being able to easily see my stats periodically throughout the day without having to take out my phone, update it to then see where I stand.The tone of voice monitor lacks immediate haptic feedback such that when I supposedly raised my tone of voice I would be immediately ""corrected"". Instead, while I can use my phone later in the day to tell me what time of the day I raised my tone.... how am I supposed to remember what it was I exactly said at the time and the context of what I said when I said it? Many times I was shouting out the door to get the dog to come in but found later that I was being ""reprimanded"" for raising my voice tone! For me, the voice tone monitor was relatively and realistically useless.The body composition function was the only really ""neat"" thing that I found pretty useful. But that functionality has nothing to do with the band and is solely a function of the phone app.So... the bottom line, at least for me, is that I did not find enough useful features in this device to sign on to the monthly fee.  Instead, I purchased a watch style monitor which tracks sleep, steps, heart rate, Blood Ox and displays messages and incoming call info and so on for a one time $25 and no monthly charges.",3
279,"I use this only for sleep tracking and occasional body scans. The halo does a great job knowing when I'm actually asleep instead of lying in my bed reading, unlike my Garmin. I also felt that the stages of sleep were accurately tracked.Halo is pretty decent at activity tracking- it knows when I go for a walk and it's good about knowing how long those walks last.  It is TERRIBLE at estimating steps and I wouldn't trust the step counter at all. So far today my Garmin and phone have counted around 6k steps whole the halo has logged only 1k. Yikes. Halo is not great at tracking intense activity- I don’t get the amount of points I should when doing something that really brings up my heart rate, like mountain biking.Another thing that is pretty accurate is the body scan. About a six weeks after getting the halo and using the scan and I did a dexa scan to compare and they were very close. It does take a few scans and some fiddling with lighting for the halo to gain true accuracy, however. I turned tone off after two days of being told I was negative; apparently halo doesn't understand sarcasm.Overall it's a 2.5 with some useful features and some that need work. I haven't used the labs because I have a pretty good exercise and nutrition routine in place and didn't need the extra motivation. It may be a good device for sometime who doesn't need the extensive activity tracking like you get with fitbit or garmin or notifications you get from a smartwatch. Just be sure to wear a pedometer or carry your phone if you want to be keep an accurate step count.",3
280,"1) Annoying to wear; noticeable all the time.2) Painful to wear; stupid design since it knowingly spans across two bones and presses down between them. Not like this isn't a well known problem with any wrist-wearable shaped like this.3) Functionally Useless... sure, it measures, but you have to have the app and a phone, otherwise it's basically just bad, styleless jewelery. Without a watch function, I still need to wear my Wyze Watch... and use it for a step count when out walking, heart rate and O² Saturation when working out because I actually need to keep an eye on those things while working out.I forget my Wyze Watch is even on my left wrist.I have wrist and hand pain with the Halo on my right wrist.The data seems okay BUT I have to keep forcing it to pair and sync.Honestly, it's not worth the money, pain & suffering.The Wyze Watch is sold on Amazon, with Alexa capability, for around 80% less than the Halo.If it can't show me anything, then it sure as heck better not be designed to inflict pain. It's supposed to be snug, but that's even more painful.I cannot recommend this product at this point.UPDATE: 11JUL2020In all fairness to Amazon, I did continue trying the Halo... Unfortunately, beyond the Return Window.For a large, padded wrist, this might be comfortable, but the Halo housing is simply too uncomfortable because it literally rides on the long bones of your forearm.Perhaps if it was designed to sit parallel to the bones and thus between them, much like the early and current Garmin devices, then it would be tolerable.Yes, odd looking BUT we've seen that parallel device design since at least the 1970's.There was a good reason that shows like Star Trek, Galactica, etc featured such item designs for the wrist... not only because they made sense in the way that they were used (same as the Garmin) BUT ALSO BECAUSE they were simply the most comfortable design.Had today's engineers actually used  fitness devices OR asked Amazon customers AND had them tested by Amazon customers (especially devoted daily users, like myself), then they would NOT have designed this in this way.It's not even heavy enough to be a decent paperweight, but it's definitely 100% as useless as garbage.I can't Return this now, because I really wanted to give it a good try.Why? Because Amazon did reach out immediately after posting my review in order to address my concerns.I just never could get used to the irritation/aching pain of the Halo on my bones AND THAT RUINED MY SLEEP CYCLES.That constant ache made going to sleep nearly impossible and I never achieved deep sleep... and barely achieved light sleep.I was basically awake and tossing and turning all night, every night.Next time, I won't be so generous.However, I can say that the device works and the data seemed to be on-point.Still, I simply cannot recommend this device, even for devoted fitness monitoring.And with this design, it wouldn't matter at this point if it did have a traditional watch screen interface.",1
281,"**update** 7-16-21- Upon writing my first review, Amazon quickly called me and talked me through updating the app. Which was excellent customer service. I was surprised Amazon reached out to me through a phone call and were really personable and nice!Recently I went surfing in the Ocean.  My Halo disconnected from my phone and will no longer power on, even after allowing it to ""dry out"" in the sun for two days.  I have had success swimming in the pool and it accurately tracking my fitness exertion . However, I do not believe this was meant for the ocean. It was fun while it lasted. Unfortunately my product support ended 7 days ago.I have an Iphone 6, I just did a recent IoS update and Halo App update. Since this change the app will crash as soon as I open it.  It syncs okay and the scores seem accurate, if the app will stay open.  I don't see anything for support on here. It may be because I have a older phone, but the app isn't huge so I am unsure why I am experiencing this.  I haven't tried the voice feature yet. I bought it in January 2021.  I like know that I am working out so it is somewhat motivating. I haven't tried to use any of the workout programs that come with it.  It seems like it is going to lose many features after the trial is over. I probably will have to let it go then.",4
282,"I have been using this since the middle of December. It was about that time I decided to get off my lazy fat arse and start doing some excercise so I began doing peloton classes. The halo has been great at showing me how my body is changing.Right now, I do about an hour of classes 6 days a week, then walk 18 holes of golf on a Sunday. I get anywhere between 700 and 750 points a week. I find it motivational to try and beat my score each week. I do the workouts on the bike using a Scosche rhythm + monitor. On the 2 rides I completed this evening, the max heart rates on the Scosche were 156 and 152. On the halo they were 154 and 149. Not too bad.It’s interesting to see how much sleep and the type of sleep I get. Not sure how accurate it is, but I feel better when my sleep score is higher for sure.The body fat, yeah, you have to strip down, but I let it tell me my body fat percentage, then delete the results and just record the percentage on my iPhone health app. Again, not sure how accurate it is, but I’m using the same system each time, and again, I can see my body fat going down slowly.Haven’t tried the tone analysis, nor will I. That to me seems like a gimmick.I enjoy wearing watches, so I wanted a tracker without a screen. The halo is comfortable and doesn’t look ridiculous when wearing a watch on the other wrist.All in all, I’m impressed. It motivates me to keep trying to get fitter, to lose more weight and to keep moving. I also love able to see the changes that have been going on with my body since I started working out (body fat %, change in resting heart rate, activity score etc).I’m a big fan and would have no hesitation recommending it. When I read the bad reviews, I don’t recognize the experience at all.",5
283,"I'm amazed at how much data collection + smarts are under-the-hood here, especially at this price point.Positives for me:+ The insights feed in the Halo app is pretty awesome, and reflects how I'm doing, though could use some tweaking at times (see below.)+ Body scans and the recently released movement scans are killer features for me - if those continue to improve and iterate, this will be a significant competitive moat vs. other trackers and fitness tools.+ No notifications: the fact that my fitness tracker is purely a tracker is a feature, not a bug, to me, and I love the minimalist approach.+ Focus on holistic health, rather than just a single area (steps, sleep, nutrition, etc.)+ The breadth of activities and programs that keep getting added to the app continue to surprise me - keep this up!+ Sleep tracking is pretty reliableNegatives:- The insights feed algorithm needs a little tweaking. Example: if I have a rough night of sleep, the feed is smart enough to recommend ""You should take it easy today."" Which is awesome! However, this is dampened by the fact that the next card in the feed is a set of HIIT workouts...the OPPOSITE of taking it easy haha.- Tone has _so_ much potential, and I love the iterations the team has released (especially with calendar sync so that I can correlate results with certain meetings,) however I don't trust that the voice model is 100% accurate - particularly in two ways. 1) I'm not convinced it's only using _my_ voice, versus someone else talking in the room, or perhaps a TV show I'm watching. 2) I can't see what phrases it picked up, and how it categorized my tone or energy level. Seeing a feed of phrases + how Tone categorized that phrase, as well as having ability to adjust what are false positives / negatives (literally) would help here.- I love to surf & swim, so having a waterproof model would be awesome.",5
284,I was enjoying the band I bought it on prime days sale. I've had it 2 days. I go tonight to open the app to see data from today and the whole app is reset. I had to redo everything and reset my band. Lost some data. Epdate: This has happened 3 times total. Amazon Contacted me the day after I left this review. They were very helpful and had me send them some diagnostic Information. The band is working now.,4
285,"I use it for all functions. I've been getting the best sleep of the last 6 years since getting this band, listening to the stories the stories, puts me to sleep.  I drift off and the band tells me how long it took me to fall asleep among other things while sleeping.  So far I've listened to the Sherlock Holmes stories and and the mythical ones about fairies there is. I would suggest those first.  The storyteller's voice is very soothing.The exercises are also amazing. As low as 5 minutes!I've made almost double or triple my points every day, my side job has a lot of movement.The battery can last almost 6 days if you turn off the voice tracker.  I only gave the product 4 stars because if you use the voice tracker, which lets you know how you sound to other people when speaking, then your battery only lasts for about 2 days, if that. I cut the voice tracker down to 10 minutes A-day.I don't like the fact there is no time.  Now I have to wear 2 watches... or rather one watch and 1 band.  With my fitbit I check to see if the band is accurate curate, and it is on the heart, it does a better job at tracking calories and footsteps. If you don't love it you can return it.",4
286,"I have been using the Amazon Halo for about two months now and after previously wearing a WHOOP strap, I am disappointed. I'm not a huge fan of the app or the layout, it's not very personal as you have one page that shows tiles of your points, sleep, tone, and body scan with minimal information. The activity tracker is not what I had expected, there doesn't seem to be a GPS option to record routes of runs/bike rides, the point system is based on heart rate levels which I like but I'm still not sure how to understand my score and It automatically starts tracking workouts for me all the time when I'm doing nothing. Body scan is a neat option that gives you better insight than BMI or most body fat % calculators, I really like this feature. Tone is cool for the first day then you realize how much it drains your battery and its no longer worth it. It's also impossible to know what conversation you were having or what you even said during the times it was analyzed so it does give you an overall idea of how you communicate but other than that I got nothing out of it and don't use it at all. Sleep tracking is solid and gives you a lot of information, my only problem is it doesn't record additional sleep throughout the day to add to your total, and if you wake up in the morning and fall back asleep sometimes the latter portion will not be recorded. Overall, not great. Potential to be much better but the app needs a lot of work and functionality needs to improve. If you are just getting into fitness or trying to encourage a positive lifestyle this would be good but I wouldn't recommend it for anything other than that.",3
287,"I already owned a Fitbit and purchased this to see how it would compare.1) One thing I did prefer about this over my Fitbit was the strap.  Its a cloth like strap that goes over your wrist.  It doesn't have a claps like the Fitbit does.  IMO it was a little more comfortable and I think that it would be a little more durable.  I ended up replacing my Fitbit strap after about a year because it broke.2) I didn't think I would but I ended up missing not having a face on my device.  There's no display at all.  you need to go to the app for everything.  Things the Fitbit did that I missed were vibrate when I reached a daily milestone like steps or calories burned.  This device probably does that but you'll have to check the app to see what it's notifying you about.One think I really liked was the body composition feature.  You take multiple screenshots of your body from different angles and the app puts them together into a model thats shown in the app.  If gives you a rough estimate of body fat and you can clearly track and see progress.  I get that some may find this creepy but keep in mind that the photos do not show your face.  Its all confidential and you are buying this to monitor your health after all.That all said, I don't want another subscription service.  The premium version of this really should be included with my Prime subscription but sadly it isn't.  Because of this I ultimately returned it because the free version really isn't any better than what Fitbit offers for no monthly subscription.",3
288,"I got my Halo early, so I have had it for a few months now. I was waiting to write my review until I had been using it for awhile. I really can't give it any more than 3 stars because it has the ability to be so much better.I'll start with the pros.1. It is lightweight and compact. I can wear it without really noticing it is there and it is comfortable to sleep with it on.2. The sleep tracker seems to be pretty accurate and it is interesting to see how well you slept. It breaks down your sleep, showing you light, deep and rem sleep, which is a nice feature.3. The body scan is a nice way to track your progress thru pictures.Ok, now the cons.1. It only tracks walking and running. All other exercises, whether it be weight lifting, bicycling, yoga etc., all have be added manually.  Even the most basic fitness trackers have better abilities to track activity.2. While the body scan feature is a nice way to track your progress in photos, it doesn't seem to be very accurate.3. If you have the tone feature on, the battery doesn't last a day.  I turned that feature off after three days because I was sick of having to charge it.4. The monthly subscription isn't worth it.  Not only because other fitness trackers are free, but also because what you are paying for doesn't seem worth it. If you keep tone on, you have to recharge your battery everyday. If you use the body scanner, it isnt that accurate. And you have to manually enter most of your workouts anyway.I was really expecting to like the Halo, but it has turned out to be a real let down.",3
289,"First - I like this tracker and am glad I purchased it. Just want to say that up front. I think the step and sleep tracing are very accurate. I love the body scan featureMy frustration is the app. The app provides a lot of synthesized data - basically you get the analysis of your data. It’s cool. My frustration is that you cannot view your individual data points. You only have access to the analyzed/synthesized data and Halo’s interpretation of that data. I want to see my individual data points. But that’s me. You may not. The analyses are fine and helpful, don’t get me wrong, I just want to be able to geek out.",3
290,"I like this little tracker for it's light weight an simple design although even a simple clock readout would be nice.  It appears to track steps and sleep accurately as compared to smart watch I wear. I have the medium, as the size given overlapped with the small. I have a small wrist but did not want the band to be tight. So.the medium fits but wraps all the way around. I also feel like the material is a bit thin and the pink got faded and dirty looking quickly with normal wear; I don't usually get into very dirty situations so I am surprised to see how the band looks. I would get a darker one next time. My only real complaint is the charger. It is a bit awkward to put the band into it. It is a slippery little clip, you have to pinch it open and slide the band in with the right side inward. It pops  out of my hand easily and always have to pick it up and try again. Looking at the clip there is no mark to see which way to turn it to put the band in. By trying to open it, hold an open and look in, it pops out of my grip. The cord is very thin and I worry it may not last long. A better charger would be great.  Speaking of charge, I don't use the voice tone monitor so I get about 3 -4 days out of  a charge. Connecting it to my phone ( android) .was difficult...it would not pair. It had to be installed uninstalled multiple times until it finally paired. Then my phone broke and the replacement had the same issue..and I had to call for support which was excellent. A real person answered quickly and patiently worked with me until we got it paired. Overall I do like the Halo and will continue using it for steps and sleep only. I would give 5 stars if it had an easier to use charger, better pairing function and maybe a better band. I do not expect to maintain the monthly subscription.",5
291,"This tracker seems to be fairly accurate if you keep it all in perspective and don't try to compare apples to oranges.  The app still needs work.  I swim every day at the same time, yet it keeps labeling it a ""walk"".  You think it would learn that I keep changing it to swim and label it that going forward.I couldn't find a good place to keep it on my wrist as I also have a smart watch that on wear on my left wrist.  Keeping the halo on the right hand interfered with using my mouse.  So, since I noticed the sport band is quite long, I tried putting it on my ankle.  It uses the last hole, but it fits comfortably.  It may mess up the counting and such, but I figure if I always wear it there, I'll always be able to compare data equally.  I wear it just about all day every day, after the move to my ankle, and it is much easier to forget it's on and I get real 24/7 tracking.  It's even better wearing it that way at night, since I'm a stomach sleeper and often have one arm under my pillow, wearing it on my wrist seems awkward too.PLEASE amazon, make more bands that can be worn on the ankle and adjust your algorithms for that option, it is MUCH better and less obtrusive.",4
292,"I loved my Halo for the first few months but now I have nothing but problems.  The most frustrating issue is syncing with the app.  Every time I open the app, it the band tries to sync I get a message saying it can’t retrieve my data.  Eventually it works but sometimes it’s hours later.  Same issue with sleep tracking.  Never had problems before but over the last couple of months there are multiple nights a week that it says it can’t give me results because of some issue.  Nothing has changed from before…I wear the band the same way, my internet connection is good.  I’ve even reset the device a couple of times.  Looking to find something new.,.",3
293,"I received this as a gift from my husband and my fitbit flex wouldn't hold a charge anymore. Like the fitbit flex I was already used to not having a screen on my band, which I like the discreteness. I do not know what others were talking about when they said they had trouble charging. I found it very easy to charge. The band is lightweight and very comfortable to wear. I the app is very easy to use. I believe it counts steps pretty accurately. The calorie counter is more accurate than fitbit I believe. The body composition scanner seems spot on.....I'm fat duh! It gives you points as a goal and once you hit that goal it automatically increases that number to keep you striving and progressing. The ONLY drawback that i do not like is it does not have a food log on the app. I am currently using myfitnesspal to log food. It would be nice if they could link up together so I can track my calories in and out without switching between the 2 apps, but it's not a dealbreaker for me. A lot cheaper than a fitbit and worth the money in my opinion. I do not understand the negative reviews. I would at least try it for yourself.",4
294,"Sleep tracking is fairly accurate, though it occasionally off. Caught every time my cat woke me up, but im not sure about how effective the sleep stages is. I have noticed that when the app says I slept well, I generally did.For those complaining about how it fits: I have small wrists and I have no issues. I hate watches and anything on my wrist, but I forget this is even there.For those complaining about battery life and charging: I charge mine maybe once a week. I don't use the tone feature, which helps. And the charger is simple. Button facing out, it is curved to fit perfectly. No reason to have issues here.Privacy issues? Body fat images are accurate whether in underwear, shorts, or even shorts and a tank top or well fitting shirt.I have compared the body fat percentage to a scale and the Navy method. It is slightly higher than the scale but pretty close to the navy method. Higher than I want it to be, but it is accurate.Calories burned is definitely overstated.Overall, this is a great device and I have no complaints worth posting here.",4
295,I wear it every day and I try and get to the 150 points I was actually much better at the beginning than I have now become. Mostly due to being extra busy right now. I’m still not completely convinced that the greenlight won’t eventually cause cancer later down the line but at this point what doesn’t? I love the sleep tracking feature. I personally don’t use the voice recognition.,4
296,"So far this has done everything it said it would. It tracks activity, sleep, tone of voice, and you can do a body scan in the privacy of your home.I like that the app assigns points to encourage you to move more. It also provides labs on everything from sleep to fitness.The tone of voice tool I find useful, but unfortunately it drains the battery completely, which it does state it would do in the product info. With that being said, it gets low points for that.I think the sleep app is completely off. I do have a Fitbit that I wear as well, and find it much more accurate. The Halo only maps out awake time if it's 5 minutes or more, where the Fitbit counts every minute, which I find more accurate as I tend to toss and turn A LOT. My Fitbit will measure I was up over an hour during the course of my sleep, while Halo will say maybe only 20 minutes or so. Based on how I feel getting up, the Fitbit is in my opinion ten times more accurate. Every minute really does add up over the course of a night, so for this Halo gets one star on sleep analysis.The body composition tool is useful and honestly one of the reasons I bought this product. It's very simple to use and is a good motivator.  I find it more accurate than the scales that measure this info and you can do it privately.The device is good, but I find my Fitbit to be better and more accurate.",4
297,"In a world where we are constantly connected through social media, cell phones, etc. I really didn’t want a fitness tracker that had a screen. The halo band is perfect for me in the sense that I forget it’s there. The app is intuitive and allows me to check in when I so desire. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate in the sense that if I don’t feel great in the morning that usually lines up with a poor sleep score, and if I feel rested it usually lines up with a good or better sleep score. As far as HR tracking accuracy goes, I also have a chest strap HR monitor and the halo was within +/- 10 bpm. I’m not a world class athlete so it’s perfectly fine for my purposes. I just found out today that I am able to use the halo with our Peloton bike so that’s an added bonus. The tone feature isn’t something I care to use so I have disabled it. The body scan feature is also something I find useful. I can’t speak to the accuracy for body fat etc., but as a comparison to my past self I find it very helpful. I still need to lose a good amount of weight, but this feature helps me stay motivated when I can visually see the physical changes to my body that may not show up as quickly on the scale.",5
298,I've only had my Halo for a year and a 8 months.  My Halo  Would not connect so I called customer service and they told me it's not under warranty so I would have to buy a new one. Disappointing since it was working great in the beginning.  It's a great concept but unfortunately the lifetime of the band Is not promising.,3
299,"After excitedly getting the go-ahead for early access to Halo, I quickly took advantage of the offer and ordered it immediately. I'm glad I got this at the discounted rate.I actually like so much about this little device! I find the app and sleep tracking, as well as the labs and body analysis, to be fun, and helpful for me.That being said, the biggest problem is wearing the device. The comfort, for me, is just fine. It does sit a bit tight, but I did not notice it. The small profile and light weight did not affect my workouts the way other devices can. However, I've tried fabric and rubber bands. I've taken the watch off for a chunk of time during the day, and I rinse the unit as well as my skin, daily. Unfortunately, I still developed a rash and swelling-- but at one corner of contact, only. It's very odd. I've not had this with other wearables; even when I never bothered to remove them at all, for days on end (that being said, those fit a bit looser and were more rugged in design). Furthermore, if you exercise and sweat, the fabric band is pretty unhygienic and nasty; that's really your ""leisure strap"" only.Sadly, I think I will have to cancel my subscription, and give this piece away. I'm not sure if it's targeted more for people who are just beginning a fitness journey, or whose main focus is on sleep... but the design is certainly not rough and tough for people who are really wanting a device to push themselves to cut that last one or two percentage points of body fat.....maybe if there's a FITHalo with a more rugged, skin friendly design, I'd give this another go?",3
300,"Band Review:1.) Prime Day promo @ $50 is excellent2.) Good tracker for value3.) Syncs easily - out of the box4.) Free membership  / 6 months 👍🏾5.)

Did not use tone recognition but interesting offering9.) Band modular is thick (too large)10.) Wears well though, lightWould recommend ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",4
301,"Update Sept 2021: 1 mos shy of 1yr and it stopped charging. Internal battery can't be replaced.Luckily, Amazon support is awesome  and is replacing the unit at no charge since it was still under warranty.I still use it mostly for Sleep tracking, amd never use the labs. I still pay the 4 bucks per month since it gives me sleep results.Oct 2020I got in early on this so only paid 65 vs 100. I'm still not sure if I would use the labs after my 6 mos trial is up. I turned Tone off due to battery drain and it wasn't very helpful It seemed to only pick up when I was yelling at my dogs, so make it seem like i was angry all the time.I use it mostly for sleep tracking, but not really sure this is the best assessment of my sleep. It has me as deep sleep  when I know for sure I was awake and just reading in bed.The positive is it's comfortable to wear through the night and I don't have to worry about hitting the screen and it vibrating my wrist like my Samsung Active watch does.I sure wish it synced with my Samsung Health app. And my partner wishes is synced with her Apple Health app. Neither of us want to wear or smartwatch to bed since then you have to take it off for a while during the day to charge it back up again. I was hoping the Halo would be the answer to this. I'll probably keep it, but not go with the membership after the 6 mos trial is up. Meanwhile, the search continues for a good sleep option.",3
302,So some of the complaints I see are things that are obvious if people look at the product page or read a little.Of course it doesn't have a screen and I'm ok with that. I didn't want an apple watch otherwise I'd get one. I want SOME distance to tech.You do NOT have to upload naked photos to do the bmi. Shorts are fine. Plus ALL bmi outputs are directional unless you get one done by an actual doctor.It does what it says and I'm ok with that. I do not use any of the programs and things they offer but nice to know it's there.I just use it to track and see my workout performance. I see the sleep score and also keep up with bmi. That's pretty much it. I turned off tone bc it sucks up battery but a nice feature but I am neutral 90% of the time and I agree.Does what it claims. Also I have had zero issues with any skin irritation.,4
303,"I really love this product and honestly don't understand what's with all the bad reviews...It's comfortable to wear, very nicely adjustable, which was huge for me since I'm a petite person and my wrists are really thin. The band is very easy to clean and dries really fast too. I love that it's low key and doesn't have a screen, it's not one of those flashy watches that would make me look like I'm showing off.  I found the user interface very user-friendly, nicely made, clearly a lot of thought went into this product. It's easy to find all your data, and access the Programs that they make available to you to help you work out, sleep better, practice mindfulness, etc. My favorite program is this beautiful calming piano music that I listen to before I fall asleep: it's such a great music, it's also perfect for focusing or daydreaming. The program selection is really wide, I think everyone will be able to find something that they like. The data provided by Halo seems to be pretty accurate to me. I especially like the body fat tracking feature: it really shows the small differences that diet adjustments can make. E.g. for a week I ate a slice of cheesecake a day and at the end Halo showed I put on extra 1% fat: that sounded pretty accurate to me>D The sleep tracking function is very nice too, and helps me wake up in the morning because I'm excited to check my sleep chart. I also enjoy the activity tracking functionality: I walk 40 minutes every day and have no problem exceeding the target 150 points. Even though I'm sitting ~11 hrs a day, so that gives a lot of negative points.  Maybe one thing that could be added is an option to export all your data into csv or something similar: I would love to run some statistics on it, make a couple diagrams to try to find interesting trends and correlations over a long period of time. All in all, I do recommend this product as I enjoy it very much!",5
304,"I have mixed feelings. I love the general idea of it. However, it’s the execution of some things that I’m not a big fan of. For example, I would recommend buying the cover if you’re not getting black. My pink one looks so dirty not and there is no way to wash it. The material picks up dirt so quick and the fact that our hands and wrist attract the most dirt doesn’t help. That is my only concern with the physical product. My other ones are about the app. It tracks accurately but I’m not a fan of how the data is displayed. Heart feature only shows estimated times instead of exact hour and minutes. I wish it kept the same interface but when you scroll over the data it will display the exact time.Then there is the activity display. It gives the option of day, week, and month. Which is great, however tedious if you need to see a certain day or week that is far back. You need to physically press the back arrow until the screen gives you the data you’re looking for. Again I wish I could maybe hold the arrow and a collection of monthly calendars came up and I could select from there. Something like that. Those are my only issues with the app.I understand that most people may not need the specifics. However, for my doctors appointments they would come in handy.They just launched the product so I’m sure we will see many updates in the years to come. Still highly recommend the product.",4
305,"I've had a Fitbit for years and think the Halo is a much better and more comprehensive product. Activity works on a point system where it looks at the quality of your activity and inactivity, not just the amount. You get more points for higher intensity activity and get points taken away for inactivity. I  prefer looking at my health this way instead of just a number of steps, especially when I have to sit at a desk so much. This has actually made me change some of my behaviors - taking breaks, more intense cardio etc. I think one of the best features is the sleep measurement, again measuring quality over quantity. One major flaw. If you happen to doze off watching tv or reading, it starts the clock on your sleep night. So, if you doze off but then get up and do things and fully go to bed later, it looks at this as ""awake"" time after you've gone to bed which it isn't. They need to allow you to record this as two separate sleep events. Other than that one flaw the sleep function is excellent. It comes with a lot of labs to try to improve your sleep habits and quality. I've stopped going to sleep w the TV on after I tried some bedtime story labs which improved my sleep quality significantly. One major flaw - charger is HORRIBLE. It's not well designed - it is really hard to get it to sit just right in the charger. I literally tried for an hour the other day. I went to the help forum and saw hundreds of people having the same issue. I really love the thoughtfulness of this product. It does however need some tweaks. It's not there yet.",3
306,"The band is not bad for what it is. It tracks my workouts, sleep, and heart rate very well. It is minimalist and does not have a screen which I like. I just want it out of the way.The function I was most excited for was the tone reporting. For now it is a gimmick, but eventually I want to see it modified for people with Autism. Both my son and I are autistic, and having something that can detect potential meltdowns before the individual is fully aware would help advert bad situations. Sadly I had to turn off the tone recording as the battery barely made it through the day. If I have to charge it daily I don't feel its worth while (unless the developments mentioned earlier were made). At least for now if I turn it on it will tell me when I am being condescending or excited. But I already know how I feel, so a gimmick.The battery lasts a solid week without tone recording. However a couple months in my battery struggles to charge. Will be contacting support about that. It could just be a problem with my unit.The body scanner is awesome, unless you don't change your body fat percentage. Then it gets monotonous. The band is not needed for the scanning.Sleep reporting is very accurate. However the sleep quality rating is useless. You have to gudge for yourself based on the metrics provided.Without at least two days of battery life for the tone function, I don't think the subscription is worth it. If they could make the band only report heart rate, workouts, and sleep for free, then charge for the AI stuff seperately, I would recomend it.",3
307,"UPDATE:  If you get a band extender (like this one https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079L6CH2G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) then you can wear it on your ankle.  What does this get you?  Steps while on a treadmill which was my only gripe with it.So I got this at the intro price last year, but then my father passed and it sat in the box.  I took it out a month ago because I started Noom and I don't keep my phone on me constantly (not even for steps).  It would be nice if synced with programs other than weight watchers, like Noom which is a pretty popular app.  BUT.  The sleep analysis is great, it definitely picks up when I've gone on a walk, or done something intense.  It charges super quick, and I usually don't have to do so for 10 days or so.  I don't do the tone analysis.  It pays attention to my patterns too, which helps me identify things I could improve upon.  The only other gripe I have, is sometimes it takes a few tries to get it to sync (especially if both the phone and the device are low on battery).  Overall I'm content to keep this one for a while without upgrading right away to the Halo View.",4
308,"I used this band for a few months.I love working out and was really intrigued by this band having the ability to calculate body percentage.  However, I think the tracking system is really disappointing.  Instead of using things like heart rate or calories burned, the Halo uses a weird points system.  With Fitbit, you can use the band to start and end workouts, which is handy because then you know exactly how many calories your activity burned; Halo doesn't do this.  The body fat percentage doesn't seem reliable as it was several percentage points off from a recent caliper test I had done, though I do think reviews saying that you have to be naked are misleading; I took my measurement in a sports bra and shorts, which is near what I work out it anyway.Though the lack of a screen probably makes this band more durable, it can't tell you the time, which is pretty obvious but I know I missed that feature when I bought it.  The band also requires a membership for many features which would make the cost more expensive the longer you have the band; though the price is cheaper, constantly paying for a monthly membership would make it more expensive over time.The 'programs' weren't particularly helpful to me.  I tried some of the sleep ones and saw very little to no change.  These could be useful for others though.I still don't understand the tone of voice feature...TLDR; If you want to use this band for fitness, weight loss, etc, don't buy it.  Get a Fitbit instead.",3
309,"As others have mentioned, the Halo can be extremely demotivating. I have learned to find my own motivation outside the app as I work on getting healthier.The worst part for me is the inaccuracy of the body fat percentage. Maybe it is just because I am a woman (there is also the issue of Halo almost never measuring my tone as 'positive'. Unfortunately with AI, there is often plenty of data for white college-age men to train the algorithm, but little data for the rest of the population), but the app skewed a good 15% higher than my body fat measured or estimated through BMI, measuring tape, and skinfold calipers (alas, I don't have the funds for a DEXA scan or water-displacement scan). It is very discouraging to workout hard and count calories, only for the body fat percentage to skew higher and higher each time. A few online reviews for the Halo noted that the skewed numbers might just be for individuals with low body fat, but as someone with around 31-35% body fat who is just trying to get out of the beginnings of obesity, it is very very discouraging to be visited with 46, 47, and then 49% body fat. I had a breakdown the last time I measured myself using the Halo. Perhaps as someone who deals with regular bloating due to IBS, measuring based on visuals alone was never a good option.I will give the Halo's body scanning a month or two more before ending my subscription, but at this point, I wish I had just bought some calipers and a fitbit for tracking my fitness. Plus, fitbit syncs with myfitnesspal, which would help me track much better.",3
310,"I've worn Fitbit and Samsung. I like how this tracker doesn't have a screen. It is also light on the wrist. It tracks sleep, steps, activity and a variety of other things. I did not use the tone feature. The body photo feature was pretty much in line with my smart scale and is brutally honest. It also analyzed my movements. I really like the labs that give you various suggestions - ton of exercise programs, stress reduction, tips to help you be healthier. Does not have integrated food logging but would love to see that feature especially with whole foods. Overall, Amazon did a surprisingly good job with this sophisticated band and phone app. I think this can only get better. I stopped wearing my Samsung watch and like this much better so far. Never realized how nice it was not to have a screen. Many people have been critical of the band as not motivating in reviews. This band takes a greatest generation mentality - it tells the truth and is earnest. This is not some millennial friendly band that is going to give you a trophy and reward you for being mostly sedentary.  It will deduct points and tell you to move more! We all gotta aim for space like Jeff Bezos. I'm not ready but maybe with the band's guidance, I'll get there... Or at least get healthier in the process.",4
311,"So far I’m disappointed in this. It’s all gung ho on serious exercise and shaming you for inactivity. However, it collects almost no information other than height, weight, age, at setup. If there is a medical condition or anything else, it is never taken into account. There are no slower programs for recovery from injury or surgery,  or initially starting an activity program. The ones that are offered are awesome. I believe more will be offered in the future. They’d be seriously incredible if a PT type of series was included.Then there is the voice tone analysis, an intriguing piece of this app that I’d like to see work better. My female voice is lower and slower than many. It took 6 voice samples at setup and yet I consistently receive feedback of “Discouraged “ “Restrained” and similar low scoring responses. Voice analysis needs to be developed further, I’m willing to wait and see what they come up with.It does measure sleep well for me.To sum up, the app sends me disheartening messages about my supposed inactivity and voice. This has so much potential that I’m really not too worried about the things that don’t work for me right now. But if they’re not starting to be corrected in a reasonable time, well then I’ll be really disappointed.It is not currently matched well to where I’m at in life. If it is expanded to include recovery from injury, slow pokes (!) and voices that are different, then this will be a really incredible product. For now I’ll use it to measure steps, sleep, and heart rate. Good enough.BTW I’m recovering from a spine injury and was hoping this would help with my slow healing progress.",3
312,"I got the halo because my Fitbit kept having issues connecting to my phone, and as I'm trying to track my health and fitness, I found it irritating. I will say, it's a nice little fitness tracker. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:Goodish battery life (more of this on the cons). A single charge can easily last nearly a week.App has a lot of extras in terms of dieting advice and fitness programs to follow, and once the free trial is done, it's only $5 a month. Better than fitbit.Great job at tracking heartrate, steps and sleeping. I wore this side by side my Fitbit for a week and the numbers were pretty similar.The body fat analysis and voice recognition for emotions is handy and, at least the voice, pretty dang accurate.I have had no connection issues with my phone.Cons:When the microphone is on the charge is about a day or less.I wish the app had a way to track food and water intake like fitbit, but who knows. With time maybe they'll add it. I just like having all my fitness stuff in one app.I thought I wouldn't mind not having a screen but I found that to be wrong. I need my watch.I wish there were more band options.Overall I feel the pros far outweigh the cons, especially because my cons are mostly just nitpicking, save the battery life with the microphone on, but overall I love this thing and am very happy with my purchase.",4
313,"First we have to discuss the battery life. It you use the tone monitor, without recording any specific events, the battery lasts one day. Which means sleep tracking suffers because you need to charge it prior to bed.The tone monitor is why I purchased the Halo, but it’s been disappointing. It doesn’t recognize my voice during the workday even when scheduled to do so. It regularly finds my most energetic in the evening when I’m. It speaking to anyone. Lately when I’m out on a walk. I’ve trained to my voice several times. No improvement. It doesn’t like to calendar events as it claims. Nor does the record function offer any usable results. I have recorded difficult convos and it have said I was positive when neutral is others take as well.The band is supposed to be quick dry. Think again. It gets nasty when wet, picking up dirt immediately. It does dry out, quick however is an overstatement. Especially when the trade off is looking gross. The silicone one is wwwway overpriced. Found a generic for $12 that’s great.I’m sad to share that it feels like a beta version that Amazon should have paid me to test not asked me to purchase at this point. Let’s hope they update and offer us early adopters the chance to upgrade or the Halo is destined for the useless tech drawer in my office, next to the original FitBit and gen 1&2 Apple Watch. That reminds me, i wear the Charge 5 also and it’s far superior. I didn’t appreciate it until now.Amazon do you have plan for a reboot and buybacks? Empty promises remind me of the original Apple Watch.",2
314,"10/22/2021 - I'm a week into wearing both my Halo and an Apple Watch (Halo subscription has a few more days left). The Apple Watch is more expensive, but I don't have monthly fees as I do with the Halo -- the AW also offers a ton of other features and is much more intuitive.I will miss the way Amazon Halo tracked my activity -- even if sometimes it made zero sense and didn't track accurately (last week I had a day that I really pushed it and got a meager score from Halo while my AW seemed to give me a more accurate account of calories burned -- still disappointed in that).Halo just doesn't justify a monthly expense - it doesn't offer enough for me pay that. I don't want it to monitor my voice and tone, I don't want it to take pictures of my body... I don't use these intrusive functions.---UPDATE 04/20/2021 - the headaches with the Halo get worse and worse. Now, along with strap issues the Halo isn't tracking accurately.The one strong feature I loved with this fitness band now doesn't work. For some reason the hour plus bike rides I've taken the last few days are registering less than 30 minutes.  My 65 minute bike ride today that worked up a healthy sweat - registered 28 minutes and 13 points on my Halo. This should've been a 40-50 point ride.... and now it ranks less than a casual walk?The band itself continues to be poorly made and poorly thought out. I am so disappointed in the quality of what should be a simple strap to hold the Halo onto my wrist.AMAZON: PLEASE FIX THIS! PLEASE GIVE US SOME SORT OF TECH SUPPORT!----I already stare at too many screens - phone, tablet, TV, monitor - I didn't want yet another screen and a distraction on my wrist. The Amazon Halo seemed perfect -- although some of the options had zero appeal to me.After a couple weeks - this thing starts to smell. It's annoying -- no matter how many times I wash it, the stink comes back in a day or so. At this point, it's more trouble than it's worth -- as the washing is starting to make the velcro fail.I haven't used the BMI or tone features as I have no interest in them. I just want to track my activity, sleep and heart rate. I'm not sure how accurate it is that -- there is little breakdown or detail about any of that.  You can't zoom in and figure out when you've worked the hardest during a workout - and just because I might fall asleep in front of the TV a little bit doesn't mean my actual sleep for the night has started (causing a ""sleep disturbance.""...and after 6 months they want me to pay monthly for features I don't want or use and for a couple features that are poorly executed and don't work properly? I'll pass.The Amazon Halo is a great idea - that just ends up failing. Perhaps with time it will improve, but I suspect by the time that happens I'll have moved on to a different product that works and doesn't charge a monthly fee.",1
315,"I have not tried the voice feature so will not speak to that.The major problem I have is that it is so uncomfortable to wear. I cannot sleep with it on. I work at home from a laptop and the device sits on the underside of the wrist, so it's not even comfortable to wear while working. I have to take it off whenever I think it may get wet. Otherwise, the fabric is itchy on my skin. Overall, I only wear the device for a few hours a day (if I remember to put it on).The other features like step tracking, heart rate monitoring, labs, health suggestions, etc. are all really cool and I feel they are accurate and work well.--------UPDATE Aug 2021--------I received the device in November of 2020. After my initial review, I was contacted by an Amazon employee and told about their more comfortable band option. The sports band is definitely more comfortable and has enabled me to wear the band daily, for a majority of the day. It is still very uncomfortable when wet (from shower or sweat) and when I am sleeping.Recently, I have been having issues with the band syncing... It will only sync when on the charger (even if band is fully charged). Even once on the charger, I have to get it to sync multiple times before it fully syncs. Often times the first sync will only add a few points, then the second sync will add the remainder activity and points. Most recently, when it ""syncs"" it has not been adding any points. I have to sync 4-5 times before it add something and even then, I know that it is not my true number. Example, I will go on a 30 minute run and it will only give me 5-10 points.It is not secure.  I have had this device literally fly off of my wrist during workouts and dancing.. Not fun having to scramble around and locate the pieces. It also causes a disturbance during dance class when it flies across the room and I go running after it. Due to it flying off, I often times remove it during workouts and class which is annoying because when I add a log to the app I know I am not receiving the correct amount of ""points"".I am still giving it 2 stars because I do enjoy the movement feature to help with mobility and strength. But I did order a different tracking device from Garmin and am excited to use that. Unfortunately, I think it is time to retire my Halo. It does not work for an active lifestyle.",2
316,"Have had this about a week and it has been a source of aggravation since. I mainly wanted and sleep tracker and a way to monitor my heart rate working out. Forget about the other junk,e.g., don't care about diets or how I sound to others. I have tried to be patient, but when I way over target heart rate, it should not read 76 bpm. And that's if it even detects a beat at all. Very sketchy and unreliable. And if actually slept the way this thing tracks, or for 2 nights it didn't, I'd be dead. No way. 👎 I am so completely disappointed. Wondered if my wrist tattoo was somehow affecting it. Nope. Did same on right wrist. It's essentially a nuisance and can't say much else about it. Have worn it a week, only remove to shower, and that's when I charge it, so hoping I can return it and maybe get a whoop. My daughter loves hers",2
317,"I use this for only a few things, not very interested in changing my entire life based on what some metal and plastic tell me I should do(which involve spending more money, no thanks!), while barely managing to work in some aspects. Not very trustworthy as a whole.Heartbeat monitor? Great. But that's not hard to accomplish.Sleep Tracker? Doesn't even work, not one bit, after troubleshooting and following guides.Tone tracking? Sure, it's fine.General UI & Ease of Use? Terribly designed. Everything is hidden behind several button presses & scrolling while everything could easily be available right at the front screen. It's easier for me to begin using parts of the app I have no interest in than find a chart of my heartbeat throughout the day.",2
318,"The sleep tracker is pretty spot on. I wake regularly throughout the night and have many nights where I am up for a while, and this seems to track that correctly. It has been very enlightening for me, as I found I’m  only getting on average 6 hours of sleep.The steps and activity tracker is not as accurate. I always get a huge kick out of the results on days I’m riding on the back of my husband’s motorcycle. I get over 100 points for intense activity! Haha.The tone tracker is kinda fun. I like to look back at the end of the day and see what my overall portrayed mood was for the day. I can definitely tell when I have a bad day.There are so many great features to this little tracker. I definitely haven’t used it to it’s full potential. Overall I really like it. I wear it daily. I like that the band is easily removable so I can hand wash it. I also like the band is one size fits most. I have a large wrist and this fits with plenty of room too. I do wish they had a bigger selection of bands.",4
319,"First off - I LOVE THE HALO. It's shown me what I need to work on in terms of my fitness and cardiovascular health. (And sleep.)Made many positive life changes because I'm finally face to face with reality. No longer do I have to wonder 'What's my weight?' Because that's not the question Halo wants you to ask yourself.The Halo's main concern is fat percentage.  I went from having *34% (not good) to 28% (heart healthy)  thanks to the Halo and the daily fitness routines, weekly check ins (I took a body scan every week, it suggest every two weeks), and sleep improvements.THIS IS BASED ON SCIENCE. SCIENCE. HALO WORKS ON SCIENCE. Science doesn't care about ego, science just wants you not to die!It irks me how people are giving the Halo a bad review because they don't like that it's telling them their body fat percentage is too high. 'I weigh 210 pounds and it's saying I weigh too much'. No, you weigh 210 pounds have have a high body fat percentage. Halo is trying to keep us from having a heart attackAnyways, I look better, feel better, and have more energy. Halo guided me to take the steps needed to make positive changes and offered REAL HELPFUL suggestions on how to do that. Gained muscle, loss fat, feel good. Thanks Halo for keeping me from staying out of heart attack range. If you ignore Halo or mad that your body fat percentage is too high, then that's not the fault of the device. It's doing EXACTLY what you purchased it for. I didn't purchase this device to make me feel better, I purchased this device so I can cut my odds of DYING to a heart condition.Lost about 10 pounds following Halo guidelines. It works if you are willing to follow the programs, and stop being hung up about how you look. Focus on your heart that's inside of you.*((Added note, I'm a woman so the ranges are different from men and women! Woman have more body fat than men.))",5
320,"What a let down. Wore simultaneously with my other sleep and step tracker. Sometimes tracked more steps, sometimes less. Had it been consistently more than I could say it's accurate as I feel the other tracker doesn't catch all my steps. But this would track even less quite often.Does not seem accurate for middle of the night bathroom trips. I know I wasn't up for an hour and 14 minutes to use the bathroom!I was intrigued by the ""tone tracker"". It's not worth a darn. You can have a 15 minute conversation that is lively and upbeat and it doesn't register anything. But then in a 5 minute conversation it will say you had 1 2.5 second phrase that sounded...shy, disinterested, dismissive, sad, or stern. Really? What phrase was that? It doesn't tell you! I wasn't sad, or disinterested, or any of the negative things it will point out. I can't remember every word I said, and it doesn't share what it honed in on. If I had a goal to sound more positive and happy this would not be a useful tool to get me there. It has picked up on happy, content, and positive aspects in similar conversations but that's rare. It only seems to want to point out what it thinks was negative. I'm a layed back happy person with a bold sense of humor who often ""cracks up"" those around me, a cancer survivor with a great appreciation that I'm alive and kicking. But according to the tracking, I'm a sad, shy person.It also needs manually synched a lot. I understand that's to help save the battery time but even for easy going me, I found it somewhat frustrating. A person living a fast paced life with a high pressure job that doesn't want to have to manually sync it every time they go to the app would probably hate it. If you could sync it by tapping something on the app it would be better.It probably works great for practicing speeches as it has a bookmark feature to do that. But I have no speeches to rehearse.I don't find the body image useful. I can take a selfie. Once it takes the images, which was not an easy process, it only gives you a front and back model. My belly fat is my issue, but it doesn't offer a side view. It also rates my body fat a lot higher than my BMI. My actual BMI is 27.8, this tracker rates me at a whopping 40.2! Yes, I need to lose about 15 pounds and tone up the tummy. But I get the feeling I'd be a bag of bones by the time this thing would approve of my body fat. And with no side view image, I'll just take selfies.Certainly isn't for those with a low self esteem or poor self image. You'd probably hang yourself in a week.I don't hate it. But I find it useless. Returning. And I only have one option for an actual free return. That was kinda disappointing too. But it's only about a mile and a half out of my way so it is was it is. Is worth a short trek out of my way to get my hard earned money back.",1
321,"I wanted to like it. The only reason I keep it is because it attaches to my WW. It is so uncomfortable my wrist hurts. I also do not like that you have to pay for features. Other products (samsung)the features are free . So I give it a 3 though a 2 would fit better, but it tracks on my WW. I wouldn't buy it again if this one breaks. Maybe something more comfortable, and more included features next time.",3
322,"I love this! But after a week of wearing it while I was traveling on vacation I took it off because my arm felt irritated and I found my arm red and blistered under it. It had taken a month for the blisters to heal and I still can see the outline of where it sat on my arm. But I love the sleep tracking, it was spot on, literally to the second when I would wake at night and check my clock. Really nice product, but the burn on my arm was not pleasant.",4
323,"I call my Halo ""Jiminy Cricket"" because it is a reminder that I am not getting enough sleep or exercise.  I like it because now I understand why, when I think I have had enough sleep, that I haven't been sleeping efficiently.  It seems to be fairly accurate about the time I actually fall asleep and which stages of sleep I am in during the night.  I like the explanations on the app about the stages of sleep and what constitutes good sleep.  I don't really like the activity tracker very much, because I mostly exercise on my recumbent bike and the elliptical.  The Halo doesn't seem to recognize when I am using the bike.  The one important feature of the activity tracker is that it takes points away when I sit too long,  I wish there was a way for it to remind me to get up and move.  I am not convinced that the Tone function is worth it because the battery wears down faster and I seldom have anyone at home to talk to during the day so I don't turn it on.  There are some good health hints that I can watch little videos to give me ideas about how to be more healthy.  Overall, it works well enough for my needs and I got it on a good sale, so I will keep using it because I want to be more active and healthy.  It gives me goals to work toward.",4
324,"I've had a dozen or so trackers, and I don't like wearing a watch or anything bulky on my arm.  I liked the Fitbit Alto, and honestly I really like the size/weight of the Halo.  Not having a screen has not been an issue for me at all.Fitness tracking is pretty good, but you can wave your arm around and get steps.  I like doing an activity every now and then, my daughter really likes them.My whole family got them, and our biggest interest was in the Tone analysis.  We seen to have issues in how we talk to each other, and we really hoped that the tone analysis would help us see things instead of being told by others and snapping back.I'm not impressed... Actually, I'm pretty disappointed.  ""Neutral 85% / Total: 3min 57s""  So for the entire time I was awake (about 16 hours) it gave me input on 5 min?!  Why the hell does it kill the battery so much if it's only analyzing a few minutes every day?!Unless you use the ""Live"" analysis you aren't getting any decent feedback.  Based on complaints about privacy and battery usage, this is not at all what I expected.You know what would be an awesome feature?  If it listened to you all the time, and when it detected you being mad or something, it would make the band vibrate.  That would be huge in helping people break their habit of talking badly to people.",3
325,"Pretty interesting device, but definitely not worth the full $100 MSRP.  I think some of the features are neat, the body scan, and some are gimmicks, tone analysis.  Overall, it's a really good first effort from Amazon, just fell short for me in a couple of areas.Likes- Body Scan.  I haven't see anyone else offer this, and I really like it as an alternative to depending on my home scale to calculate body fat.Dislikes- Tone Analysis misses a lot of my conversations because I use a headset for meetings.  It seems really conversation dependent where it can hear both people, at least in my experience.- Battery Life.  For a screen-less device it sure doesn't last long.  Was expecting something closer to a week and instead seeing 2 to 4 days.  Might turn off the tone analysis altogether to improve this.Mehs- Fit/Comfort.  If you've worn anything made by Fitbit in the last decade, you already know how this will fit.  The profile and weight reminded me a lot of a Fitbit Charge.  It's not bad, but definitely not better.- Accuracy.  Nothing here seemed quite right, and I think it's why they push a lot of Points.  Nothing wrong with a point system, and I'd never take medical advice from a $100 electronic, but sometimes it feels like it's more of an estimate than fact.  It measured my body fat at 29% where my home scale said 19%. Yesterday my halo band said I burned 2,600 calories with 16,540 steps, my Oura ring said 3,164 calories with only 14,820 steps.  Not trying to prove that it's wrong, but it's definitely more conservative numbers than any other tracker I've used.ConclusionNot really sure this is needed.  The best feature in my opinion, Body Scan, is something they could offer without selling a band. And even though I got the device on a ""flash sale"", it doesn't feel like a bargain.  I think it gives an interesting insight to a lot of metrics, but nothing felt like it was 100% accurate either.  Overall, would not purchase again nor would I consider a new version without some major revisions.",2
326,"I really like this band! Not perfect, but has some great features. First, the BMI calculation feel way more accurate than what I’ve gotten elsewhere. Others will say I’m in a healthy range but I’m realllly not when I read the descriptions and see what someone I’m that range typically looks like.The sleep tracking has been incredibly helpful. I don’t give myself enough time, usually, and it got to a point in March where I was reading the data and decided I really needed to make sleep a priority. I’m not quite where I want to be yet but I feel so much better.Tone is awesome, too! My husband always comments on my tone and I don’t always hear it. It’s good to have a snap shot off my day so I’m more aware. I’ve used it during presentations to help improve when I got some feedback that I didn’t sound confident.Activity tracks for me pretty well and I haven’t had any issues there. I actually love that it doesn’t have a screen. I’ve got ADHD and the fewer distractions, the better. My Apple Watch drives me crazy when I’m trying to get work done and I’ve tried several things to try and make that better. The halo I don’t have to fuss with at all.I wish it connected with Apple Health and my Peloton, but overall, I like it.",4
327,"I have had my Halo since the initial launch.There was a bit of difficulty at FIRST but after using it for some time now, it has become WAY more manageable. READING THE INSTUCTIONS is vital to understanding your device.The fact that there is no screen does NOT bother me because I feel that it would be a HUGE distraction for me. IF I wanted a device with a screen, I'd have bought one. I appreciate the lack of distraction. I barely notice it on my wrist and so I go about my day and tend to go to my app at the end of the day.I have and continue use the workout programs coupled with working out 5x a week in the morning and have lost inches. I recently was able to wear a bustier I bought about 15yrs ago as part of a GOAL outfit. I couldn't even  CLOSE my bustier a month ago. I closed it with a lil struggle (as it IS a bustier...LoL) but STILL managed to zip it closed and breathe...LoL..while out on a Girl's Trip EATING. If anyone knows about putting clothes on with NO stretch, You all know that eating is an almost no go. LoL.I was and am able to monitor my exercise regime, steps, movement, heartrate, sleep patterns (which I was able to report to my Drs to make improvements where needed) and how I may sound to others, especially if I do not notice it.There is SO much you can do with this device if you actually take advantage of all that it offers.I am SO happy I bought it.I am looking to get another ,or 3, for my children. It is definitely an investment into my...our...health.I VERY much recommend.**ALSO...I had an issue where my initial device just stopped working. It wouldn't charge and therefore wouldn't turn on. Amazon QUICKLY responded and replaced my device with zero charge to me. THANK YOU AMAZON!!**",5
328,"I've been using the Amazon Halo almost constantly for 2 months.  This is my first fitness tracker and there are aspects I like about it but it hasn't delivered on the biggest draws.The good: I really like the lab feature.  I just finished 4 weeks of high intensity strength training and feel great.  I like that it tracks my movement throughout the day (usually pretty accurate) and estimates calories burned.The bad: the tone feature is kind of useless.  That was one of the features I was most interested in but it tends to be vague and can show polar opposite attitudes within minutes of each other.  It's also just hard to remember the context of what you were saying and who you were talking to at 3:27 that afternoon.  The sleep function is also kind of cool but it's not the most accurate.  It will often say I was sleeping (including deep sleep) while I was working at my computer at night.The ugly: the body scan feature!  This is probably the most important feature if you are considering the Halo and it has never worked properly for me.  My first couple of scans had me as high as 32%!  It finally came down to 28% (not due to any body changes) which seemed within the realm of possibility.  Then I got into a fitness routine and after a couple weeks got a 27% scan.  I was excited, even if the number was wrong it was at least showing progress.  This morning was the final straw.  I am visibly more toned.  I stayed the same weight but lost an inch off my waist since my last scan and my percentage went up to 28.7%!  For reference according to the U.S. Navy calculator based on height, weight, and body measurements I am 20.2%.  BMI alone puts me at 27%.The app crashes often and has many delays.  Getting it to take a scan can literally take 30 minutes.  It crashes every time I try to look at scan results and I have never seen a 3D model of myself.  I have sent the crash info back several times and it hasn't been fixed.  It has had crashes and delays occasionally during the lab videos but that has improved.Conclusion: there may be better bands and apps out there.  If you are interested in the tone and scan features I wouldn't bother.  I will keep using it for the fitness labs and to track my heart rate throughout the day.  Hopefully the app will get better.",2
329,After having the Fitbit I decided that a screen is good to have!  I stopped wearing it after the free trial ended.  I would prefer an item that is a one-time purchase instead of paying monthly for a subscription.,3
330,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The app works wonderfully, the halo band was a game changer for my sleep. It encourages me to exercise more. BUT the charger stopped working in less than 2 months. I called the Halo Support, was waiting in the line almost one our. I bought 2 new generic chargers.",3
331,"Let me start by saying that I got this on a deal last year while it was still in Beta Testing.I recently pulled all my data from it and did a data mining project and found some pretty interesting trends about my personal exercise and sleep habits.I don't find it uncomfortable to wear but I have not been a watch wearer for many years. I think that it is possible that if I did normally wear a watch, I might find it awkward to wear on an opposite wrist or same wrist but with no watch face. As is, it is more like a bracelet than a watch to me. It requires a charge only once a week or so (as long as the voice feature is turned off).I like that I can keep track of my heartrate at any given moment as well as average heartrate.I walk on average 20000 steps per day and easily hit the minimum recommended 150 heart points so I set it to the next level up and usually surpass that. I should mention that I have some medical issues and while I'm working to get back into shape and am fairly active, I am not an athlete.I particularly like that it tracks your quality of sleep and how much time you have spent in each portion of the sleep cycle. It is nice to be able to see what has gone wrong on a day when it just feels like you haven't slept at all.Finally, I like that all the data can be easily compiled as a .csv file so that it can be organized, sorted and studied.I think that for the price, it can't be beat.",5
332,"As a health tracker it's pretty good as a fitness tracker there are a lot better available. I got it because I wanted the feature that listened to my tone of voice to give feedback on how I sound to others. I ended up turning this feature off because (1) it drained the battery to the point that it couldn't go 24 hours without a charge and (2) It didn't give me any feedback that was useful. It would tell me that I sounded annoyed at 2:15. Getting that information when I sync the band hours later doesn't help me. The body scan is kinda weird and its accuracy is in doubt. The movement tracking is good. It encourages you to move and not sit too long. I very much like the sleep tracking and will be keeping it because of that. I've just dipped into the labs that come with app. The sleep labs so far have been 50/50. Sometimes the voice or sound is soothing sometimes it's so annoying it keeps me awake. These labs play on your phone. It would be nice if the band could communicate with the Echo, but so far it does not. The fabric band that came with it irritated my wrist. I bought the sport band which is very comfortable and easy to put on. I'm not sure I want to pay the monthly fee once my 6 months are up since I really only use a couple of the features of the band.Would I buy it today knowing what I know about it now? No.",3
333,"So I really wanted to like the Halo. The tone seemed fun and so did the body composition. Plus the fitness tracker seemed like a easy goal to make. But the whole thing fell flat.First off, I'm 5'7"" and 118lbs. I'm small. And this body composition thing says I'm 27.1% fat. I've tried doing the labs (their programs) for fat loss and tried weight building exercises. I've lost 4 pounds in 4 weeks and my body composition is still 26.7% fat.Which is on the high end of normal.  I wonder if my tattoos throw off my body image? Compared to the other forms of fat composition (trifold pinch test and multiple body composition scales) the Halo just seems wrong. The others say I'm 18-20%.The sleep tracker.I don't know if they can make this thing learn, but it is dumb. It says it only tracks disturbances that are longer than 5 minutes. But I will literally be laying there for hours and it still thinks I'm sleeping. Maybe it has to do with resting heart rate. I've never used another sleep tracker but it gives me great sleep scores when I have crappy sleep nights. And when I sleep irregular hours (night shift worker) it really fails to see how well I sleep. I've stopped using the feature all together.Tone. It's cool and all but it turns out, it doesn't know when you're fake being nice or when you are actually being nice. Drains your battery. Fun for a week then it's just meh.Activity tracker. I kinda like this. You get points based off your activity and you have a weekly goal. There are definitely some bugs because it thinks I'm sedentary when I work 14 hours and never even sit down. It only will track the steps and count standing as sedentary time. And sedentary time is negative points. So if they can make it tell the difference between standing and sitting in their program, that would make this part super cool. Otherwise the points are fun. I try and beat my points whenever I get the chance.I do like it's small design. It would work better for someone a little bigger than me. The actual device is larger than my wrist. The size difference only effects the band length. Maybe in the future they will make the physical device smaller.The labs seem helpful. They are just workout programs and diet programs. I'm sure as they expand their product, more exciting things will come.At this point, I don't think I'll be paying to continue the service. I'll use my 6 months included in my original purchase and then just use the base features.",2
334,"I really wanted to like this. Tried really hard to like this. I cant. The subscription service is great for the body scans and exercises but the hardware is just ineffective, and annoying to use.Bright spots:-great app with awesome body scans. If there were some way to retain the membership for the scans without the band I would be on board, but this is a nice supplement to something like Fitbit, Apple Watch or Whoop, not at all a replacement-Removeable, washable band.Low Spots:-No Screen along with a completely janky user interface - use this one button with all sorts of complicated touch patterns to control/pair/and reset your completely unreliable bluetooth device. Is it working now? who the hell knows. did it catch that activity? I guess I will find out later. Is it even charged right now? Most likely no.-unreliable. Frequently loses bluetooth connection to my phone and has to be factory reset and go through the whole annoying ""User Interface"" which is again a single button with no visual, auditory, or haptic feedback and a complicated pattern of button-press commands-minimal accuracy. I wore both my fitbit and halo for the first two months and fitbit was in every instance more accurate to a hand-timed HR count than the halo.-really annoying charger and again, lack of interface, give you almost no feedback in trying to get it settled accurately on a really bad charger. It doesnt sit easily in a place where the charging pins can make contact with the device so it rarely charges correctly when left in the charging clip",3
335,"Overall it’s a really cool tracker. The sleep tracking is particularly my favorite. It seems pretty accurate and I like that it shows your trend overnight. Meaning, it shows you on a timeline when you fell asleep and how long it took, then it shows REM, light sleep and deep sleep. The body scan is pretty cool also but I don’t use that as much. The other thing I got it for was to track your tone of voice which is so cool and there’s not anything out there at least that I’ve heard of that does that. I really do like it and I like to sit down at the end of the night and see how my day went but I will say when you choose to use it, it drains your battery faster. That’s the only Collin I have about this. Besides the fact that it is pretty uncomfortable to wear after a long period of time which is the whole point of it. It has an odd little shape to it where it sits almost on my wrist bone and it’s kind of painful. To stop this from happening, I have to adjust it several times a day. It’s not as my Apple Watch that sits on my other wrist and I forget I’m wearing it it’s so comfortable. Other than those two cons it’s really awesome so I can’t quite give it five stars but four stars is still pretty good to me",4
336,"I tried the Halo because I had previously had a Fitbit Versa and while it did what I kinda wanted it to, it felt too clunky and like a waste of a product - and something else that I'll get to. When I heard about the halo, I wanted to check it out as it seemed like a pared down version, almost similar to earlier Fitbits. Overall, it does the job it says it's going to do. I didn't turn on the sound/voice conversations at first but when I did, the battery drained significantly faster. I turned it off as I soon realized I wasn't seeing anybody worthy of analyzing a conversation with (thanks 2020!) and my battery life returned to normal. The app overall felt clunky and was either way too invested in my data or didn't even bother to capture anything - there was no in between. It tracked my activity, tracked my sleep fairly accurately (with a crying infant, it was very scattered and unpredictable sometimes), so it wasn't the worst ever. However, the main reason I stopped using it is the same reason I had to stop using the Fitbit Versa - it was beginning to burn me. I don't know what it was or why it happens, twice now with 2 different products, but the sensors irritated my skin and kept leaving scabs or red areas. I decided to not see how bad it got this time (the burn/scab from the Versa has left a scar on my wrist) so it now sits in my desk taking up space.It's a good tool for doing what it does, but I probably won't be looking to use it again.",3
337,"This is a multi-purpose tool. It measures and assesses activity, sleep quality, and tone of the conversation, not the timbre of one's voice, and maybe some other things. I have several devices that measure and assess activity. I have a Sleep Number bed that provides data RE sleep patterns and data.  I have a lot of ortho issues that degrade my sleep quality per Sleep #. My primary reason for purchase was to cross-validate the bed's data.  The first 2-3 nights it registered nothing. support link said maybe too much movement. I do sleep fairly poorly and toss and turn. It finally started measuring me a bit, but its data only showed me getting less than 2 hours sleep during 6 + hours in bed. I trusted it's data even less than the bed's.  The product is not a watch. I'm a mid-boomer; I'm a watch person. Many younger people are not. For me to use I would have to become that guy wearing 2 devices and I don't want to be that guy. I planned to use it as a nighttime and at-home device only.  I am not slamming the device; many will find it useful, but I was not one. I returned the device since it did not offer any usable new functionality for me. As for the judgemental part, I'm a little too sleepy to care about its assessments. But if your looking to improve your woke creds, you'll probably be okay. Peace out!",3
338,At first I liked the band and the tone part of the app however the tone stopped working and wouldn’t pick up my voice unless I press live on the app which is annoying. I accidentally unpaired my band from Bluetooth while I was traveling and then was unable to pair it back to Bluetooth because I didn’t have the charger so that did not come in handy as I hoped it would during my travels. I may end up returning this based on the fact that it’s not easy to reconnect it when life happens.,3
339,"I really liked the idea of this watch and it’s a very nice program. I had nothing to compare the accuracy to, that’s why I gave it three stars. Charging was great for a while and then one day it just stopped charging and connecting to Bluetooth. I left it charge overnight and woke up to nothing charged. Did some research and I had to delete my profile and start over. That happened twice. I loved the sleep tracker a lot. I sleep poorly, the sleep tracker made me want to improve that, which it did. I pretty much loved halo, but I couldn’t get over one little basic thing. The band!!!! I wore a small and no matter how loose i had it on my wrist it seemed to get tighter. I hated sleeping with it at night. I’d loosen it up and wake up to it higher up my wrist. The hardness of the sensor annoyed me. Not a ton but I feel like it could be more curved. I think with people reporting the strengths and areas of improvements, it will improve. I would choose Halo and Fitbit over Apple Watch any day. Number one reason I won’t ever buy an Apple Watch is because it’s too much of an iPhone. Had the Apple Watch just tracked fitness, I would definitely consider it. O and charging process for the Halo needs to improve. The app is very nice, Amazon did a great job on that. I had the watch for almost a month and just couldn’t get past that dang band raising up my arm. Give it a try though, you may like it.",3
340,"I got this during the release promotion and I'm still not sure it was worth the discounted price.  Don't get me wrong, it has some cool features, although some seem more novelty than useful.  The voice tone analyzing is neat, but I'm not sure why I should care about it.  Same goes for the sleep temperature - interesting, but not sure why it's useful to me.The sleep tracking is one of the best in the industry I think, which I like because I don't sleep well as a rule.The body scanning is also pretty awesome.The step and activity tracking is accurate as well, but the feature set falls off hard here because it doesn't sync with any of the most popular tracking apps.  The only ones it syncs to are Weight Watchers and John Hancock, and no offense to those that use them, but these tend to be for the less connected, ""boomer"" market.  A lot of us have YEARS of data saved up in Google Fit, MyFitnessPal or Apple Health, and to not be able to merge with those (especially MFP, which is NOT direct competition) seems like a huge mistake.By the time my free subscription is up, if either Google Fit or MFP is not supported, I don't think I can continue with the subscription.It's a good device, and will probably be great for the very small market they seem to be going for, but for those of us already invested elsewhere, we will still need a second device to do everything we need.",3
341,"Let me say first I wanted to love this but overall I just like it.It has some flaws.One being the halo itself. Using it for sleeping in the beginning is extremely uncomfortable, so much my wrist was in pain several times. I eventually got through the pain and used it to track my sleep. The app makes the features user friendly and it was neat to see when I slept well and woke up.All in all the design is not that comfortable.The voice recognition is great, but I barley turn it on as it eats battery. It's a cool feature when I want to track my tone though.I love that I can shower with it and wash dishes, I don't have to worry about it with my daily life.I like the body scan and seeing my progress. I don't really use any of the mobile app features with workouts and such. I tried but just didn't really care for it. The activity tracker is good but it annoys me when I know I busted my butt and it doesn't recognize it and gives me little points.Being an Amazon product it would have been great to have Alexa on it, especially since it doesn't have a screen.Also note if you purchase a new phone all your progress on your old phone is deleted when you add the halo app to your new phone. Super disappointed about it.",4
342,"I’m lucky I got it for a deal during Amazon Prime Days or I would return it.Pros: it’s lightweight and I like that I don’t have a screen to look at. I can ignore it and then later check my app for information.I like that it tracks my workouts by intensity. I knows when I do lighter activity versus intense workouts. The charger is easy to set up and I can shower with it on. You can get recipes and whatnot if you like that kind of thing. I like that it took my bmi and then gave me exercises to help.Cons: it pretty much requires a monthly subscription, it only tracks your sleep at night and does not include daily naps. The tone section is a little dumb. It will tell me when I’ve used a phrase etc that sounds stubborn, happy, frustrated, etc.. the problem is I don’t remember what I was doing during that 15 seconds from 5 hours ago. If I wear the tracker all day and then take it off to charge yet haven’t looked at the app, it loses my data. I son all day at work, got home, had to charge it then it didn’t show any tone etc. for the day.The battery only lasts a day or two and has to be charged again.For its price range I would rather buy something else that doesn’t require a monthly subscription. Of course you can us it without the monthly fee but your data is even more restricted.",2
343,"Tone tracker. That's the main reason I got the device. What I don't like is you can't review the snippets so you learn when you come across with a harsh tone. The indicators are good, but without hearing what was said and the actual voice tone you really don't learn how to correct.Sleep tracker - I wake at 430 am every day. Because of this I nap during the day. Other devices I use track all sleep data not just preset times determined by the device creator. They quickly added feature that tracks sleep for those that perform shifts. Sadly again it's preset time frames.Activity. I know I don't exercise, but according to the device I'm dead. Other devices track steps and more encouragement to perform more steps.Design - not a fan. The clap to charge I always had to double check to make sure the device was secure in the clamp and press down hard before the device registered it was charging. I agree with other reviewers. The device had to have such a snug fit that it left imprints on my arm and my arm would be sore.The mobile app was easy to understand. It was great that it had links to videos to assist with working out.Honestly they only thing this device has going for it that others do not is the tone tracker and like I said without being able to listen to the snips so you can learn how to improve your time by recognizing how you sound or word choice it's really a useless feature.",3
344,"I really want to like this product as it's everything I'm looking for in a health tracker: simple design, unobtrusive, and focused on it's core purpose... health. This little device is well on its way to becoming a great tracker, but it still has a long way to go.Pros:+ Long Battery Life (when Tone is disabled)+ Comfortable+ Well designed app with (mostly) intuitive health dashboard and stats+ Feature set matches my specific needs (HR Monitor, sleep tracking, activity tracking)+ Value for price was excellent with the early access promotional discount+ BMI tracking is fascinating enough to make up for it's slight creepinessCons (based on my experience with my device):- HR Live Mode accuracy is inconsistent or significantly delayed - verified both manually and in comparison to other real-time HR monitors- Activity Tracking inconsistency (e.g., 3 points during intense 30 min HIIT exercise, 28 points during casual 30 min dinner prep)- Sleep Tracking has difficulty identifying non-standard sleeping behavior (e.g., long times to fall asleep, extended periods of being awake in the middle of a sleep session)- Total Calorie Expenditures uses a combination of BMR (Basil Metabolic Rate) and the HR monitor and appears extremely inflated (e.g., current estimates average 4700 calories daily)Assuming the HR monitor issues are not hardware related, I'm excited to see how this device progresses in the coming months.Feature Request: Product team, if you're reading this, would love to see a habit tracking feature tied to the band (e.g., double-press the halo button to log the occurrence of an activity or event that I can monitor on the app)",3
345,"Editing review as I go:  Right away, I wish it had a digital face for steps, heart rate, goals...a clock, at least, so I didn’t have to wear more than one band.  I also wish it were capable of switching bands to different ones.  As far as I can tell, you are stuck with the band you choose at purchasing. (UPDATE 1/10/21: You can switch out the bands! Turns out I wasn’t pulling hard enough to pop the unit off the band, in fear of breaking it, lol.)Not sure that it’s that great at tracking sleep.  I am a horrible sleeper who tosses all night.  I wake up in pain and I shift to the opposite side and sleep on that side until I wake up in pain again.  This thing tells me that I had the best night ever every night.  But then again, I’m not a sleep doctor {shrug}.I also wish it had a haptic that could vibrate in the following ways:1) a silent alarm to wake up to2) as a reminder to get up and move around when activated3) a silent helper that goes off if your heart rate jumps up while being sedentary.  This might be a pipe dream, but I have severe panic attacks and the HRM actually recorded one of mine.  It would be nice to have a vibration that goes off at spike moments to, maybe, get your attention to remove yourself from...whatever...to decompress. (Okay, laugh at me if you like...)",3
346,"Been using the Halo band for two months. My son loves his, and I got in on the early purchase. I also have an apple watch 5 and a fitbit inspire 2.Pros:—sleep tracking. I love this feature and it’s easier to use than the other devices.— tone. Even though it uses more battery, I love this. It’s interesting to see, esp real time.Cons:—-uncomfortable. I’d love an elastic band to see if that helps. Cant find one.—- i prefer devices with screens. Thought I wouldn’t mind not having one, I do. This will be a pro for some people.—- won’t use the body fat feature. Again, this will be a pro for some.—- point system needs refining, or a setting for people not able to be constantly active. I end every day with no points because I am disabled. But tracking activity makes me be as active as I can. However, ending with 0 points daily is discouraging.—- it appears that if you stop the subscription the halo band bricks. This is rather - unfortunate.At the end of 6 months i will likely give it away. I don’t see paying monthly for services i get free on other devices i have.Also, unless Amazon makes a “low activity” setting for disabled, elderly, or ill people,  it doesn’t meet my needs.",4
347,"I really like the body scan feature & the nutrition plans offered. The daily activity goals keep me motivated & make me try to get up and walk around.The only really negative experience I've had is with the app itself. I've had this for 2 weeks now, and twice the app has completely deleted my information so I have to re-pair & re-enter my information. What's the point of wearing a tracker if it's just going to forget who you are within a matter of days?Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it happened again overnight & I'm not thrilled.",3
348,"1. I really like the ""points"" system, and that it is based on a week.  We all have days that are less active than others.  The week long system motivates me to be sure I hit my personal goal for points, even if it comes down to a very active weekend to catch up.  Which is certainly better than nothing.2.  The points seem to work for all ""levels"" of athlete.  This is pushing heart health and MOVEMENT over calories, which is what I value.3. I think the sleep is quite accurate.4.  Love the app.  there is a total wealth of information in there, and I actually really like the body scans..  It's a terrible sight, but eye opening and motivating.5. Voice - as a mother who would like very much to stop yelling, this was interesting.  II think it would be a really helpful reflection tool if you are working on your mental health..  However, with how draining it is on the battery, I turned it off after about a week.The Bad1. Battery is just OK.2. Batter is TERRIBLE if you use the voice thing.3.  I want cooler bands.4. Sometimes it's just dead, or disconnected, for no reason that I can find.  Really pisses me off when I go for a run and don't get the credit.  Because running is the worst.I'm happy with it... but I wish I had waited to get a 2nd generation or something.",3
349,"The band, monitor, and app are excellent!I've been devoted to fit lifestyle for 20+ years. Think the approach of to the activity tracking is well thought out, motivating, and provides a good overview of one's lifestyle. Good fit for beginner to novice.I have had it for three months with zero defects. Guessing it was released too soon, leading to the bad reviews. The bugs are worked out, and it fits my fitness lifestyle well.Having effective workouts that fit any type of situation (desk, lunchbreak, home, in hurry, or going all out) is a great plus. Top fitness professionals leading effective studio quality workouts. Select by type, level, body area, time, training style, other). Huge quantity of bodyweight routines.I use the app workouts to make up for missed a gym day, or to squeeze in extra workout outside of gym routine.The body scan is accurate. Its motivating to review past scans, as it provides 360 visual progress time-lapse.1. A few areas of improvement. Would like to incorporate Amazon music streaming into the workouts.2. The calories burned does not factor in muscle mass. Higher muscle mass, higher amount of energy used (even with resting hear rate). My baseline for calories burned is higher than total calories factored by the app on a highly active day, with intense workout too. My muscle mass is not taken into account.3. Need to address the calorie calculation for weight lifting too. This type of exercise does not raise heart-rate much, but is strenuous causing significant calorie burn. The calculations only take into affect heart rate, so the algorithm gives same amount of calorie burn for an intense weight session as it does for walking the same amount of time. It's incorrect.",5
350,"I gave this thing a REAL TRY.  I have been wearing it since December 2020....(Today is 4/20/2021)  All in all it is easy to wear, has some good features that might have been useful to others, just not for me. The thing that bothers me the most about it is the inaccuracy.  I have been messing with it to make sure its not ""human error"" but.......I will have it on live action and see that I am working out in the intense zone but later when I'm done with my workout, I will go back to check exactly how long intense time I got and it will tell me ZERO.  What??  I just saw that I was in the Intense zone for at the very least, FIVE minutes??  I wanted it to keep track of my movements and that's it.  It's of no use to me if its not accurate.  Sorry but I'm going to have to move on to a fitbit now. The other thing that bothers me is that the band gets absolutely filthy!!!!  Taking time to take it off and put it in the washer and then wait for it to dry is taking time off my body, again, leading to inaccuracies. Great concept.  I loved that it didn't have anything on the band itself......and the body scan was neat too....but highly inaccurate.  I really wanted to love it.....but it fell a little short for me. :(",3
351,"Love that it has no screen. I have to wear it on my dominant hand for things to be somewhat accurate steps-wise because I carry my baby in my left arm often and when there is no movement detected it doesn’t count steps.I do think it’s just a tad bulky but not bad. It gets caught sometimes if I’m tucking my shirt in or something. I don’t find it uncomfortable for the most part though. I’ve never been a watch wearer or anything and I got used to it pretty quickly.Glad it’s water resistant because I’ve definitely dunked it in the tub without realizing it while bathing my kids.I got mine during the pre-release and honestly if I had to pay full price I probably wouldn’t have. For what it is, I think $65 was good - especially considering there is a subscription for some features after the first 6mo. I only really use the sleep and activity tracking anyway. I have yet to do the body fat thing because I don’t have time. I’m curious about it though.I will say sometimes the sleep thing doesn’t seem super accurate. I get up at least 4 times a night with my infant and sometimes it doesn’t get all of them. Maybe I’m basically sleeping during that sometimes anyway though lol. So maybe it is accurate! I’ll tell ya though. It says I’m getting some really crappy sleep right now, and it’s not wrong.",4
352,"People complaining about it being ""intrusive"" or ""demotivating"" were never the right people for this product to begin with.  It tracks exactly what it says, does the body scan, like it says, monitors the tone of your voice, like it says.A couple things that are an annoyance:- The first month, the battery life is very poor, even with the microphone off.  I was getting on average 1-2 days of battery life with the microphone off when I first got the Halo.  After a month, NOW it lasts 5-7 days without a charge.- Whoever thought the charger clip design was smart needs to be examined.  Having a 0.1mm gap to place the bracelet into is a real pain.- The body fat estimation from the body scan really is not accurate.  I was at 14% body fat when I got the bracelet, but it estimated me at 22%.... so don't take the numbers too seriously, but use it as a measure for improvement regardless.Overall it's a solid tracker and it weighs so little that you forget you have it on.  Read what the product does, watch reviews, etc. before you decide to buy it.  It is not for everyone if you have concerns or are easily upset from the results.",4
353,"All of the useful information is via the Halo membership, for me personally I bought it for the “Tone” feature as I know I can have a sharpness/sarcastic tone that people often misconstrue and I wanted to work on it. It was BEYOND helpful at first - I could also tell easily where the difficult relationships in my life were, and why. Amazing. HOWEVER - at one point it disconnected from my Wi-Fi and became completely useless (don’t EVER let it totally run out of battery). After that, any link to the halo membership was gone - I’m assuming the membership must no longer be a thing and must no longer exist as I’ve tried numerous times to track down a link to renew or re-add my membership features and NOPE! I’m telling you, it just can’t exist, at least for me. Not worth the chance. Was a GREAT tool, and am SUPER frustrated it was just capped with no notice or refund. Livid, actually.UPDATE 12/27/21: An Amazon rep reached out to help me renew my membership and POOF! it worked. My mistake was that it has to be done on the web, not on the app (at least that’s how it appears to me). Now I have my super useful pieces back - I’m telling you - the part that measures your tone is CRAZY useful. It helps you evaluate ALL of your relationships, any mood swings, any loss mood disorders…I’ve found it extremely helpful in identifying points that my bf and I need to work on, more importantly information that I react negatively to but I may not think I do. You’re able to see your tone as an omniscient 3rd party.",5
354,"Overall this fitness band works very well for the average person. Some areas to improve on but we have to expect that with a new product. Heart rate monitor seems on point. I have checked it against other devices and it seems to be accurate. Step count as well seems to be accurate against other devices. I have not used the voice setting at all, didnt have an interest and it seems to dra ik n the battery much faster. W/o the voice setting better last 6 days. The body fat mapping takes some trial and error the first time you use it and I have only done it twice so I will see how it progresses over time. Sleep monitor has also been accurate as far as how long I'm asleep, not sure about all the extra information it gives you. I know some complained if you work at nights it doesnt register your sleep, however the most recent update said it was correcting this but i dont know for sure since this doesnt apply to me. The app struggles at times and takes a minute to catch up or update but I see this being resolved after a few updates.Overall I am very pleased with this band, I received this for the early price of $60 and find it well work it. I enjoy the silly design of it since ik prefer to wear a traditional watch so this doesnt stick out too much.",4
355,"I will start by saying I hoped this would be a lower cost alternative to my Whoop band. But these two bands are a world apart from each other so maybe my rating is a little biased. I wanted Halo mainly for sleep recovery info and the results were quite mixed compared to my whoop. The sleep stages and sleep quality were quite different between the two apps and so I'm not sure which one is the most accurate. But I did have a few nights where Halo didn't track my sleep because I may have slept on my wrist/band. I thought that was odd. I didn't like you had to manually track each workout and enter it instead of ""starting"" a workout. I also wished it would of kept my favorite workouts on top of the list so you wouldn't have to scroll through them all, not a big deal but it would of been more convenient. Not sure ofd the formula they use to give you points for your activities, but the yoga points are nonsense. If I did a 30 min yoga class I got 1 point, maybe Halo doesn't know yoga is kinda tough. I tried the body scan but I can't believe it can tell body fat from a pic. I would like to see some comparisons vs a real body fat test. I didn't use the workout programs at all. But overall for the monthly fee I guess its good if you don't already have a apple watch or fitbit. So compared to Whoop it's a low price, low feature alternative.",3
356,"The most common messages from the app were: 1. Something went wrong, try again; 2. Non-member view; 3. Synching; 4. Can't update your info, pull to refresh; 5. Make sure your band is on correctly and connected; and 6.  Something useless about pushing your band button twice.When that wasn't on these screens, I was often seeing Zeros across the board and blank data.  Then, I had to fidget with the Bluetooth connection.Other frustrations were:  1. Having to fiddle with the band for 5 minutes before each workout to get it to read my heart rate; 2. Activity points not showing (switching into non-member view); 3. Activity points not counting up correctly (1 pt for intense activity rather than 2pts); and 4. App crashing during workouts.The body composition option is often NOT available.I tried to screen capture the issues, but I can't post them all.

357,"I am a mobility challenged senior who was looking for something to keep me motivated to move. I also have a tendency to be snarky with answers, so the tone tracking attracted me.I gave this a 3star overall rating, mostly for effort. The features went down to a 2 star because I believe they did not deliver what was promised. There were several times during the day I staged my voice tone and those tones weren’t recorded properly or sometimes at all.As I mentioned, I am mobility challenged, so i use a walker. Whether or not the motion is recorded, at all, is questionable. I’m not worried about the points and what I am awarded, but I know I walked more than 22 steps between 10 AM and 5 PM! Accuracy is way off.The last item on my list is the band. I thought perhaps the fact it was a fabric band would make it more comfortable. NOT! The band has chafed my wrist sore; I am now sporting a band of scabs, which are ugly and useless!I too was invited to test the Halo. I ordered it in November and it shipped in January. I also paid a discounted price and was offered a 6 month trial for the program. I would really prefer to return the Halo and get refunded for it but I can’t find a return by date on my order. So, this experiment will end up in my jewelry box, no doubt. I was hoping for an encouraging frIend and ended up with another flop.",3
358,Love love love it - tone was why I got it & it turns out I don't sound as angry as others say,4
359,"I got the halo around a month ago as I received an early invitation.I previously had a Fitbit. I got this tracker because I hate having all my stats on my wrist where I am constantly gazing. This tracker band you cannot accept calls, see time.. it does nothing for you like a Fitbit. However that’s why I like it! If tracks overall progress.. not just short loved ones. The only time I watch my phone screen is when Im doing a workout for my heart rate. The wristband is surprisingly comfortable! I was worried with the Velcro that it would hurt it be itchy/ catch hair etc. but it doesn’t! I sleep with it on every night with jo problem! The body fat measurement tool is the coolest!!! Tracking from week to week I can physically see all the progress I have made!  I don’t like the tone app.. I feel like it’s not consistent with my tones (I’m sarcastic allot) and joke around so it gets confused by my actual responses. Do I turned that feature off.Benifits are if you are addicted to your current device.. this one might be the fit for you.The downside is if you want stats, you gotta pull out your phone abs scroll. But for me it’s been great! I’ve lost 5 lbs just by upping my activity for a month and am more aware of it in a healthy non addictive way.",4
360,"I love my Halo!  There is a lot to unpack with this system but I will say, each item you unpack, you will be learning more and more about who you are and who you want to be.  Not only have I lost quarantine/lockdown weight since using it but I am fitter and I feel challenged everyday to do better.The one thing I do not like is the band. I love that there are no lights or a watch.  We all check our phones enough to know what time of day it is.  The problem is my arm actually stinks!  I never take it into the shower but I do wash my hands frequently and I work out twice a day so between sweat and the hand washing, my wrist and band smell like dog butt.  I've tried washing the band to no avail.  It now smells like perfumed soap dog butt.  And, the money making machine that Amazon is, I have to spend $25 to get the band that should have come with it in the first place.  I think the cloth band should have been a secondary purchase, as it is a better look if you are dressed well.  The plastic band that should have come with it is by far a better choice for a sports band.  With that, Jeff Bezos knows what he's doing",4
361,"First, I love the modest inconspicuous look of this tracker.  I've waited for a pure fitness tracker without the look of a watch and this fits the bill perfectly.  The band is comfortable and is easy to put on and take off.The sleep tracking is great when I actually sleep at night, but when I work shifts overnight and take 2hr naps before and after the shift it doesn't track the sleep.The step tracking is great because it tracks actual movement and not just steps.  I do alot of heavy lifting work that doesn't always require alot of walking so it's good to see those motions being counted because in actuality those motions are far more intense then taking a step.The app is decent, I like the body scan, I think it goes more in depth then pretty much any other tracker or app in that regard. It's not much more to it other than links to go to other apps.  I'm not to happy about having a subscription fee if I want all the features but it's not a complete deal breaker.  The app could use more features that aren't linked to other apps.  I haven't tried any of the labs so I can't speak on those just yet, but may update once I do.All in all, it's a good all around performer, tracker and app combined.",4
362,"Firstly, this is a great product.  If you are using it for just a general overall view of things then it's fine but I had some concerns.1. Tone - I noticed that there were times when it picked up a tone that did not come from me but instead came from a show I was watching on my iPad or TV.  So if the people on TV talked then it picked their tone.  I wasn't talking at all.  So that concerned me.  I need to have confidence that it listens for me and me only.2. Privacy - If the band is picking up other people say on TV or on a show and analyzing their tone when it's not supposed to then how do I know it isn't also recording conversations and other information like it's not supposed to.  So I'm concerned about privacy.3. Band - The band is rigid, stiff, and uncomfortable.  I really didn't like the band.  And I don't think you can change it because the band appears to be glued to the device.  So if you needed a replacement band then you would be buying another device.  I think that was a horrible idea.  You should be able to replace the bands.  The picture makes it look like the band is comfortable because it's material but it's not.  It's very tough and rigid.",4
363,"EDIT: After posting this review, an Amazon rep reached out to me and offered to replace the band since it was still under the 1-year warranty. Due to this, I am changing my rating back to 4-stars, and I appreciate their swift response.This review would've been 4-star until yesterday. The Halo band itself doesn't do anything better than a FitBit, and the lack of a display makes it a bit less useful. The body fat calculator and motion assistant are pretty cool and something that FitBit doesn't have, so those were pretty cool when I remembered to use them.However... I've had the Halo for just under 10 months now, and worn it every day. I exercise regularly, hike several days a week, and generally get the band pretty sweaty, but nothing extreme, and have never worn it in the water or spilled anything on it. Last night when I took the band off, the back cover stayed stuck to my wrist. There doesn't seem to be any way to reattach it now, and it's definitely not sweat/waterproof anymore since the seal is wrecked.Pretty disappointed that this couldn't even make it one year...",4
364,"I mainly wanted a sleep tracker - but also exercise trackerThe sleep tracker is disappointing. It shows me awake much longer after bathroom breaks in the middle of the night (when I’m known to actually be asleep. If you only want very rough information it might workThe “Live” option on the fitness tracker is most helpful.  The heart rate is accurate compared to other devices. It works well allowing me to make sure I’m keeping my heart rate upIt’s less expensive than other fitness trackers, but those expecting a lot may be disappointed",3
365,"I want to start out by saying I LOVE that this product doesn’t have a screen. I find screens super distracting. I just let Halo do it’s thing and every now and then I’ll check the app. The most used feature for me is sleep monitoring and the heart monitor. I have a chronic illness so keeping up with both is important so I can notice beforehand if I will have a flare. The sleep feature has a few bugs. There are some nights it doesn’t register but it’s not often. One thing I didn’t like is it either didn’t recognize naps at all or it would detect them and the time between that and when I actually either went to bed or woke up so I’d have a low sleep score. The only real reason I use the exercise feature is to check my heart. I don’t exercise but I’ll still get points for moderate because my heart rate can be high.One issue I’ve noticed design wise is the band. Sometimes it’ll start to rub on my skin and irritate it, so I may end up getting a different band. Otherwise I don’t find it too bulky and I don’t have to wear it super tight, it sits fine and there’s enough room in the band to fit one finger. Just remember if you buy this every now and then you need to check the inside of the band because dirt and skin collects.",4
366,"It’s great for tracking sleep. And any activity I do. One person wrote a review about not getting the point you need daily…. Just don’t be sendentary more than 8 hours. That’s a lot of flexibility, and it pushes you to keep moving throughout the day. I recommend this device if you’d like to be pushed to living a better lifestyle. Getting in shape can be uncomfortable-there’s no shame here. I think this does a great job to ease that discomfort.",4
367,"I was just looking for a step tracker. I thought the voice analysis was interesting. It came with a lot more.It’s easy to use. It covers all of me. Mind, body and more.",4
368,"Almost didn't get this after reading negative reviews, but glad I did as it is a great product.  Wanted something without a display to wear as a bracelet since I wear analog watches on other wrist.Those complaining about activity score going down must be spending too much time on the couch, instructions clearly say you lose a point per hour sitting on your butt. Easy to earn it back through exercise.Halo service seems good too, may or may not keep after trial, mainly wanted step and heart monitor which this does great.Only negative is it needs internet connection to sync with app.  I keeps data offline, but u can't see on the app unless you sync while connected to internet.  If they fixed that, and integrated with MyFitnessPal, would be amazing. As is, especially for under 90 dollars,. this thing rocks.  Glad I got one before they ran out, read the bracelets were discontinued and you have to get a display when they run out...",5
369,"This device is a bit of a mixed bag. Killer features include:* Tone analysis (this is a very interesting way to understand your relationship)* Strong sleep tracking (time to sleepy and sleep quality are both good)* Body fat analysis* Heart rate and activity calculationAll of these are actually pretty good and deliver.After 3 months of use, I'm convinced it's not ready:* The mobile app is terrible. Amazon doesn't do app development and it shows. It's really too bad, they jammed too many features that work poorly. The app isn't responsive and doesn't load. Strange and almost inconceivable for a device that's been sold this many times.* The lack of integrations is also strange: you want to measure my activity and give people the ability to do headspace meditations, but not actually track if they have the headspace app and meditations?* The charger breaks and doesn't work. This is a big issue and it's known. So if you're buying the device, expect to have the device bricked or have Amazon send you a new chargerUnfortunately, the combination of these things not working make it a novelty for a few months, but hard for me to keep the motivation to do anything but tone analysis on a daily basis.Which is... kind of fine? I like that feature. It's just that they shouldn't have promised so much more to get people to buy a wearable, only to disappoint the majority of those 'fitness' expectations.",3
370,The halo is overall a pretty good fitness tracker. Price point compared is fair and the app is ok but you really need to get the membership to experience everything it has to offer the price for membership is not bad. It’s very rugged I have put this little band through hell and so far it has held up. but it is lacking in some areas it’s compatibly with other apps is non existent which is somewhat disappointing but I’m hoping in the near future that is corrected.if your looking for a reasonably priced fitness tracker this is for you.,3
371,"This is an update to my first posting: Although I am disappointed that Halo did not work, I was successful in contacting customer service a third time and they were wonderful to work with. They agreed to a return and a refund because at this time they are out of stock and could not replace. With this experience I have to increase my stars to 4 and commend Amazon for GREAT customer service. Thank you!!!  **** I received this as a gift in February 2021. Because it was purchased in January 2021 I was unable to return it because the return time window had expired even though I had not been using the device for the first 30 days. From the beginning the unit does not come close to counting my steps correctly. It is way over calculating the number of steps. I am 71 years old and it has me doing several hundred steps before I even get out of bed. Throughout the day it gives me hundreds of steps that I certainly am not doing. I contacted customer service twice and they have failed to ever get back to me about the problem. Now the product support link is no longer active. At this point I guess I write this off as an expensive error in judgement. Don't make the same mistake as I did, don't buy this.",4
372,"I purchased this back in November, her are my thoughts on this after using it for some time now . At most it’s ok . Sleep tracking has been hit or miss ,sometimes it’s spot on and sometimes it says I’m asleep when I am not, hopefully that gets better over time and updates. I stopped using the tone feature as it just annihilated the battery. I haven’t had any skin irritation from wearing it as well. As far as activity tracking it seems to measure it fine compared to my Fitbit Inspire HR that I also wore at the same time for comparison. Not having a screen is not  a great selling point ,since have to pull out my phone to check various stats and progress which defeats the purpose of no screen. It’s lack of integration with other fitness apps like Apple Health or Google fit could be a deal breaker for some. The tone feature itself is cool to see how you come across but the novelty wears off on that quickly as mentioned above it’s not worth the trade off in battery life and yes taking your photo for the BMI measurements is optional and you don’t have to do it ,but it’s one of the main features of this band. So if you are a bit self conscious about your weight or body composition this may not be for you.  Overall it’s ok but isn’t always accurate and the lack of integration with other fitness tools or apps currently limits its value and potential.",3
373,"So to start off, I’m a personal trainer with years of fitness and sports experience, even at the collegiate level so “activity” has been a part of my life for a long time. I have never had an activity tracker before (smart watch and/or Fitbit) which I know are the common ones, so my review may be a bit bias, but not uneducated nonetheless. Halo does a FANTASTIC job at tracking my HR, steps, calories, time spent doing each activity and more. Like I said, activity tracking isn’t something I’m new to, just use to having to do it manually, but as far as I can tell this thing is pretty spot on. The tracking for sleep is also pretty neat. I’m a pretty self aware person so I can usually tell how good my sleep is or how fast I fall asleep so sometimes I feel like it’s off a little here and there but for the most part, pretty accurate and insightful. As for the tone tracking portion, I’m not really sure what use it is to people other then a cool feature in case you wanted to track something like that, but like I said, if you’re a self aware person already, you can tell when you’re using a happy tone or an irritated tone but still cool to see feed back. And the app itself is awesome. Very insightful and lots of good information to help you learn more about your body and how to help yourself in ways you may not know. Don’t let the bad reviews from the people that have no idea what they are talking about steer you away from the product. In most cases they just need something that lets them know if they walked 5 miles in a day or not lol. All in all, GREAT PRODUCT!!",5
374,"I have had the Halo since early release in November.  So far the App is the winner, it's fairly easy to navigate and interpret the information.  It's got a wealth of programs and information to help you become healthier.  The sleep tracker is okay but you need to get right out of bed and into bed.  It measures total time in bed unlike Fitbit. It does a better than expected job of interpreting the data.  Measureing body temperature as you sleep is an interesting bit of information it tracks.  The activity tracker is fair as well but it's not very sensitive.  It only picks up my workouts after I've really increased the intensity level.  My warm-ups and low intensity activities have to be inputted manually.  Hopefully there's a learning curve and it gradually notices the changes in my Activity levels.  I do like the addition and subtraction of active points and sedentary points to give you a picture of much time you actually spend inactive.  The body scan feature is a plus too just be sure to good lighting.  You can keep an accountability photo journal of your fitness progress.  There's no display face on the band.  Not a problem for those of us who wish to disconnect for awhile and focus on ourselves.  No calls, text messages or social media notifications.",4
375,"Pros:Sleep tracker - doesnt really know when you're napping but at night its pretty spot onBattery life - my absolute favorite thing was only having to charge this once a week ( i have ""tone"" set to off)Design - I have been looking for a subtle design such as this with no screen for a long time since I have a bad record with Smartwatches (I've cracked two)App - the app itself is super useful and shows you your activity levels, bpm, sleep as well as some other useful fun misc stuff (i.e. videos tips music etc)Cons:Comfort - a bit thicker than expected so it can get in the way when trying to reach into pocketLacks Blood-oxygen level reader, this is a huge upset for me but I should have read through the items description and features first instead of assuming.$3.99/mo - It's great that you get 6months free when you buy this new and to be honest it's fairly priced but I somehow feel that this should be included with the price if the Halo since its practically half useful without the premium version of the Halo app.",4
376,"I have had this for about a week and only charged it when I received it (it had a partial charge so only took about ten minutes to get to 100%). The battery is great! I only wear it when I am intentionally exercising and it's really fun to see my heart rate. It's also very motivational because it awards you points based on how much you exercise, so you can have challenges with yourself based around the point system. I have sweat quite a bit while wearing this and it doesn't slide down or effect the readings which is great. I bought it in the pink color which wasn't the smartest because it has quickly discolored - I would recommend the black or buying an accessory band that Amazon offers. As for the ""Tone"" feature, I do not use it and I think it is the only downfall of the watch. You do not have to set it up in the app and you can keep the microphone muted by pressing the button two times (a red light will flash twice to indicate the microphone is muted). I have not used the body fat scanner yet, but you do not have to be naked for it, you can wear underpants, a bra and a mask, so its not a big deal. The sleep tracker is also very informative and I think being cognizant of my sleep quality has actually improved my sleep patterns over the past week. If I have any problems, I will update this review. And just to reiterate, I do not wear this watch all day -- only when I sleep and when I am purposefully exercising, and in that context I have had no skin irritation from the band that others have noted. I lift weights for about 1 hour per day and the information on the band has been very informative since it is hard to find information on calories burned while lifting weights.",5
377,"I could see how this thing could literally save someone's life. That being said, I really wish I could connect it to two devices. I understand that security wise this creates complications. Still:Call me crazy, but I like to mainly use my active phone for calls and texts, to conserve battery life. Instead, around the house, I have old devices that I use for everything else. I have my band synced to a different device, and there's actually enough memory that I can take it out of the house and come back and it'll sync. But then I can't tell it if I start running etc. So yeah, let my connect it to one device at home and a different one for mobile networks, to save phone battery life",3
378,"So, bought my Halo just a little over a year ago and really love it!  MOST OF THE TIME.  Some mornings I wake up and it has nothing for my sleep that night.  Today I've been going all day and it still says 822 steps.  It's syncing, but not tracking.  They were on sale today for $45, so I'll do it again and hope this new one lives a little longer!",4
379,"I took the Movement assessment last week and the results were not showing up in the Halo app. I waited but it was  taking too long to load. So I took another assesssment and it was experiencing the same problem. So, I didn't do the third time because I was sore from the assessment, so I skipped it. Until a week later, I did it again and it's experiencing the same problem. I might as well skip it, it's a waste of time to wait for the Movement results to load. I have important excercises to do than this Movement assessment loading a blankness results. I use the body scan and it stated I have 38% body fat. Oh well, I don't care if it's 38%. It's been 38% since last month so this would not demotivate me. As long I excercise, I'm good. I would raise a star about the problem with the movement result. The Tone part is funny, it stated that my voice sounded like depressed and disinterested. That is true because I don't talk loud. This is something I need to work on that. The sleep tracking part is not bad. It doesn't record naps but it'll recorded my daytime sleeping time. It would let me know if I have 3 hours of sleep and would give me a poor score. It's because of sleep deprivation due to homework assignments and studying for an important.",3
380,I like the sleep application gives you great detail but not going to pay for the service as the gear 4 watch actually records snoring.  This is good for other things but for one the band is as almost as high as the actual product if you want a different color band.  For now I'll skip this one.,4
381,"I mainly use my Halo for sleep tracking. One of the reasons I was drawn to the Halo is the soft band and sleek look. I know I can't sleep with a big, clunky watch on and the Halo is hardly noticeable. The sleep tracking is interesting. I really like how it breaks up your sleep into the 3 phases and shows you how long you're in that phase (light, REM, deep). Tracks sleep disturbances which is helpful for me so I can better understand my sleep patterns.I haven't used the body monitoring part of the app yet. The tone option is neat and seems pretty accurate. HR monitor matches up with what the treadmill at the gym says so I think it is pretty accurate. Since it can track body temp changes it would be nice to see what actual body temp is instead of just the change. Esp with all of the body temp checking that happens all the time now because of covid. The fitness tracking matches pretty well with whatever activity I am doing. Battery is pretty decent. I try to charge it everyday when I am in the shower.I do wish the band was washable. If it is I haven't figured out how to make that happen. Overall I really like my Halo.",4
382,I mainly use an Apple Watch. I only wear this to bed to track my sleep and it works just fine for that. It’s cool to check the app in the morning to see how I slept.,4
383,"I have mixed feelings about this one.I love:1. The sleep tracker. It's by far the most accurate I've used and is very detailed.2. The tips it gives about health3. The voice tone is creepy but at the same time kind of cool.I hate:1. If you're a super short person or under a certain weight, you can't use the BMI/Health tracker. This makes most of its features worthless.2. I hate the way you charge it. You have to get it just right, or it won't charge.3. The deal breaker for me - it would constantly freeze and disconnect from the app, which would require me to erase and reconnect everything in the app. It got to the point I had to stop using it.",2
384,"So far, i REALLY like my Halo. I like the band - it's soft and comfortable.  I was worried that the hardware would feel too big and bulky, but it's fine.  I LOVE that it doesn't have a face.  I'm easily distracted, and I really appreciate that ""there's nothing to see here.""  As for the app...so far so good.  I enjoy checking my sleep score, I like being able to do live exercises and track my heart rate, and I like the point system.  I don't plan to do the body fat analysis, but I did the movement analysis, and I'm working through the corrective practices, which I'm enjoying.  The one missing thing is that there is no way to track nutrition.  I have a recent diagnosis, and I'm trying to get my hands around my sodium, potassium, and a few other things.  I heard that Halo will be adding a nutrition piece in 2022, so I'm hopeful.  Anyway...it's only 1 week in, but so far so good.  I'll update again in the future.ADDENDUM December 24, 2021: I loved my Halo until yesterday.  Prompted by the fact that the green light would not stop, I took off the Halo and found that the back cover was gone and the plastic around the edges was melted.  Since I don't take the Halo off except to shower, I'm not sure when this happened or how. but am assuming it got too hot or something next to my wrist.  I have contacted customer service and am waiting to hear if the band will be replaced.",5
385,"My subject sums up how I view this product, but I will elaborate here for those that are interested.I was excited to order and try this product. Knowing that it has the backing of a company like Amazon meant that my expectations were going to be high.The initial setup was a breeze, but as I played with the app I started seeing how underwhelming it is.No diet tracking, no workout logs, no social features, poor UI.... I was legitimately surprised to see such a poor offering.The product itself leaves A LOT to be desired. My biggest issue is one that leaves the device totally worthless. If you aren't on a strong internet connection the app won't work. If that the app isn't working, the device doesn't work. There's no offline mode. This seems like a collosal oversight. Not all gyms offer wifi, not all running trails have a signal. How can a fitness tracker not track fitness!?The software also gets confused. There. Have been several times when I'm in the middle of a run, yet my sedentary time is ticking away??? I'm literally working out, yet the band thinks I'm sitting down resting.The sleep tracker doesn't work consistently either. It's happened several times over the last few months where I'll wake up and it says I got 2-3 hours of sleep, when I got more like 6-7 hours. Oh, the sedentary timer will also penalize you for sleeping, which makes total sense to me haha.When the Halo works, it's fine. It's nothing exceptional. There are definitely better offerings than this, and at a lower or similar price point.To summarize, I'm going to buy a new tracker. I would HIGHLY recommend not buying this.10/11/2022- UpdateGot a new phone and now the band won’t pair with my iPhone 14 Pro Max. I’ve followed the instructions several times, it simply won’t pair. After less than a year with this product I can’t stress this enoughDO NOT BUY THE AMAZON HALO. It’s buggy, doesn’t work consistently, lacks features other products have had for years, and simply isn’t worth the money. If the Amazon Halo were free, you could probably still do better.Update 11/10/22Decided to try and pair the device again. Made sure everything was updated. Factory reset the Halo. Went to pair it to my new phone. Failed. Tried again. Failed. Tried again. Failed.What an abomination of a product. Amazon should be ashamed of how poorly designed this tracker is.",1
386,"I LOVE how the watch has NO SCREEN because then it will NOT accidentally flash light in my face when I'm trying to sleep.I spent 10 minutes to do the Body Scan using my phone camera & the Amazon Halo App. Then my results showed that my hips are weak, although I'm only 25 years old and very average weight!!! And then it recommended hip workout videos for me, which I have not been able to commit to doing daily ..yet.I like the sleep monitoring too. (Because when I tried a cheap $30 fitness monitor, it also tracked sleep data, but the data was presented in a less cohesive manner.)""Amazon Halo watch's sleep monitoring"" sounds much more legit to me. I feel more comfortable trusting sleep data from a big company like Amazon.I know that Amazon would update the watch software, sell replacement batteries & bands, etc. Even if Amazon doesn't sell it, other people will sell knockoffs, and then I can get what I need.(But for my old $30 fitness band, the app is horrible .. hence rendering the purchase useless, the company is nowhere to be found, and will make it impossible for me to fix the old band.)Therefore, I'm a big fan of having spent $100 on my Amazon Halo watch.My big warning: eventually they are going to charge you a monthly fee extra data which can be accessed through the app. It's only free for the first 6 months. Good thing the fee is OPTIONAL and the basic features will work even without the fee ... since this is a screen-less model.",5
387,"Everything works great. I love the health point system, where you lose points for sitting too much, and you gain more points the harder you are exercising. I also really like the body scanning feature. While it does seem a bit weird to be standing in your underwear while your phone takes pictures of you, the technology behind it is useful, and I do trust the privacy measures they have in place. I also really, REALLY like the voice and tone tracking. Being in a management position, it's extremely helpful to see how various situations effect your general tone.What I don't like is the sleep tracker. It does track your various stages of sleep, which is nice, but it is awful at figuring out the quality of that sleep. There are nights where I'm tossing and turning all night, waking up all the time but still laying there, getting up to take care of the kids, etc. On those following mornings, I wake up exhausted, but the Halo app is sitting there telling me I had the best sleep of my life. Needs a bit work, for sure.Overall, this is a great first step to an amazing device. I would pay for this just for the voice function. It's so valuable to making sure I am coming across the ways I intend when it's most important.",4
388,"FIRST OF ALL, IGNORE ALL REVIEWS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY HAD THEIR HALO FOR A VERY SHORT TIME.In the beginning, it seems like a great device.... until you actually use it for a while. Once you get to the point of having to pay for the membership you'll realize that it isn't worth the subscription price. Without the features that are subscription-only the device is basically worthless.I've had my Halo for almost a year. It could have been a great product, but it is just okay. There are better options out there that don't require a paid membership to use most features.Without the membership, the band is basically just a step counter. Simple features that don't cost Amazon a thing are only available in the membership. So be prepared to pay the membership fee for the entire time you own the Halo. It might only be $3.99 a month, but you can get the same features and more with a FitBit or Garmin with no monthly fee. FitBit does offer a paid membership, too, but their free app is still far better than Halo's paid membership and they offer many third-party integrations. Halo only integrates with WW and John Hancock Vitality (whatever that is). Halo isn't supported by any other apps, like My Fitness Pal for example.The features that should set Halo apart from the competition (Tone and Body Composition) don't really work. They are both extremely inaccurate. If those features really interest you, you are going to be very disappointed.The app has recipes, but no nutrition tracking at all and, again, it doesn't integrate with other popular apps like My Fitness Pal. It has fitness programs, mindfulness, etc. in the ""Discover"" section of the app (requires membership), but it's basically all stuff you get get for free other places.Ultimately, the band itself is pretty limited in features (step counter, sleep tracker & HR monitor) with the heart rate monitor being the only thing that really adds some value. You can get step counting and sleep tracking on cheapo fitness trackers. There's nothing special there. The paid membership to the app is where they give you the ""features"". But, pretty much all those features are available elsewhere for free (the features that work) and some don't even work properly.UPDATE: I ended up replacing my Halo with a Garmin. The Garmin is light years ahead of the Halo and the app is completely free. There's no membership fee at all. The Garmin also provides much more detailed information and motivation for both exercise and general health. The Garmin can also share information with MyFitnessPal, which is really great. Get a Garmin or get a Fitbit. The Halo might be worth $65 if they had no membership fee at all. It isn't worth $99, regardless of whether or not there's a membership fee.",1
389,"I really do like the sleek look of the Halo and the comfort of wearing it. That being said, there are times where it will pinch and will leave a sort of green residue on my arm. I have switched wearing it on my left arm to my right as the sleep tracker would interpret my lack of movement with my left arm as being asleep when I was actually writing with or using my right arm. I have found this gives a more accurate reading of my sleep patterns. The battery lasts about four days if I do not have the band sync too many times during the day. I will probably be ordering a new band so I can wash this one more often.***6 Months later***Now that I have had this tracker for six months here are some other issues I have found. The band is impossible to clean. I wash it about twice a month but it gets pretty dingy, and I work in an office. I can only imagine how dirty it would become for someone in a more active position. Also, I now have to keep the charger closed with a rubber band as it will not close enough for the contacts to connect. It will also stop charging at 70%. I haven't been able to get a full charge for the last couple of months.",4
390,"This is an OK product especially if you’re inactive looking to get active - but I was really expecting better.Cons-My biggest gripe is that the HR monitor just really isn’t accurate and is frustrating to use. During my first workout became incredibly frustrated that after doing burpees the live HR monitor only had me at 96 bpm, kept an eye on it and it just always seemed to lag.I started comparing against my Bose sound sport ear buds which are pretty accurate vs chest strap monitor and they were often wildly different. Across HIIT workouts, bike rides, and hikes the Halo band just never seemed to be aligned. I also cross checked this using a finger pulse oximeter and those results aligned more with my Bose sound sport than my halo band.Other gripe is that it decides when to start tracking your workout, so pair that with an inaccurate HR monitor my workouts were always much shorter on my halo band than on my other fitness tracker. You also can’t dig into the data more and all the aspects of the charts are fixed, you can’t glean any detail from it.My take on this overall is that if you’re already active but looking to step up your game go with a chest strap HR monitor or a smart watch and you’ll be happier.For the Tone analysis, it’s not really helpful as you have no info other than its analysis and time stamp; essentially you have zero context as to what you said or how it interpreted it. It’s basically useless detail as you can’t really get anything concrete to improve upon, it’s a data point with zero actionable information. Overall this was kind of like the band saying “cheer up”.Pros-The app really does give you a lot, between the activity tracking, sleep tracking, workouts and other labs there is a lot to get people started if you’re wanting a fresh fitness start. The info will get you motivated and the lab workouts will give you programs to do.Takeaway -I got this on the early invite program, so the band itself was discounted versus the $99 price it is now. Even being discounted this wasn’t for me and I plan on returning it. I easily hit the 150 point goal my first full week and really don’t think it gave me much. Pairing that with the bad HR monitor I’m looking elsewhere for my fitness and health needs.",2
391,The Halo band is great mostly because there is nothing on the face to distract you or interrupt parts of your day like other bands.  The sleep tracking is crazy accurate and it’s slim so it’s comfortable to wear all day and night.,4
392,"I love this fitness tracker. I have tried and still own Fitbit (charger and blaze) and Samsung watch, and I still prefer this tracker for my health (not exercise).Pros:* I truly forget that I am wearing it. Not sure if others don't follow the instructions, but my tracker is so light and comfy, I don't mind wearing it to bed (I have the cloth band).* It is waterproof. I swam with it in the ocean and took a shower with it. No problems. It also dries super fast.* it charges in about 1 hour. The app sends me an automatic notification as soon as it is full. I love it!* The labs are so useful! And they are automatically tracked. I literally don't have to log anything.* The Body feature is awesome. I may not like what it shows me, but it is a cool feature. And no other tracker has it (that I have heard of).* Watch lasts longer than my Fitbit or Samsung watch (when the Tone is off).* The Halo doesn't distract me.* Charging is so easy. And it has a red led light to show that it is indeed charging.* Gives a rating to your sleep that is calculated based on how long and how well you slept. It helps identifying the areas where you need to improve.* It truly helps creating better habits. No other tracker is doing that.Cons:* The battery does drain within 1 day if the Tone is on. Not really a con, but I wish it lasted longer.* You do need your phone to get the full advantage of the tracker. This is not a con to me, as this is essentially a phone accessory.* The charger is not elegant. It is simple. Very simple.* No charging block included. You don't really need one, as you can charge it from a laptop (what I do).",5
393,"1-13-22 - the charger, which sits in a drawer until I need it has stopped worked.  It has not been abused.  I was thinking about getting another Halo but now that the charger has died after limited use and careful storage I'm pretty much over this product.  I think I will miss the info but I will not miss the hassle.I bought this to track activity and upload to WW app.  It's kind of a pain to reconnect to phone if it gets 'forgotten' from Bluetooth or if you get a new phone (had both happen) but not unsurmountable.  The sleep data is interesting but I sleep pretty well it didn't make any life changes for me.  The activity data tracked well but this week I started shorting me on minutes like 1/4 of the time.  I charged it, it changed straps, all the things but it just seems to not be working and of course because it's a crappy Amazon product there is not support.  My 'support window' closed on 12/21.  I don't think I'm willing to invest in a new one every six months so I'll be looking for a new activity tracker that isn't a watch.",3
394,"I loved the product packaging, it was truly frustration free and super easy to open. I wish all electronic items learned from this packaging style. The items looks good and was packed well and compact. Full points to ease of access and carbon footprint.Alas, the product itself didn't do justice to the looks. The setup process is 'really' clunky. I saw the ""white light"" blink and then waited eons for it to pair. Then I did the factory reset (after taking it out of the clip and putting it back 17 times - exactly, I counted). After that the white light blinked once. Then it was gone, with all other lights and signals, and hopes. Then the device didn't respond to anything. For a device that claims to help improve your health, it started with raising my stress level after I tested my electrical outlets to make sure I had current.Then I called the customer service number. [It rang, told me the wait was <1 min, then played some music and abruptly hung up on me or went silent] x 4 (again, I counted). At that point I gave up.Don't use the device, there is a lot to be improved here and with a TON of options out there, wait for the early adapters to beat the kinks out of this one before you invest.P.S the 3 stars are for the looks only.",3
395,"Halo was given to me as a gift.  As I’m not a digital-savvy person, I was not very enthusiastic about its use at the beginning.  ~~ Surprisingly, however,  after I have used two of the programs (i.e. Sleep and Voice Tone) that are built-in Halo, I am now eager to use Halo continuously and explore all other programs that Halo presents.Let me share briefly the experiences that I’ve gained using the aforementioned two programs of Halo.●SleepI have a chronic sleeping issue. I’ve tried many different pills doctors recommended, natural products, special food, various exercises, and body movements, yoga, etc. None of these seemed to work for me. However, “Halo” gave me great hope. ~ The graph of my sleep patterns that Halo presents in the morning is very interesting and helpful.  It shows how often I wake up during the night before (week,..) and indicates different levels of sleep (awake, rem, light deep). This will certainly help me do something to improve my sleep quality as well as quantity!● Voice ToneI’ve often wanted to know about how my voice is perceived by others, especially when I speak in public.I read the phrases that Halo presented to me. ~ Its result was: “ Focused, Interested, Confused.”When reading I paid attention to my reading (i.e Focused)  and that I was curious about its result (i.e. Interested).  But I did not expect that I sounded ""Confused.""Come to think of it, there were some words/phrases that I mumbled a little bit; I don’t know why I did though.  This program is very attractive in that I can learn how to control my voice the way I want it to be if I experiment/try it several times in different ways.",5
396,"This tracker is very good for tracking sleep.  It is interesting to use the tone analyzer.  The body fat tracker seems less accurate than I was hoping for, as after losing a decent amount of weight and adding a lot of exercise, it actually states my percentage has gone up.  The activity tracker is ok, although you do lose points for sedentary time, which is probably accurate.  They say sitting is the new smoking, but when you work a desk job it is hard to get in enough activity to counter it.  I mis-measured my size needs and had to reorder a band that would actually fit me, but there are a couple of nice bands to choose from and that was on me.  The battery does not last more than a day and a half to two days if you use all the features and check on it regularly.  I also would really like to see a tracker that is a hundred dollars work with more than one diet program.  Currently this band works only with WW.  Hopefully that will be an update in the future.  I do find that I wish for the clock function more than I thought I would, and am considering swapping to a band that has that feature.",4
397,"Really doesn't pick up voice that well or often. I've reset voice profile multiple times. Also was forced to factory reset device after an orange light device failure. Also, the straps are very, very small. Buy a large if you are someone who has transitioned from a bottle to solid food already.",4
398,"I got it during early access. I wanted something that wasn’t a watch, simple, and easy to use. While it is all of that, i got it mainly for the body fat. However that’s where they fall very short. It’s disappointing and I fear it can drive some people to have body dysmorphia. I am a fairly petite, mildly active woman (110lbs, 5’1, wear size 0-2). It claims I have 29-31% body fat and am borderline overweight for my weight and height. My scale says I am at at 21% body fat. I believe I am closer to my scale range than the band. It definitely had me thinking I was fat for a little while... but after looking at my body I know this to be untrue. In addition, the band has nothing to do with how they determine body fat. It’s purely through images. It’s unfortunate but I guess tracking body fat instantly was too good to be true. I will still use it for heart rate and sleeping monitoring. But do not have to pay a monthly subscription for that. Also all the people having trouble charging it must really not be looking because it takes me usually 1 try, maybe 2-3 if I fumble. The app is great as it has many included workouts, haven’t used them though I like that I have the option. Battery is great because I don’t use the voice monitoring. Can go 2+ days without charging and it charges very fast.",3
399,"Once all is loaded and ready which did take some effort, my halo has been great. Worn for over a month. Tracks everything. Body scans are interesting but informative. I would like the band to integrate more with other devices i.e. my peloton bike. Also might be nice since it recognizes my voice, if I could just tell it “halo Im lifting weights” so band would know what Im doing and learn quicker.Overall though it is less to deal with compared to my apple watch. I look forward to see the evolution of the band.Update 12/25/2020Band working great. Never leaves my wrist but to charge which I do once a day after I wake up. Quick charge.Band has charted my progress in most aspects of my day to day. My workouts, heart, sleep, body,  speech. I would like more integration with my peloton and tread though.I will update as i progress. I feel this is an excellent tool for wellness.",4
400,"Switched from my Apple Watch series 5 44mm cellular to Halo band simply because it lasts longer (all week without tone setup) and therefore does things I specifically wear it for, like measuring heart rate,  activity intensity, and sleep tracking so much better and more accurately than Apple Watch, which I had to charge daily and therefore would regularly miss parts of my day.The Halo band is so much more comfortable to wear than larger and heavier Apple Watch, the band that comes with Halo is also much more comfortable and stays in place compared to the rubber one that came with Apple Watch. The charging clip also makes so much more sense than the Apple Watch’s  charger that was very flimsy and would not stay connected to the watch firmly.For the health/ vital sign tracking, Halo does a great job of tracking my heart rate and activity intensity throughout the day, captures my runs accurately, and other minor activities throughout the day. Although I wish it had a better run/jog tracking feature like pace. Sleep monitoring is top notch, I believe it is very accurate and actually uses body skin temperature fluctuations on top of your heart rate to determine the quality of your sleep. I love the labs and other challenges that encourage you to really look at fitness and health differently: rather than having to commit a lot of time to fitness it’s important to take small steps and fit in exercise and healthy habits whenever you can. That’s how I started working out. Very good approach by Amazon.For body scanning, you just have to take pics in your underwear if you feel comfortable. I do and it is another awesome health feature that is meant to be used every couple of weeks for additional progress check. Amazon don’t stop improving this. My fav Amazon product so far!",5
401,"Jan 20, 2021 update:  In my previous 1-star review I noted that ""it tracks the data fine until I wake up but never tracks it again after that"" but after some experimentation, I figured out a way to resolve that - do not sync the halo to the app until you are finished sleeping.  Once I did that, it tracked the sleep accurately.  Additionally, I really like the clear way that it presents the data - so bravo for that.Amazon should consider a new version of the halo that does NOT INCLUDE the body composition and tone of voice options because that would make it five-star product, IMO.**************************Sleep tracking seems to assume that you do not wake up during the night to use the restroom, which is not the case for 50+ individuals.  It tracks the data fine until I wake up but never tracks it again after that. For example, it will track my sleep data fine from 9:30 pm until I wake up at 1:00 am, but it will never track the data from 1:15 am until 7:30 am. So, sadly, the device is not useful to me for that reason.  I will look into a sleep tracker that has the ability to work with a person who wakes up several times a night to use the restroom.",4
402,"The one thing I really like about the Halo is the ability to analyze body composition.  I find that interesting and helpful, and I think it's probably pretty accurate.The second most-liked feature is the activity tracker, although I'm not as convinced that's as accurate as it could be.The voice analysis feature could be pretty cool, but it uses up the battery really fast, so I ended up turning that off after a few days of using it when I first got it.The app itself is okay, nothing really outstanding, and it's often slow to load.  It's supposed to sync your data once an hour -- it doesn't.  I find I have to manually go into the app and then it will sync; it doesn't do it automatically.There is one thing that is totally exasperating about the Halo:  I've had it only three months, and I've had to do a factory reset three times due to various problems.  The first reset was because it would not charge.  The second was because it became totally nonresponsive no matter what you did.  And the third reset was because it kept blinking green after taking it off my wrist, and would not stop blinking.  Because of these issues, I'm really kind of fed up with the Halo and won't be continuing my subscription to the cloud tracking once my six months is up.",3
403,"I bought the Halo for one reason. I have a small kiddo and I manage a team of people and I wanted to know how my tone could be perceived by others. I was excited to try this out when I'm talking to my son and when I have 1:1s to learn how I come across to others. The Halo did do that job pretty well but that isn't why it changed my life.When I started wearing it to track sleep I was getting really low scores. The highest I ever saw was a 49, the lowest was 18, and I routinely was in the 30's. I always felt tired but I didn't really realize how bad my sleep was. I knew I snored and thought maybe I have sleep apnea so I went to my doctor and setup an appointment for a sleep study. The numbers were terrible. I stopped breathing more than 100 times an hour. I've been using a CPAP for a few weeks now and I'm sleeping better, feeling better and I really do have the Halo to thank for giving me some numbers that made it apparent how bad the problem was. I've used Fitbit and other devices/apps to track sleep before but never did I get feedback in a way that helped me realize how bad I was sleeping.The activities are great especially the ones that are auto tracking so all you have to do is join the challenge and wear your Halo. I can't wait to see where they take it from here and I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars on the app is that lately it's crashed more than a few times but usually when I reopen it, it's fine.",5
404,"The device is fairly simple. It isn't fancy, and the app is kind of garbage. Pairing it the first time was easy, but when it came unpaired somehow, re-pairing it was a nightmare. It is supposed to blink white, but it will sometimes blink in 3 quick bursts in between long pauses. Is that the blinking it means, I ask myself? It says to press once and the second press hold in so it will factory reset and a purple light will turn on. I did that. Nothing. I did it 20 times. I got it to work once. Says the band is paired, it's in the app, it's all good. Well, in the app I walk around, it shows no steps. I go to live to check my heart rate, no heart rate showing. I am dead, I guess?I unpair again, the white light never blinks. I factory reset, it finally shows the purple light after doing the double press 27 times. Maybe putting it into the charger will do it, as the directions say.Here is the biggest problem- some complete idiot designed this charger. It is next to impossible to get it to seat into the charger properly. When I first hooked it up, I tried 20 different times to seat it. I had to call amazon, and they said it was a faulty unit, but I see on reddit everyone has this same issue. I see many people here have the same issue. It is nearly impossible to get it to sit in the charger. Today I look, and one of the 4 metal pins is bent over. No wonder, you have to push it in and out, contort it 100 ways to get it to charge. It's awful.I might contact amazon, because no way the charger pins should be bent after having this for a couple months. I might not, as the product is that annoying, I feel like maybe I will just go with another brand.I do like being in the amazon ecosystem that also includes all my echos and echo shows, amazon buds, etc. But this charger ruins it.I did one of the membership challenges...they are mostly silly. You don't need a band to do any of them really. It's stuff like ""eat more greens."" Sorry, I don't need John Hopkins to tell me to do that. I'm not an idiot. The 3D body scan looked pretty accurate, but I have no idea how it will help you really but to see any changes in the long run, which is nice, but you could also just take a picture of yourself. I guess the body fat composition stuff is good, but how accurate it is, I have no idea. Do most people who lose some weight or get in shape really care what their body fat % is anyhow?I wanted to love it, but this seems like a beta device they just rushed out, and that charger. Whoever designed that charger should not be an engineer.",1
405,"I have not used the body image option, so no comments.  I am 72 years old and have lost over 50 lbs. in the last 18 months.  I am not focused on bmi or body imagery.  I like the exercise function because it counts steps and lets me enter cycling on my stationary bike as an exercise.  It also credits me for increased heart beat which happens when I split firewood (an unusual exercise).  The sleep function is interesting.  I am learning about how to interpret information such as changes in my body temperature.  Learning what variables go into great sleep.  Voice tone has proven interesting.  I am a retired forensic mental health professional.  40 years of not showing emotions in face or voice is an old habit to break.  Working with it.  I like the app on my cell and have no trouble connecting it to band.  Wish battery on band would last 3 days.  If I don't recharge it before 36 hours it can run out of juice during the night.  I see reviews saying that this product is most intrusive on privacy.  I find prostate exams to be intrusive but helpful and necessary.  I am not turned off by providing objective data to be included in an ai logrhythm.",4
406,"I was told about the Halo by some friends who got the early deal and I managed to get it on the deal as well. I really wanted to love it, but it fell short in comparison to other fitness trackers on the market.Pros-Stays charged a long time. The battery doesn't go down nearly as fast as my Galaxy watch or my Fitbit would.It's comfortable but be sure to wear it 2 finger widths under your wrist, not on your wrist bone or over it. Worn in the correct position it did an awesome job of tracking my activities automatically. I can't think of anytime that I have had to manually enter an activity. Plus you can edit what the activity was by choosing from a list of activities in the app so you can see what type of workouts work better for you.It's awesome at tracking your heart rate during an activity and showing how many minutes were spent at each intensity level. I feel like that helped give me an accurate calorie burn count for the day.I really liked the point system given for activities but on days when I was up and down at my computer a lot, I didn't earn much for that, so if that's regular for you, you may want to try a different tracker.The app seems to have a lot of different workout sessions to choose from which seems really interesting and probably worth the fee but I haven't tried any of them.Cons-Sleep tracking was horrible, not accurate at all. My Fitbit and Galaxy watch tracked my sleep much more accurately. The Halo doesn't even pick up if you get up and go to the bathroom during the night. Half the time it didn't pick up the correct time that I fell asleep.Body scan is just bad, really, really bad. Even if my body fat % was as much as it said it was, it only showed I had a .2% fat reduction after a 1 month weight reduction of 10lbs. So out of 10lbs I only lost ¹/²lb of fat? I exercise too much to believe that could be true.The charger was a little difficult to get connected correctly but it usually makes contact if you wiggle it around in the dock a little bit.Overall, other fitness trackers on the market are way ahead of the Halo.",2
407,"Bought the Halo Band on September 21st. Today (November 20th) it died. Won't connect to the app (rebooted my iPhone), reset the band (hold button 15 seconds), App doesn't respond to band button double-click. Reviewed the diagnostic steps for this condition and no joy. One month return so it looks like I'll eat the cost.Having said that, I was monitoring my sleep using the Band and was attempting to utilize its scoring to improve. Given that the hardware died I now question whether the monitoring feature was accurate. I had always thought I'd slept well but the Band never recorded a score above the low 70's and mostly recorded a score in the 40's.I rate the phone app as a good. Lots of info and some innovative features I never got around to (tone & body fat). Lots of information to sort through to follow up on your interests.I guess I should be happy it died now versus after the free subscription period ended, neh?Overall, if it hadn't died I'd have probably tried to integrate it into my life and may have continued with the subscription. However with the hardware failure I now find the technology suspect (i.e., were the sensors accurate and providing realistic assessments of my activity)?Better luck with yours.UPDATE - Amazon Customer Service contacted me regarding this review to inform me that there is in fact a warranty (6 months?) on the Halo Band even though the Amazon return period is a month. They're shipping me a new one and I will return the one that died. Thanks Amazon Customer Service.",5
408,"I use primarily for sleep tracking, as I am an insomniac. The device has been very helpful in demonstrating my chaotic sleep stages, but for the last few days it has been confused: I go to bed at about midnight and go to sleep immediately. I wake the first time between two and four hours later (usually). From there, it is an unpredictable roller coaster. The problem is that Halo decides that my sleep period starts about 3:30 a.m. This leads to miscalculations. I cannot edit that time. Other days, my sleep time is counted as sedentary time. I cannot determine a pattern that would explain the errors. There is no avenue to report the issue. This is the problem with good and useful products: we like them and expect them to work just so. And when they don't, and there's no one to tell, it's doubly disappointing.Otherwise, an excellent product that enhances life.",4
409,"I used a band since “early bird access”, roughly 5-7 months. I decided to write this review, because I went snowboarding and the sensor on a band got lost somewhere on the mountain. Hence, the quality of the sensor housing and hinges completely suck.Pros:1. Intuitive and easy to understand iOS application.2. Pretty accurate body fat functionality3. Lots of programs (labs): diets, exercises, sleep training, meditation, etc. It looks like they keep adding to it.4. Sleep tracking is awesome and damn accurate.Cons:1. Materials of the band and sensor are very-very low quality2. There isn’t an option to “start” work out manually. Artificial intelligence is not doing a good job at this time figuring out if a person is working out. Also it is does not know if I am doing HIIT workout, or running.3. There is no integration with iOS Health app, or Nike Running Club..4. It takes at least a minute to position a charger inside the clip in such a way that it starts charging. A lot of times I would connect the band to a charger and leave it for an hour or so. I come back later finding out that it was not charming at all, because the band was positioned slightly off the charging points.Closing comments.I feel like it has a huge potential, but there is so much that needs to be fixed and improved",3
410,"This watch is amazing!  It is unique in that, rarely can you find one thing that is not advertised as many things.  In one thing, wanting to be many things, it can oftentimes be pretty decent in one or two but overall, a disappointment.For Amazon's Halo Watch, by focusing on health and not allowing itself to have an area for the gadgets and stuff, it excels beyond measures and anything I could have imagined.  My sleep is challenged by insomnia.  Medicine helps-ish, but it is difficult for me to say or explain how my sleep actually is.  Even more challenging for me to share that kind of information with a doctor.  I have done a study in the past and any reading this that has had that kind of thing be necessary in their life, understands the extreme nature of the costs.  Well, I can see a watch and technology like this working to curb those costs and make healthy living more accessible and healthcare more equitable.The watch can keep track of your temperature, the different stages of your sleep, and the length of time it takes one to fall asleep.  Invaluable information to a doctor trying to assist someone like myself.  There are features in which you take a picture of your body and go around as we all know, B.M.I. does not account for cultural bodies nor the fact that muscle weighs more than fat.  I have had doctors, in the past, reading a paper and say, ""Well, it looks like you are obese,"" and then look up and say something like, ""Obviously, that does not apply.""I would highly, highly, highly, recommend this watch.  My family has a history of high blood pressure and this watch will be excellent in our fight for healthy living.  This watch is a much-needed asset regarding health.",5
411,"I've been wearing Halo for a few months now. Overall it's a pretty good product, though I do hope it has a few design changes down the road. I enjoy the sleep tracking feature, but I find it uncomfortable to sleep in. The design is bulky compared to my smart watch. I wear my Samsung and Halo at the same time to compare. The Halo registers more steps by the end of the day, so it's seems to be more sensitive when tracking steps. It also syncs up with my WW app, which was a big selling point for me. I haven't used the body scan or tone feature, so I can't comment on those. A single charge lasts about three to four days, which is a plus.Because there's no display, you have to log in to see your steps. This definitely gives my smart watch an edge. I can see the time, date, my steps, miles, and calories burned. I can log my water, calorie intake, etc, all without having to log into the app. Down the road, if Halo is redesigned, I'd like to see more features that would resemble a smart watch.Overall I think it's a pretty solid product and look forward to some upgrades in the future.",4
412,"My Halo was working fine until I went away on vacation in December and forgot my charger. Once I got home and charged my device, it was never the same. I’ve lost some weight, so it didn’t fit right on my wrist and I had difficulty getting it to such even though everything was connected. The “icing” on the cake happened this week when the device burned my wrist. I wore it to a Spin class and again, it wouldn’t synch. When I got home, I noticed the mark on my wrist and thought at first it was dirt. Then I realized it was a burn. I never got my device wet. I checked the device and it appeared to have some burn damage. I threw the device away as I was disgusted with it. I should’ve kept it and mailed it back to Amazon with this review.  I’m afraid to get another one. It was fun while it worked. I still couldn’t figure out the body fat percentage. It was too high for my frame. Will be looking for another option for tracking steps, heart rate and sleep.",3
413,"I've tried Halo, Fitbit Inspire HR, and Whoop over the last few months. I returned my Halo. It was fine but at this point not as good as fitbit.The halo is much more comfortable to wear than whoop but otherwise very similar in design. Because they don't have screens, both halo and whoop let you view real time heart rate information in the app, which worked fine for me.For the body fat information, I thought it was interesting. The biggest problem is that, while it says it's better than weight for measuring health, it can't be calculated without weight. I already have a scale that measures my body fat and that halo can't actually replace that was a negative.I found the speech feedback more of a negative than a positive. First, it doesn't work very well. It would pick up podcasts I was listening to and I couldn't delete it. Then it wouldn't pick up me actually talking. The biggest negative was how quickly it drains the battery. Amazon will need to develop an easier way to charge like whoop has if this product is going to be successful. It drained at least twice as quickly as my fitbit and took at least twice as long to charge. It's a problem for something you're supposed to wear all the time.I wore this simultaneously with my fitbit and found halo's HR readings while exercising, especially HIIT or similar with bursts of activity weren't great. There was a significant lag in halo reading the increased activity. Halo would say that my heart rate was stuck at 120 when it was already 150, for example.The sleep tracking was good and similar to fitbit. From my time using whoop I have come to really appreciate HRV as a overall health data point. This information is available with fitbit with a premium subscription but not with halo.I liked the app and definitely like it better than Fitbit but not as much as whoop.There were many exercise classes you could access through the app. They looked very high quality but I already have an exercise routine that works for me and didn't use them.From my perspective this is very much a First Gen product that will need revisions and updates over time. For me it's not yet at a point to replace my fitbit so I returned mine.",2
414,Maybe it’s just me but I think they should make current blood pressure come up on main screen.,4
415,"Some of the biggest selling points for me when I submitted to be a first look purchaser are some of the things that I'm most unhappiest with.  I miss having a ""watch"" the feel is there, but then, I automatically go to look at the  watch, there is nothing there.  The need to look at my phone for any/all information is a little frustrating, I kind of like having the information at my fingertips and the ease of connecting my text/emails to come to my wrist.  I  do love the body scan feature (even through the embarrassment of taking a picture in my unhealthy state)  the biggest selling point for me was the ability to monitor my tone as I am a telephone operator and figured that would be a useful tool in my arsenal but I can't get it to work, no matter what I do, fully charged phone and band or  sitting in a quite room with nothing going far away from any other blue tooth item, still nothing.  so that makes me sad.  As far as the App, there is plenty of  information right at  your fingertips and even more if you go digging and as for the accuracy, I think it's pretty close as I now wear a 2nd band  (doesn't look too bad, they sit right next to each other, just looks like a larger wrist watch) but they come in very close to each other as far as number of steps and such.  The one thing I have found through my years is I put it (them) on my non dominate hand and note that it's on my dominant hand, I feel that it get a little closer to accuracy as it doesn't pick up some of my exaggerated hand movements.",5
416,"I wanted to take a break from my Apple Watch. Wanted to disconnect while still being able to track health related items. I found 2 things kind of annoying.The one thing that I didn’t think would really bother me, but DEFINITELY does is that it doesn’t have a clock face.. for $100, I don’t want to pull my phone out or have a watch on as well to tell the time. I have a lot of meetings at work so I always need an eye on time. Not asking for a screen here, literally any form of clock face would be niceThe other recommended improvement comment I’d have is they need to make a widget with iPhones or somewhere where you can more quickly just glimpse at everything being trackedThe BMI is cool, seems pretty legit there, the sleep tracking seems REALLY dialed in and the activity tracking seems solid as well, it figures out what you’re doing without having to do anythingThe voice piece I’m still messing around with. I think it’s accurate, hasn’t said anything that really surprised me",4
417,"I have been wearing Halo since Nov. 28, 2020 and so far the Halo is working well. Somethings to think about. Sleep tracker: If you lay on the Halo, meaning on your arm sometimes it does not track. Tone tracker: This is a fun little extra, however it uses a lot of energy. So if you leave it on, as I do, you will need to charge your Halo daily. Body Scan: takes a little work to get the picture, you have to stand exactly how diagram shows or the app won't register and take picture, but once done nice feature. The activity tracker and most important part seems pretty accurate for tracking walking/steps. If you exersise other than walking, as I do, it tracks based on body movements and heart rate, so not completely accurate, if you lift weights, or do yoga etc. The ""live"" part of the app that tracks your heart rate and tone of voice during a specific conversation is a fun and helpful extra. The Labs are iteresting I've looked at them, but haven't used any. I love that the Halo syncs with Weight Watchers app this was one of the reasons I chose it. However the sleep data does not transfer not sure why. All in all I am pretty happy with this product.",4
418,"For Amazon's first go at a fitness tracker, this is an excellent product. It measures sleep accurately and reflects different sleep cycles, which I have never seen another tracker do. The heart rate monitor is accurate and useful. I like the approach of earning ""fitness points"" for the week rather than just counting steps; it gives me more motivation to work out! The tone analysis is my favorite feature by far, as it tracks key points throughout your day and analyzes your tone. It has helped me to be more conscious of my mood and how I come across to others. This is especially important in 2020 when my work is remote and all of my interactions are either over the phone or on video chat, where body language is impossible or difficult to read. The body composition tool is interesting, but is not quite as personalized as I would like. For example, I am overweight and carry a lot of weight in my chest. The composition tool doesn't reflect that, but rather gives me a more standard view of what someone of my weight/height looks like. My body type is not ""typical,"" so this could be improved.Few things that could make this review 5 stars:-Better battery life-Display/watch screen-Vibration to remind me to move/to set alarms",4
419,"I was excited to try this device out when it went on sale during prime days. Unfortunately, it's algorithms are not well suited for my lifestyle as an international cabin steward. It assumes my rest breaks are idle time, and sleep shames me for not sleeping at all through the night. While the voice recognition feature seemed cool, it doesn't seem very sophisticated and I don't find it useful. I doubt I will use this past it's complimentary trial period.",3
420,"I have had this band for over 2 months. I have not experienced one problematic issue that the other reviewers mentioned.Sync time is mere seconds to my iphone, every time.Placing the unit in the charger is easy and I found if you give the clamp a gentle squeeze it connects quickly and easily every time.I charge mine while I shower and that keeps it nearly topped off.The Tone monitoring didn’t seem right at first. I felt like I had resting b* voice and didn’t sound very nice. Then I read that you can change the setting so it listens more frequently to give you a better idea of how you truly sound to others. That gave me a much better report. Yes, the Tone monitoring drains the battery faster, so you have to charge it more frequently. If you don’t need that feature everyday, just turn Tone off.The body scan is accurate and I feel if you’re getting this band to start your fitness journey it’s a great measurement tool to show where you start and to see your progress.The sleep monitoring is a great tool to measure the quality of sleep. It’s spot on as far as my experience has been. The tips for getting better sleep are also helpful if you find you need them.The Activity monitoring is great! I love the way the ‘scoring’ is set up and how they offer links to workouts and suggestions to get more activity in each day.The live data view is also good for heart rate monitoring during workouts if you’re just starting out or just want to see where you’re at when exerting yourself.It’s not much bulkier than a regular watch, and it’s held up well. I have the fabric band and it’s not showing any wear.",5
421,"It’s comfortable! It’s pretty, the app is amazing. So many tools for bettering your life or weight loss. Yummy recipes, great sleep tools, and more! I have no complaints so far. I’ve had Apple Watch and the top Fitbit. Both I was not very impressed with. This one right away I fell in love. I get it’s not for everyone, but don’t make it seem like it’s awful just cause it’s not for you. I see some reviews where people say they have to mess with the charger 20 times… they must be kinda dumb. Cause uh.. it takes me one time. As long as you have common sense it’ll be easy. The band also charges super quick which I think is wonderful. I see some say rashes but understand not everyone will react the same way you guys did. I say try it & if it’s not for you return it. Amazon is great with customer service! So far there is nothing I don’t like. I love it. I even plan on buying another but in pink. That is all! Try it! 😄",5
422,"I was skeptical about having a band without a face, but to my surprise, I find I now prefer that.  The app is really well done, with very good tie-ins to partners with (to me at least) novel approaches to sleep and exercise.  Having the focus be on weekly points has been really helpful for me.I've had the device about a month now, and it stopped tracking sleep correctly the last 3 nights, missing large blocks of time.  I contacted support, and they gave pretty basic, non-helpful canned answers.  So unfortunately, I'll quit using it now.The battery life is only 2 days if you have ""tone analysis"" set up.  I found that to be a gimmick, and not important, but I couldn't find a way to turn that off once it's set up.  It so happens I got a new phone a week ago, and I didn't add tone analysis support, and my battery life has doubled to 4 days.The body scans I have mixed feelings about.  It does feel kind of invasive, but it does also give a visual record for me to see progress.  I could see some people might choose to not use this.",4
423,"I was included in the pre-release of the Halo, and have been using it ever since it arrived.I really like the accompanying app. It is well thought through and has several nice option my Fitbit watch doesn’t have.However, the battery life of this device is simply horrible.If I activate all options in the app, the battery life is less than 24 hours.Like most of us, I live a very busy life, and having to charge a tracking device more than once a day, to get accurate results is nearly impossible.I really like the idea behind the Halo, and it would be a really great device, if it was not for the really poor battery performance.I believe in the long run this will be the reason this “fitness” tracker will never be a serious competition to other products on the market that have a battery life of 3 days or longer.I am very disappointed that battery life was obviously not a serious consideration (it should have been), when developing this device.I don’t see what good it does to have really great options available on the accompanying app, when I have  to throttle or disable these app options to save on battery life.This item definitely needs a serious overhaul in terms of longevity of use, before the developers can even dream of competing with other devices of the kind.The extremely short battery life makes it overpriced.",3
424,"First, i think the Halo app isn't very Samsung friendly as i've had a LOT of issues with the Tone of Voice feature with that device. It just never seems to work when I prompt it to. I get an error 90% of the time.Otherwise, the sleep data is really great. The workout tracking is decent. HR monitoring is decent, but i wish you could bookmark or take notes during certain points. Sometimes when I have anxiety it registers as workout activity, and i'd like to be able to mark those areas and either change them or just be able to mark that data for health reasons.The design could be modified. Its a little nubby device that clips a strap over top to secure it to your wrist. Which means it always kind of hurts or it's not tight enough to capture the relevant data. Admittedly I have small boney wrists, but I never had this issue with any fitbit. comfort is a definite issue as i find myself adjusting it all the time or taking it off to give my wrist a break during the day (and then forgetting to put it back on).",4
425,"I've had several different fitness watches and this one is the best of the ""bare bones"" types because the price is far superior to others. I prefer to go about my day and workouts and review data at the end of the day, so the fact that the watch doesn't have a screen really doesn't affect me at all. I have a Fitbit Charge 4 and it is extremely similar to the Halo other than presence of a screen (and the screen barely shows much and is not very customizable anyway). The apps provide nearly identical info, and I actually prefer the Halo's workout points system and found it more motivating than seeing calories burned. I also prefer the Halo's workout video additions- the HIIT one's are my favorite. I also found the body fat analysis pretty accurate and consistent. The voice recognition thing is cool.. a bit of a novelty, but it did make me realize that my tone is very negative most of the day, so now I actively try to improve it.When comparing to something like an Apple watch, this is where you see big differences. I really liked being able to connect my Bluetooth earbuds to my Apple watch so my phone didn't have to be strapped to me during a run. Also, the screen and the bands on the Apple watch are super customizable and I think Halo should really offer more band options. I can't really get ""attached"" to a watch that has few band options. Right now, the styles are extremely limited and Amazon is the only one providing additional bands. I will say I love the unique velcro they use on the woven bands but the lighter colors get grimey.",5
426,"The concept is cutting edge and advanced but at the same time, I feel like I am giving something up with this activity tracker. One example is the tracking of sleep and steps. I've found both to be rather inaccurate. I ran a trial comparing the readings of the Halo, Fitbit Charge HR, and Fossil Venture Q Gen 4. All three had different readings however the Fitbit and Fossil had similar readings and the Halo was reading far more steps and less sleep. Regarding the app: the body measurement function is nice however how accurate is it really? The heart rate monitor is dead on based on compared measurements from the band, a finger pulse reader, and an electronic blood pressure monitor. To my disappointment, there is no log of your heart rate in the app. You have to change your weight measurement in the settings of the app, unlike other apps where you can easily track it along with other measurements. One feature I find to be useless is the ""Tone"" function. It drains the battery in 24 hours. I've kept it off since the 2nd day of having the Halo. It doesn't sync up with any apps other than WW and John Hancock Vitality. After using it for awhile, I've decided I am probably going to return the Halo. Though I waited in anticipation to be chosen to be able to purchase it, I feel that I could have gotten better use out of my money.",3
427,"Tracker keeps me active, body scan reminds me to make progress , great yoga videos for free.",4
428,I like the Amazon Halo a lot. It could use some improvements but overall I think it does what I expect it to.I like:- Comfortable - I hardly notice I am wearing it most of the time- No display (don't need it)- Options and data it tracks- Speed of charging and length that band stays charged- Reliability and usefulness of info providedWhat I don't like/think needs improvement- Charger - it takes a lot of maneuvering to get the halo into the right position in the clip so it is actually charging. Very frustrating when it takes me 5 minutes or more like it did this morning.- Stupid green light on the side that randomly flashes during the night. It wakes me up if my arm is near my face and has even woken my husband up. Why would you have it do something like that? Super annoying!- Tone tracking needs to be improved. It seems to miss a lot of conversations and a lot of nuance.Overall I feel it was worth going for the early release on this item - I expect newer versions will improve some of the issues.,4
429,"when you lose nearly a year of data. I loved mine and even got a free replacement when it broke, but after an hour with tech support I can't get my old data nor record anything new with the replacement. It seems simple but it's not, it's really glitchy and getting data and getting it to connect was frequently a problem. I realize they probably weren't just being nice by giving me the free replacement, they want the $4 a month. Frequently the solution to a problem is to reset the device and that erases all your data.",2
430,"This band seemed interesting because it was different than things I’ve seen on the market and a unique alternative to my Apple Watch. For starters it’s not a watch at all just a band used to track metrics such as sleep tracking, body fat, tone of voice, activity and intensity, and can provide your heart rate. This band does what a lot of the smart watches and activity trackers on the market already do without any type of screen. The product is nothing super special. Mine arrived and I had to take a wipe to it immediately because it did not look clean. Mine came with a pink bank which was dirty after the first day of wearing it 24 hours. Bands should be more resistant to stains and dirt. Trackers works fine but I am not sure how accurate the sleep tracker is or the activity tracker. I did the same workout 2 days in a row and they were recorded differently as are as intensity and I was given a 15 point difference between those days even after accounting for points being taken away for sedative activity. The tone feature only picks up some things and can not accurately compute your tone throughout the day. The band is awkward to wear 24 hours to get the results from the features of the band. Also after 6 months you have to pay for app so I don’t think this is worth it. Stick with your other devices.",3
431,"I really wanted to like this band, but its pretty much unusable for its core purposes.The good:- The band itself is unobtrusive and very comfortable relative to other options on the market (the only reason that I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1)- The mobile app UX is pretty clean, at least by Amazon standards. Setup was simple and fast, but would love an option to hide all the extra noise (no seriously, I don't ever need to see a video for a barre class for the rest of my existence, please let users opt out of those features)- Sleep tracking seemed to work well, but given the other issues I have on data quality (noted below) I just don't trust any of what its reporting frankly.The bad:- App will stop tracking steps somewhat randomly. This seems to happen most often after I start using my AirPods to listen to music or make a call. During this period of no step tracking, the battery drains at a significantly higher rate than normal. Clearly a bug on the embedded firmware side.- When steps tracking is actually working, it wildly overcounts steps. For an experiment, I wore a fitbit and a gobe3 on the same wrist on different days side by side with the halo to compare. On average, the halo was off by a factor of 2 in most cases. There was a day where I only left my apartment to do a short walk with my dog (less than 20m) and the app suggested that I walked 12k steps. My iPhone reported less than 5k.- The algorithm they use to quantify calorie impact from activity is wildly overtuned. The anecdote I shared about of step overcounting led to the halo app telling me I burned 3500 kcals in a single day. This is physiologically impossible for me to do on a day where im almost entirely sedentary.Conclusion: Don't buy this if you care about data accuracy, it needs a ton of work. Wait for the next generation, maybe they'll figure it out",2
432,Been wearing for months! Many PROs and a few CONS for Amazon to improve on.ProsSleep tracking has been superior to Samsung sleep teacher in Galaxy 2 watch. My husband has compared many nights and we think the breakdown between deep and REM is better on Halo. Also - we really actually enjoy the tone of voice feature. As parents to small kids (and for married life) it has been both neat and helpful to check in on our tone of voice and it seems pretty accurate. It was buggy at first with connection to app (esp with tone) but it did improve. I find it comfortable and my husband does too. We have the fabric and it has been stain resistant (have used baby wipes when it gets a stain).ConsThe battery life needs improving - big time. When they fix this.... we will likely upgrade as getting just shy of a day on each charge is pretty terrible. But I tend to charge it for 90 mins before bed. The light that can sometimes be visible with these types of watches... when you move while trying to sleep... can be a bit distracting.,4
433,"The Halo is amazing. I love all of the features and have enjoyed it since last October. Today my waterproofing band / the seal on the sensors came off. I've never worn it in the shower or gone swimming with it. I always make sure to wipe it down so it doesn't stay moist after a run or bike ride.Today I called customer service and they offered a refund which was nice but I bought it during the Beta test so... to buy another one would be more than I initially paid. The rep, although extremely helpful and kind said they could not offer a replacement. They also tried to say it was outside of the return window and I had to point them to their terms and conditions.Here, below, are the actual warranty Terms and conditions below which are different from the return or support policies offered on your order status.https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GV4G6T9W9D5T65Y3Specifically paragraph two.Awesome product amazon. Love it. Just wish it lasted a bit longer and the T/C's weren't quite so difficult to find for consumers and employees.",4
434,"I've had my halo now for just over one month.  I like having the ability to add activities like weightlifting.  I lift 5 or 6 days a week for 60 - 90 minutes, and it does challenge me to continue adding points to my activity score.  I also like the body scan and composition.  I've used a popular brand scale for Body Fat % and the results are inconsistent and not always accurate.The first couple of weeks, I liked the sleep score and recognized I needed to w ork on getting a better more restful sleep.  Unfortunately, it no longer provides and accurate score.  I believe there was a software update and that may be the culprit.  My scores originally were in the 60's.  Now they are single digit to nothing at all.  Most nights it shows me falling asleep at around midnight and I know I am falling asleep between 9 and 9:30.  I wake every morning between 3 and 4, and it may show me being awake at 2, thus the very low score.  I don't feel any less rested, so I'm certain the information is inaccurate, and hoping there will be an update soon to correct this issue.",4
435,"So far so good. Got it as soon as presale started, had it since 10/29/20 (Medium size, black onyx, fabric strap). Don’t have too much use for the labs.  Halo band is good though. Really like that it works in the background, meaning it has none of the distractions of smart watches. No display, no notifications, etc. Accurate pulse rate, verified/compared with my polar heart monitor. Would have really liked a better strap. Hard to clean well, since you can’t remove the sensor from the strap. Material is also itchy after a while (maybe just me). Velcro secures nicely, but can’t open strap all the way. This makes it a little difficult to remove over the hand. See 2nd pic.  Had trouble with charging time, but Amazon customer service helped by walking through a software update, which solved the issue.  Not sure why the update didn’t happen automatically or why app didn’t notify me that one was needed/available. Not thrilled about the type of charger required (included of course). Really do like the voice and sleep quality analysis. Body scan is ok, but I’m probably not hyped with that feature since most of us aren’t thrilled to see our body shape, ha!All in all, happy with my halo.",4
436,"First of all let me mention how stupidly picky people are with products. There is nothing out there that is going to be perfect and track every tiny aspect of your life.This Amazon Halo band is the best I’ve tried yet. It is very cool with its abilities. The sleep function is my favorite. It is very detailed and gives you suggestions and ways to help your sleep routine. The app gives you suggestions on recipes and how to meditate and keep moving daily. I have yet to set up the Tone, Movement, or Body sections of the band and I love it! I know when I set those up that my feelings and ratings will only increase. It is water proof which is a plus.The only negative aspect I have of this band is that it is a tad uncomfortable.  The monitor itself is a little awkwardly shaped and doesn’t feel too good when it gets out of place. But after a few days of wearing it I have gotten used to it.I also saw a review on here about the charger and how it was the most difficult charger ever. I’m not sure what this person is doing wrong but it is beyond easy!! Plus I’ve been wearing this band for 4 days straight and the battery is still about 50%.The lack of screen is a major plus for me! It is sleek and definitely less distracting!!",5
437,"Have had this since November and am giving it up. Thoughts - I like the minimalness, keeps you from being obsessed with it. I find the sleep tracking to be decent. It doesn't match my bed, but I actually feel like it is more accurate. I didn't care about any of the activity functions. I will say that while I think Amazon's activity tracking is unique, not being able to ""compete"" with your friends and their step counts is a negative that Amazon won't overcome. I did the body scan once and it felt accurate. Didn't really care. The feature I cared about, and why I got it was voice rec. I think it works really well. Two problems, not enough samples to be useful, and without knowing for sure what convo spurred what rating, it is not that useful.What has killed it for me is this. If you let it die by accident, the only way it will recharge is resetting everything and starting over. While a pain, it wouldn't be the end of the world if it pushed your data back down from the cloud. It doesn't, so you are starting fresh everytime you run out of power.For me, it isn't useful enough to make me recharge it everytime I get a notice its getting low, so, just not for me. Not an awful product.",3
438,"I’ve had a Halo since day one. Although I don’t use voice tracking I did use it to determine when I was sounding bitchy. This has lots of wonderful features. I love all the things available in the app. It covers all aspects of a healthy life style from activity, sleep, mindset and food. I bought it because of the partnership with WW but it isn’t as interactive with WW as I would like. I also miss a few things from my last monitor. My first unit lasted 8 months before it would not take a charge. Since it was under the one year warranty Amazon replaced it. The replacement has now lasted 8 months. The back fell off. The back that essentially makes it water resistant. So both broke at exactly the eight month mark. This replacement however is not covered under warranty so I need a new one. I am trying one more time with the 2nd generation model. I purchased the extended warranty just in case.",3
439,"So I really like the no display side of things. The voice recognition is not good. On days where I watched TV, and never spoke, it said I spoke quite a bit. Sleep tracking seems to be more accurate than what I am used to. I enjoy having the live display in front of my TV when I am doing a workout so I can see my heart rate. It takes a while to charge. If you use voice, expect it to take about 30 minutes a day to charge, because it uses half the battery or more when you use voice. Speaking of charging... that is hit or miss with the charging cable. I don't know why we don't just all go to magnetic or wireless charging. This clamp is not good. I have had many times where I have to squeeze the charger to get it started. Once it starts it is great, but getting it to start is hit or miss. I am torn because what it does well, it does extremely well. What it doesn't do well...is extremely aggravating. I doubt I will keep using it after the subscription.",4
440,"Overall, I love it. It's not intrusive like some bands I've worn in the past. I like that there's no face on it, so I'm not constantly checking monitoring my steps. It's easy enough to forget the band is even there. I love all the labs we get with it and mostly use the ones that are offered for sleep.I've seen where some one else had an issue with the points - I have an issue reaching them, but that's because my job is sedentary and I live somewhere that gets a real winter. Spring is here, so being outside will be easier outside of work hours to make up my points. I'm working on finding ways to get my daily count higher. That's on me.There's ONE thing I'm not happy with. The linking with other apps. I'm currently signed up for a fitness program through my insurance/employer and I can't sync this band with their app to count my steps. There's very limited options for syncing the app with outside apps and so it's not useful to me this way. :(  PLEASE expand our options for linking with other apps!",4
441,"So far so good.  I've owned and used several fitness trackers/smart watches over the years, and they have all been either just ok as a watch and great as a tracker, or the other way around.  I made the decision to ditch smart watches, go back to a traditional watch, and find myself a simple, low profile tracker.  The halo seems to be fitting the bill.  Its small, comfortable to wear (I bought a rubber sport band with it and have only used that)  and it's easy to use.  As long as you really read up on how it works, and understand the scoring process I see no problems.  I've seen some comments about it being ""demotivating"" because it subtracts points after to many hours of being sedentary, but that makes sense!  If you get up and work out in the morning and get the heart going but then sit the rest of the day, it negates that workout.  I've also seen reviews saying people are running and working out and only getting a few points for it.  That means either you are not wearing it tight enough to register your heart rate or you aren't getting your heart rate up.The tone feature is cool, and seems to work pretty well, but it eats the battery super fast.  I'd use it more, but I don't want to have to charge it every night.I included a pic of my first week's progress just to show the scoring.  This is points earned by just moving around, mowing my yard, and day to day stuff.  No work out.",5
442,"My husband ordered it for me as I have been wanting to track my daily activities and sleep. I've never had a fitness tracker besides Google Fit app on my phone. It's very inconvenient to be carrying my phone while doing activities.  But I've been pushing myself to exercise using workout apps since WFH has gotten me sitting all day long. My workout apps aren't compatible with halo (I wish it did) but it tracks my activities and heartrate. I thought the body scan to see body fat percentage was a pretty cool feature but I think it is programmed to tell the user he/she is too fat.I found that I sleep better and feel more rested with the halo on. Looking at time recorded, I think it's pretty accurate. It recorded whenever I had disturbances which I'm well aware of. It doesn't record naps but it recorded when I overslept. I woke up at 11am this past weekend and it's there!I have the fabric band. I like that it is washable. I put in a net and air dry and it's good as new.Overall, even though it tells me I'm TOO fat and I know I'm not, I still like my halo.",4
443,"I don't like to be distracted by all kinds of notifications from a smartwatch, but I like to get some information like step count, sleep pattern and so on. So, Amazon Halo band is perfect for my life style. I like the clean and easy look of Halo app as well. Sleep pattern tracking is superb! I am not sure if body fat % is accurate or not. The number is off by 3% compared to my weight scale.I have three suggestions for the band.1. Heart rate monitoring: I don't want to measure my heart rate all the time. User should be able to turn on and off the function. It look like a green LED is always on while I wear my band. I hope that the updated app offers an option to manually turn off the function.2. Charger: Charger clip is not popular any more. When I insert my band to the clip, I need to wiggle it to adjust the band position so that it can start charging. Amazon should consider a magnet type charging dock for the next version.3. Band: I hope to see more band choices including silicon ones.Overall, this is a good fitness band and has lots of potentials.",4
444,"I love this band for tracking my fitness goals and sleep!Yes, it feels like the first version of a product... because it is.The band itself is extremely comfortable and fits my tiny wrists without being too bulky. I can barely feel it on my wrist. I LOVE the lack of screen. I don't need more distractions throughout my day.  I can wear this knowing I can track my fitness at my convenience without something interrupting me.As others have mentioned, the charger needs work. It's difficult to line up the band in the exact position needed to charge.  You have to pay attention to the light indicator, or else it might not charge properly.The app itself is great and easy to use.  The activity and sleep data can be analyzed on daily, weekly, or monthly time intervals.  You can also track your weight and measure you body fat, which is very useful.I have not used the tone feature, but it may be something I try in the future.Overall, I think this is a solid entry into the fitness band market. I love my Halo and can't wait for additional upgrades!",4
445,"I originally wrote a review that was only four stars because the device kept erasing my workout information. But I had a great experience with Amazon customer service and they helped me fix the problem right away. I like it much more than my Apple watch or Fitbit. (I included a pic with both Apple watch and Halo so you can see the comparison.) It's comfortable and I love the fact that it doesn't have a face. I look forward to the day when the hardware is even thinner and smaller.I strangely love the point system. I didn't think I would, but the points do actually encourage me to get more exercise. I think the sleep tracking is decent - though I will say that I hate wearing it at night because I don't like the sensation on my wrist when I'm sleeping. But you do get used to it. I definitely love the body scanning technology to measure body fat. I don't use Tone at all. I did it for a day, but I know what I sound like. I can see it being useful though if someone was unsure of how they were coming off.I hope that Amazon will allow it to be used in other apps, like Noom. Noom works seamlessly with Apple Health and it would be nice if there were a Halo integration. But for now, I just take my step count from Halo and manually put it into Apple Health.Overall, if you're looking for an unobtrusive fitness tracker with some nifty bells and whistles, this does a great job!",5
446,"I’m not really a fan of this. I’m not sure if it’s just because it’s still in beta, but I’m disappointed. The sleep tracker doesn’t work great for me—I read in bed before going to sleep and it thinks I’m asleep or trying to sleep all the time so it affects my sleep score.Next, the tone feature is very weird—it drains the battery very quickly and I’m honestly not sure what the advantage of knowing that at 11:14 am, my tone was “annoyed, frustrated, or stubborn”. By the end of the day when I’m looking at it, I don’t remember who I was talking to at 11:14 or what we were talking about. Also, if you’re singing, it gets confused and rates your tone—energetic, happy, etc. For some reason, it has stopped listening to my tone altogether, which I don’t really mind in reality, but according to the app, it is still supposed to be listening in.The rest of the app with exercises and suggestions on how to get better sleep and stuff is pretty useful, but I don’t know if it’s worth the subscription fee that’s going to be attached in a few months.I don’t have a smart watch or other fitness tracker, and I’m kind of disappointed that this is the one I went with. I expected more from Amazon here, and I don’t know that I would recommend this for anyone else, at least not yet.",3
447,"It's okay. My favorite part by far is that it tells you the quality of your movement as opposed to just counting steps. Love that and I really wish it was something that all fitness trackers did.I got this tracker SPECIFICALLY for the tone and body composition parts though and I have to admit that I never used either beyond the first week. It was cool to see things like ""you sounded confused/happy/loving"" and such, but I felt like the information I got from it was useless since I tend to understand how I am feeling anyway. I wish they would have more insights into the tone rather than ""you sounded happy at 4:28.""I absolutely hate the charger. It takes so many tries to get the tracker on *just right* so that the gods align and the tracker charges.I also would like if they made it so that when you press the button it would tell you the time. I don't want it on all the time or to be blinded by light when I roll over in the middle of the night, but it would be useful if I could press a button and know what time it is.To end on a positive note: I also really like the sleep tracker and how the app grades your sleep",3
448,"I was excited to see Amazon getting into the fitness wearable game. However, I am now disappointed.The tone analysis was the feature I was looking forward to the most. But even when you put that on the high setting, it measures your tone at odd and sporadic times. So if you're not speaking when it decides to capture your voice, you may have very few readings at all. When it does capture your voice, it does it in rapid succession. For example, your only reading for the entire day may be between 09:20:07 and 09:20:59 with a wide range of tone readings within that less than one minute.I was also really excited about the body composition feature. Based on how Amazon hyped it up, I was under the impression I can finally get an analysis closer to a BodPod or something similar. Nope. Short story on this, the technology is simply not there to compete with sophisticated readings you get from in-person analysis like the BodPod.Additionally, the activity measurements are wildly off and inconsistent. I will concede that data from jogging/running routes are pretty much spot on. However, once you get into workouts like weight training, HIIT, etc., nothing makes since. In one HIIT session, Halo measured 55 activity points. In a separate and very similar HIIT session (including similar hear rates based on my Garmin fitness watch and heart rate strap), Halo measured that activity at a whopping 5 points. This can be problematic for people new to working out and needing some quantifiable guidance or for those who are motivated by chasing points.I will say that the sleeping measurements appear to be better than the other wearables I have used. My Garmin Vivoactive 3 tends to start sleep time when I lay down for a little bit. Halo appears to more accurately measure when I actually fall asleep.This is a ""get what you pay for"" deal. About $100 is fairly cheap for fitness wearables/watches. The accuracy of the data reflects that price range. If you're looking for high-quality data, go with one of the established fitness watches. Personally, my Garmin watch gets the job done pretty well. I was just hoping Amazon would use it's status as a behemoth to set a new standard. I was wrong.",2
449,"I didn’t hate this product however I don’t feel the sleep tracking was very accurate and I would like to see the product have a clock added to it. I liked that it could read my pulse, the battery lasted for a week, the charger is easy to use, and how it measured your body BMI. I feel if this product could get some more advancements it would be worth purchasing. You can have a subscription to halo and I didn’t feel the subscription was worth the money at this time.",4
450,"The app sucks!  It constantly won’t sync, wont load info.  I keep seeing “try again”. Can’t upload data. Amazon account said I have a membership but the app says I don’t.  I had to factory reset and do everything all over again.  Takes about an hour to setup everything.  First day and not too happy, especially because the first one I ordered this it never showed up.  Ugh!  I’m disappointed so far with the setup process and the app.",3
451,"The band is comfortable and accurate.  The app is a little cluttered but easy to use. I love the no screen band but the charging cradle design is terrible.  It's strange and awkward, really hate the charging. It's fast when it works and charges last for almost r days if not using tone analysis.",3
452,"I’ve only been using the Amazon Halo for a couple of weeks now and I was fortunate enough they allowed me to take part in the early access. Being honest, I have not yet attempted to use the body fat measurement tool on the device yet. As for everything else, I love it. I was skeptical about the Halo not having a screen, but in the past I’ve been very focused and almost become obsessed with checking how many steps I had for the day when using other fitness bracelets. It’s been great not having to just be focused on steps even though the steps are being tracked in the background. That’s where the points tracking feature comes into play as well; you have to really look for your amount of steps that you took during the day and week because the focus more on the amount of activity you are getting in a day. I love that I can be focused more on seeing the real facts and realizing what I need to change when I’m not active. Next is the sleep feature - I always love this feature on any fitness technology and on the Halo it’s a great feature that works well. Don’t even get me started about the tone feature because I love that as well. It’s definitely the best feature of the Halo. It’s extremely accurate and I’ve seen it in multiple situations especially at work making me realize the way I come across towards my peers. The only downside with using tone frequently is that you do have to charge the Halo almost every day with my experience. Although this is a feature I’m sure they will improve with future versions and updates. Overall, if you’re thinking about purchasing the Halo it’s a great band and worth the purchase.",5
453,"I want to say that I DO like the Amazon Halo. It is simple enough for my needs, just a band, no screen that distracts me, and I really can't ask for more. There is only a few things that I care about in terms of tracking and this device does it for me (sleep, steps, calories, bpm). I like the points I get for being active and how it compares with other days or weeks. Again, simple.The deal breaker: The charger is not the best. Every time I charge my band I find myself fiddling with the band and charger until I get the right spot for it to start charging. It can be between 1-3 minutes and for me it is VERY annoying.Other than that, the device is great and has other features like the Tone and measuring body fat which I don't really use. I hope Amazon comes up with a better way to charge the device, otherwise I am just going to move to other options.",4
454,"I love this band so far!  Had it a couple of days and despite an initial hiccup (human error) I got my first sleep results this morning and I think they are “right on”. I love the fact that now instead of checking a bunch of different apps, I can get everything I want to know (sleep, heart, and activity) from this one device…that’s measured on my wrist not from apps on my phone. I’m not using the body scan yet because I’ve had that done two times already and I don’t need anything else to tell me about my BMI.  Besides Amazon’s own admission is that it likely inaccurate for those in the obese category. So I already planned to not use this component until I get down to the next lower “overweight “ category to test it out. Also have no plans to use the “tone” voice recognition. To me this component has no ranking on my overall health and is a waste of time to use or Amazon to spend energy developing. I much rather have a component in the app of tracking my food/calories  & water intake, to rank with the activity, sleep and BMI. This would then make this device all inclusive!!  Also allowing entries of time per day spent on meditation(reading,singing,playing an instrument) should be able to be added and weighted as a better indicator of mental health vs the tone of my voice. Sooooo Amazon, as others have said…. this is a great start…. but looking forward to better additions to really “kick-ass” other competitors!!!",5
455,"This would be a nice product if it did what it claims. The fact is, it is Amazon's first crack at competing with Fitbit, and it shows. I've owned and used both, and the Halo just doesn't keep up.To be sure, I'm not a big fan of the Fitbit, either. There are issues with accuracy in Fitbit products, too, and they are not very durable in my experience. But the very poor communication between the Halo app and the Halo band makes the product unreliable and frustrating. Troubleshooting guidelines suggest several remedies (e.g., be sure the button on the band is facing you; double press the band button to sync; refresh the app). None of these work to make the app reconnect to the band. You simply have to wait, sometimes hours, for the app and band to sync and to find out your stats for the day.Basically, the Halo will provide the data it claims, but you're going to have to be patient with all the first generation kinks that come from a very poorly designed app. Most folks want their exercise data in real-time, or as close to that as you can get, which the Halo claims to do. However, because of the problems in communication between band and app, it does not reliably do so.",3
456,"I want to love this so badly, but it’s just not making it easy.1. Battery life with tone off is still limited2. Bluetooth connection keeps dropping and I constantly have to reset the device to connect it, wiping all my tracked data in the process.3. I thought I would like not having the watch function, turns out I really miss it. I thought I’d enjoy it being a bracelet but it’s too large to wear with a watch, or another smart device that has what this ones missing4. Live feature for the heart rate is buried in the app and not easy to find when checking zonesPros:1. Sleep tracking is amazing, very detailed and the programs for relaxation are very helpful.2. It is accurate, but so it my Fitbit which has everything this tracker is missing.3. Tone really makes you aware of your voice and how you’re heard by others, which is important to me and I do value that. But the drain on the battery is no joke and you can expect to charge it every other day.4. The fit and weight of the device is hardly noticeable, and the water resistant was a huge plus for me.I like it, but it’s just not for me, I’m a busy body who’s always multitasking, so I feel like it’s just not paying rent but being multipurpose.",3
457,"The best feature hands down is the body fat tracker. Instead spending $70-$100 on a dexa scan every time or using inaccurate terrible bmi or ""smart"" scales, you get an accurate measure with Halo.It gives you the truth and helps you keep on track and know when you are plateauing. It is helpful for those who want to gain muscle and burn away the fat. I noticed immediately what works and what doesn't in terms of results. I had run many days of the week and saw great progress. Eventually however after a couple months and 6 pounds of body fat loss I realized I needed to make a change. I started weight lifting and discovered yet another drop. If I didn't have the halo I would have only lost ""4 lbs"" and wouldn't know. Since kept on track I can ""see"" the progress via old photos it's clear what I am losing and what I am gaining.The other feature I use is sleeping and I suck at sleeping. Though it's accuracy isn't great it's good enough.I've used fitbits and others and the fat feature and battery life smashes them all. Just wish subs $3.99 weren't so high. I appreciate the exercise videos though.",5
458,"Like the monitor very much.  Givescme the information I need.  It IS NOT waterproof,  so be careful when exercising.",4
459,"First and foremost, I love the halo band. I got it early access and compared it with my Apple Watch as well as a pulse ox for accuracy and find it to be very accurate. I also checked accuracy with my sleep times, etc and found it to be very accurate. The tone analysis is spot on too. I could tell when I was talking to my coworkers vs. when I was talking to my patients at work and that was really neat to see. So all and all I love it.With that being said, the battery life has become garbage. Several days in a row now I will charge it fully and wear it for less than five hours and the battery will die very quickly. I’ve had tone analysis on since I got it and have done nothing different in the last month but the battery life keeps getting worse and worse. I put it on before bed last night and it died 4 hours into sleeping after being fully charged. I’m going to try to turn tone analysis off and see if that improves the battery life some but the device is becoming useless to be blunt about it.",4
460,"I was a fitbit customer for many years. Their customer service is not what it used to be so I started looking for another option. I have a very small wrist and most trackers are too big. To my surprise this is the same time Amazon announced the Halo. I was invited to try it early and jumped at the chance. I've had my Halo for 7 months and was enjoying it.  The app is easy to use. It has several good features and the charge holds for about 6 or 7 days. I wore it most of the time, only taking it off when bathing or charging.  One morning I took it off to charge it and it literally fell apart. Just as others have shown in pictures, the rubber seal holding the plate came apart or unglued. It looked like it started to disintegrate on my wrist because I had about 7 pieces of the black rubber left on my arm when I took it off.  It did not get wet prior and I did not do anything I had not done previously. I am very disappointed and now have to start the search again for another tracker.  I won't purchase another Halo until they fix this issue.",3
461,"*UPDATE* I really like the device still, I am achieving health goals and am motivated to improve my health more, BUT apparently I am very allergic to nickel, so I will have to discontinue use. I hope they will release a nickel free version!This is the first fitness tracker I've had and I do like very much, I do feel that it is accurate in terms of steps and activity. It also seems to be pretty accurate with sleep tracking as well and I enjoy the labs to improve sleep quality. The labs are definitely one of my favorite features of the Halo.I really liked the Tone function of the Halo but it seems to have stopped working. I have tried changing settings between more and less time but, I have gone days with no updates at all even though I'm pretty sure that I've seen the microphone led flash periodically. I know that the microphone works because if I turn it on live I will get a tone analysis. The loss of this feature is definitely a disappointment.I have not used the body scan feature yet so I can't speak to that. Other than the tone function the only other thing I think could be improved is the availability of extra wristbands, I ordered the pink and have found that it gets dirty quickly, I wanted to order a new darker wristband but they have gone up in price and they will not ship for months.Overall I think that the Halo is just ok and probably not worth the cost of the unit and the membership, but if they work out some of the issues it could be worth the cost.",5
462,"I also have a Fitbit so I decided to try the Halo.Pros- I like that it doesnt have a screen to look at. Its comfortable. I also like the data navigation in the app. I seem to go over my points goal and it motivates me to be more active. I do like the voice recognition and makes me aware of how I sound when I am talking to different people. Some people clearly annoy me and this band tells me its true. I also like the BMI part although havent remeasured yet.Cons- kind of cumbersome to get on the charger. Also, I wish there was a way to add steps when I forget to wear my band. It does not connect with “My Fitness Pal’” app which is a bummer but hopefully will change in the future. And one more thing. For some reason I thought I could talk to it like my Auto Alexa and speak into the band. Like hey Alexa what time is it? That would be awesome and I think I wouldnt rely so much on my phone. All in all I still have it on. Four stars.",4
463,"UPDATE - Over time I have grown to REALLY dislike this device.  My original, initial review is below.  That focused on just the sleep tracking feature I was most interested in.  All of that first review is still very valid and true, but I've been using this for a few months now and there are several other points I really dislike as well.  Ive decided this was a waste of my money and effort and its time to start shopping around again……. ☹The tracker loses its connection all the time and sometimes I lose data.  I have a Galaxy Note 8, not a new phone, but definitely a pretty high-end phone, and it loses its connection often.  Sometimes it takes a reset of the tracker to solve the issue.  Not the reliability and bullet proof ease of use I would expect from an Amazon product.Charging is ANNOYING.  The charging connection is bulky, blocky, awkward, and only fits one VERY specific way.  Other less expensive devices just use a quick and simple magnetic connection the fits on fast in either direction.  As I said, THIS charger only fits in one very specific way and then once it’s in, sometimes it has to be fiddled with and adjusted and button pushed, and wiggled around and button pushed again, and sometimes taken out and the contacts wiped off, then back in the teeth the one specific way again with a little more wiggling around and pushing the button again..... and then the red light finally comes on and it starts charging!!  Why??  Why does it have to be THIS complicated Amazon?  Why does it HAVE to take SO long?  No data is passed, just a simple power connection..... why does this simple thing have to be SO annoying??*** First Review ***The main thing I was looking for was the sleep tracking feature.  On the positive side it does seem to track all the stages pretty accurately.  On the negative side though I'm just not happy at all with how the app displays the info.  It shows the actual bar graph of the times and stages as just ""last night"" then you can scroll back through the individual nights in storage.  What I REALLY would like much better is if it was displayed more as a stock chart style.  Show the whole 24 hours or week or month or year all on one continuous banded graph.  Just like with stocks this would make spotting trends and patterns much easier I think.  It already displays ""last night"" as a graph so just expand it out forever.  Maybe if I use the modules more Ill get more use out of this, but as of now Im just not happy with how its giving me my sleep info.",1
464,I really liked my band at first and everything worked well but lately it's been one issue after another. First it stopped syncing my steps with weight watchers app and when that finally got resolved the sleep tracker started just working part of the time. Rather annoying.,3
465,"Band is awesome at a couple of things, decent at a few things, and does a couple things very poorly. First of all, it's very good at tracking your movement if it's walking/jogging/running/hiking/etc... basically anything on foot makes me feel like I'm getting the best exercise ever (super easy to get activity points just by walking). Secondly, the Tone feedback is very intriguing and quite cool, but definitely drains battery quickly. The app is good and pretty straightforward I think.The band must move around a lot during sleep time because I would say my success rate in actually getting full feedback/sleep tracking is 40%... not great and one of the main reasons I got the band. In addition, the activity tracking is odd. Like I mentioned before, walking is amazing. However, I wear this while I go on long bike rides/do HIIT workouts and I get almost no activity points. For instance I went on a 20 mi bike ride where my Garmin tracker told me I burned about 1,200 cals in the hour ride. I earned 3 acitivity points according to the band so it's just kind of odd that a 2 mile walk will get me 20 points just based on steps and maybe not necessarily heart rate.Overall decent product, price wise definitely better than the WHOOP but it's inconsistency kills me.",3
466,"Let me begin by saying a couple things.1. I've had this for about a month.2. I'm an Amazon employee and have not been able to properly voice concerns due to this. Trust me, I have no favorable bias towards this or will gush about how great it is.I have been forgetting to wear this band, quite honestly.Yes, the sleep tracking feature works well and tracks similarly to my Galaxy Watch 3. It's cool. The body temperature thing is nifty.I tried the body fat thing once (I don't know why people keep thinking you have to be naked for this, but you don't. And for crap's sake, delete the pictures, this feature is optional!) and it was okay. It's not one of the things I use.Tone was kinda cool but it drains the battery quickly, and apparently I sound irritated all the time. COOL! That lasted the first two days.I mainly use the band as an activity tracker because I like the idea of the point system and the motivational system it *intends* to be, not as what it is. I have sent feedback multiple times about how awful and demoralizing it is to lose points per hour after the 8 hour limit since there are people who still work and do not always move around during that time. I sometimes work longer hours, and one day I sat down for dinner and the evening news and lost points. Seriously.In order to work around this, as I am not a fitness-loving person, but someone trying to improve in general, I take the band off in order to have some wiggle room. I put the band back on when I'm about to get up or run errands, but I'm forgetting more and more now. It doesn't matter how much feedback I've submitted or how they sound like they care, but this strict adherence is ridiculous. I've told people interested in hearing about Halo and how it works about this system and it's been quite the turn-off. And now I've forgotten to wear it for two days.Maybe this will reach them now that I can write a public review, since app feedback doesn't seem to do much. 2 stars for a demotivating shame band.",2
467,Like the app and the breakdown of all the categories offered. Battery lasts longer  when not using voice.Did not like: the band. It is beginning to unravel.,4
468,"I currently own a Garmin Fenix 6X Pro and knew going in that the Halo wouldn't come close to replacing that watch and its capabilities (which it costs considerably more than the Halo, so that is to be expected), but I'm always down for a new fitness gadget, so gave it a shot.  Overall, I like the sleep tracking, step tracking / sedentary tracking, and the tone measurement is kind of cool too.I haven't spent too much time with the BMI tool (though I did realize you can leave your underwear / shorts on when doing it), so I'll reserve judgement on that part of the application for the time being.  Also note - I tried an amazon authentic replacement band and the device would not fully charge, so I'm back to the stock band.I'm not sure if I'll be willing to spend the $4 a month once the trial membership expires though as I'm not sure it's worth $48 a year.  The proprietary charger is also a downer as it's one more charger I have to track and the spring closure makes me wonder if charging won't be a problem in the future.  Hopefully the app will continue to improve, and but it might be a hard hard sell, even at the $65 price point, with the ongoing subscription fee, versus picking up a dedicated fitness tracking watch.",3
469,"Mmmm... its ok. Color winter+silver isn't like the picture, looks more like grey with flecks of black. The band is comfortable enough, but after a half day I'm already itching to take it off because the sensor part of the band curves away from my wrist (not flat or curved eith the shape of my wrist) and is a little annoying. Surprised it's only attached with velcro.Functionality wise, it does what it says, though it would be awesome if the tone feature would tell me the phrase it refers to or have a playback feature instead of just a time stamp. I haven't tested out the sleep feature yet.I also have a galaxy watch that I rarely use anymore because of how bulky it feels on my small wrist, but feel like the cool/unique features I get on the halo are still something I would be able to download as apps on my watch if they were available.Overall, a little underwhelmed, but I got at a discount at the pre-release so, so far it's worth it still. Will update once I've had some more time to use its features more fully.",4
470,"I purchased my Halo back in Mid November. I was super excited about it and all that it said it could do. I experienced some issues with the first band I had. It would disconnect. I have to hard reset it at least 4 times and then in Late December after Christmas, I called to express my frustration with not being about to reconnect it and I was able to exchange it. Also, on my first one, the Tone Feature never worked for me.  Now that I have the replacement, I have not experienced any issues with it. I legit love this band! I enjoy not really having to log anything. Every morning I look to see how many sleep disturbances I had.I do take it off to shower just because the band is fabric and I don’t want it to stay wet long. But, eventually, I’ll purchase a silicone band.My only wish for perhaps a future feature or update is that there’s an integration with apps I use to log my food for the day, like My Fitness Pal or Carb Manager.Still I’m very pleased with this purchase.",4
471,What I like:I wanted a fitness tracker that wasn’t flashy had no screen and more casual looking and this is just that. Also I have tiny wrists so I’m able to make it as tight as i need to!The app is super user friendly - I love the live time heart beat and how there’s a ton of free workouts/health and wellness articles/videos etc to improve and help with your personal goals.I like how the BMI shows you what your body could look like if you lose/gainDon’t like:I purchased the winter/sliver and I thought the color would be brighter. I’ll probably purchase a different band since this color just is not what I thought.When you use tone the battery soaks up quickly so it’s inconvenient to have on.Overall I think this gets the job done and majority of the time I forget I even have it on. This tracker hasn’t been linking able to other apps (my work has health and wellness app where you can earn points for steps/sleeping/etc.) so I’m waiting for it to become linkable.Hope this helps someone out!,4
472,"I started using this band back in January of 2021. That was 43 pounds ago. It's not a magic band. You have to do the work, but it is a useful tool in the path to a healthier lifestyle. I like how it tells you your calories burned. I use this to know what my calorie intake should be. It also has useful tips on how to better burn off calories. The faster your heart rate the more calories you burn. Yes, it has your heart rate on there as well. It analyzes body fat percentage, has workout videos and nutritional information. Functions that I don't really use are the sleep and speech monitoring. Maybe I will use them in the future. Overall, I believe this band has helped me tremendously in meeting my goals to be a healthier/fit person. This is something that I have tried and failed to do on my own before I bought this. I would recommend it.",4
473,"I ordered this after reading and watching several good reviews.  I was hoping it would be an alternative to a whoop band, although I wasn’t expecting to be as good.  I liked the fit of it and the actually bad seems to be good quality.But I used it for a workout and it didn’t even last 20 minutes on a run. Kept saying it was disconnected. Had a little over a two hour workout. It tracked 32 minutes of that.I don’t have time to mess with it during a workout. That’s the whole point of it it being a strap with no screen. It should be forgettable.I’m returning and I’ll spend a little more money to get a good product.",2
474,"I love it, price is right.I wish the straps were cheaper to buy and replace, needs more connectivity with other apps",4
475,"This is my first time using a fitness tracker so i don't have anything to compare against.  I like the sleep tracker, a lot.  I only gave 4 stars though because there's no display and the battery has died during the night a couple times leaving me with no sleep tracking.  That's were the frustrations begin.  Lack of display is annoying, i don't love looking at my phone all the time and i never pay attention to the battery of my halo when i'm in the app.Worst of all, the live heart rate monitor and activity tracker do not align.  I've done a weight training workout followed by 20-25 minutes of cardio where i have monitored my heart rate in the app and it states i'm in the ""intense"" range.  Then half hour after i'm done i look at my activity, it says i had been doing moderate activity.  The heart-rate monitor should align with the fitness/activity tracking, it seems that one depends on the other???I do like the accountability that the halo gives me as far as steps and activity on non-workout days, but i'm guessing that any tracker could do this and several of them have a ton more useful features like a display and phone, text capabilities.  I'll likely end up getting a new type of tracker, thinking the garmin vivofit 4.",3
476,"Absolutely love this band. It took me awhile to get use to the way it feels on my wrist. The best placement for it is a little uncomfortable for me but after a week I feel naked without it.It is a total motivater for me! The activity tracker keeps up with my workouts and things I don't consider a workout (gardening, housework, ect) I always felt like I didn't move enough but with this I'm feeling so good and it's pushing me to do more.  I strive to hit my goal points every day/week.The body scan is helpful aswell! When I hit the scale and it hasn't moved it gets me down. But now I do a scan and see where my body fat is at.The mobile app is okay though. I feel like it could be better. The syncing isn't always working right. They don't have a big list of activities to enter either. Would be nice to have custom ones. Would also like if I could link the app with more things.The tone system is also just okay. I could live without it.Sleep tracker is nice. It's another take it or leave it for me though. It's nice to see how good of sleep I got and how often I was disturbed but other then that, meh.Overall, I do really like this as an activity/calorie tracker. The point system pushes me to do better. As a competitive person it does the job I want it to.",5
477,"I’m not normally one to try out brand new technology, I usually wait for the 2nd generation to come out, but I decided to give the Halo a try.The voice feature is neat, but it really drains the battery. I got tired of having to charge my Halo every two days, so I ended up turning the microphone off.I like the body fat feature a lot. I can’t say for sure how accurate it is, because I haven’t tried any other ways of measuring body fat. It gives me a nice baseline to measure my progress with though. I do the scans every week, and it shows me if I’m making any improvements. I also like the little slider that shows you what you would look like at different body fat percentages.The step counting is very accurate, more so than my Fitbit was. It doesn’t count other things as steps, like rocking in a rocking chair (my Fitbit use to think I was walking when I rocked) and it even counts my steps when I push a stroller.I like how the app focuses on your weekly activity rather than having daily step goals.When I have the voice feature turned off, the battery life is pretty good. I also like the little notification I get when my battery reaches 20%.The band is comfortable, and easy to fasten.It says the Halo is waterproof, but I don’t swim, and I usually take it off to shower, so I can’t rate that.The app is a little plain, but then again, it’s getting updates pretty often. I haven’t had any problems with it crashing or freezing.",5
478,"1st the original band that comes with it sucks! It takes a long time to dry after it gets wet and produces an odor, it also gave me rash & flared up my dermatitis bc of that. 2nd I hated the fact that I had to buy a silicone band that doesn't trap water, produce odor and drys quickly especially since the Halo isn't cheap to begin with, it should come with this type of band. 3rd unless you turn on the microphone then you won't get alerts which come as littles flashes of light on the band and subtle vibration. Once I muted my mic I got no alerts unless I checked my phone. The app is really good and offers a lot of full range wellness exercises/activities and tips. However once the app was updated it totally disconnected from my phone and now it won't pair at all so it makes having the halo useless. I wish I could send it back.",4
479,"I've been using this for nearly a week now and I really enjoy it! I love how comfortable it is. I don't even realize it is on my wrist. Some of the reviews I have read are confusing to me. If you do not like the idea of the body scan or the tone feature you do not need to use them or purchase Halo. I did do the body scan and compared it to my smart scale. They were very close. I didn't feel weird about the photo since you can wear similar clothes that you would wear to the gym or out in the summer for a walk. The sleep tracking seems to be pretty accurate. Keep in mind it will only recognize sleep disruption for more than 5 mins in the middle of the night. A trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night is normally less than that. The step tracking seems accurate and I am loving the labs.  Yoga, relaxation before bed, and chair stretches in the middle of the day while I am working are great.  I saw a comment stating Halo not being motivating because you lose points for too much sedentary time. That pushes me even more because you aren't just getting some steps in and feeling like you did your part for the day. I love the points and it makes so much more sense to calculate your overall activity this way. All in all this is a great tracker for me. My previous tracker was a Fitbit Alta HR. If you are looking for a smart watch this isn't it, but it gives you a lot in the way of a tracker for a great price.",5
480,"So before I purchased this I read a lot of reviews.One of them was from a woman who was clearly upset. She was upset for several reasons but one being about the point system ( example if you don't get enough steps in it deducts points on the app) saying how negative it was.First off if you let a small device rule your life that much and are that upset you,you have bigger issues then losing weight.The only con with this in which I already knew before buying it was it doesn't have a face ( no clock face, etc) Of course the reason for that is so you're less distracted. It really didn't bother me at all after about 2 weeks of getting used to it.Everything else was great about it I had no issues. It charged quickly lasted about 4 to 5 days on a charge. I accidentally got it wet several times and I had no issues with it.If you want a device to root you on and keep you moving honestly this is not the device for you. If you want something super simple that still tracks everything and that is still great This is the device for you.I only changed back to Fitbit because I got a new one for a Christmas gift but I still have my Halo.",5
481,"It tracks steps and sleep. That’s pretty much all I needed. I tried tone tracking. I found it pretty useless. It was interesting to see that it thought I sounded certain ways throughout the day but not knowing the context of the conversation it was rating me on leaves with not much valuable info. For example, did I sound rude when I talked to someone? The only thing it gives you is the time that it happened. You’d have to know exactly who you are talking to at what times to be able to go back at end of day and see how you sounded during that convo. It doesn’t always record for every conversation which is fine. I found the live tone feature interesting but more of a novelty. The “3D” model is ok. But I find it lacking. You can only turn your front side to side and back side to side. It doesn’t spin all the way around. It’s just a hair better than a photo in my opinion. Buy it because it’s a cheap option for tracking steps and sleep and doesn’t have a screen so it won’t distract you during your day.",4
482,"I've been wearing my Halo for about six weeks now, and I'm really loving it.The ""sleep tracking"" and ""tone"" features have surprisingly become my favorites. I knew I was a terrible sleeper, but seeing the data definitely helped me make some much needed changes. I'm a remotely working mom of a homeschooled six year old and three year old twins. When I first started wearing the Halo, my tone was in the blue and red... a lot: ""irritated,"" ""annoyed,"" ""resigned,"" ""frustrated,"" ""sad,"" just to name a few. I've become so much more intentional with my kids, cognizant of my tone of voice, doing my best to sound upbeat and fun (even when I'm exhausted), and it's made a world of difference.I thought this would be just another fitness tracker, but it's much more holistic than that. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because there are times that the tracker says I'm sleeping even though I'm awake. The good news is that there is no doubt in my mind that the software will only continue to improve. It'll have five stars in no time.",4
483,"This is a great device if you like to wear regular watches, not smartwatches. You get the benefit of fitness tracking without wearing redundant tools. With no screen it is not meant to be a smartwatch competitor, but instead like Whoop and other screenless devices. It is not distracting and I enjoy checking my gains after heavy movement. I even enjoy the tone feature. There is a ton of content for workouts, meditation and diet. The cons: short battery life, it does not pair well with dress clothes and needs more app integrations. For a device that tracks sleep, you would expect  it to last longer. The lack of a screen does make it a jewelry competitor though. The fabric and silicone straps are too casual for dress or business attire. Could benefit from gold and silver mesh strap options. Would love to see it work with Apple Health, Strava and other health apps.",4
484,"I really want to like this, but I cannot recommend it at this time.I like the minimalist look, yet I find myself constantly opening the app to check heart rate and steps.Speaking of steps/activity, initially I received one point for each minute that I exercised in moderate zone. However, in the last few days, it is not accurately tracking my steps/activity. For a typical 20 minute walk with an average of 110 heart rate I received 3 points. In the past I would receive 15 or more points for the same walk that I take every morning. This is not inspiring.Speaking of the heart rate zones, the app will show that I am in the intense zone but I will only be credited with moderate activity. If I’m in the moderate zone it records it as light. One would think the app would be able to accurately record what it is live reporting.Other issues: inability to enlarge the graphics on a phone or scroll through the charts (e.g., sleep patterns) to see minute by minute changes. Unable to see exact time of heart rate changes, etc. Many of the labs are video-based, which eats up battery life, even though they might better be served as an audio program or just written.I want to like it, I really do. But I’m going back to Fitbit, unfortunately.",3
485,I had issues with my Halo pairing to our new phones We traded in our phones for an iphone 12 max pro.  I have contacted support twice and I am told it will only pair with one phone to unpair it from our old phones which we no longer have.  It worked with our old iphone and note 8 but will not pair.  I finally solved the problem by doing a factory reset by pushing the reset once and then pushing it and holding till there was a purple light. Take it out of the charger. Place it back in the charger for the white flashing light to pair.  Repeating this process numerous times it finally worked.  I was very pleased that I received 2 phone calls this morning from Amazon to help with my problem so I am revising my negative review. The other problem I have had is counting steps.  It helps if you swing your arms while walking for it to count all your steps.,4
486,"This band claims to be a ""no disturbance"" wristband, which basically means there is no sedentary alert or vibration, and also no time display. If you expect any input from the band itself then forgot it. The signature features are Tone (voice recognition), bodyweight comparison, points program. I'll come to them shortly.Personal assessment of the features:1. Appearance. Great. I especially like the velcro design. Very easy to put on and remove.2. Cost. More on the expensive end. $99 + subscription. Other brands from the same level mostly cost less.3. Battery life. No so great especially with Tone turned on. It requires charging every other day.4. Heart rate tracking. Accurate.5. Sleep tracking. It gives a pattern but is not very accurate. It registers a significant amount of disturbance time. Sometimes after a good night's sleep, I felt energized and refreshed in the morning, but according to the app, I was disturbed every a few minutes throughout the night. My body told me otherwise.6. Tone. Sucks. It's supposed to capture your voice and tell you what kind of mode you were in. Doesn't seem to be working. One time I had a meeting for 1.5 hours, the app only registered 15 seconds of emotion in total including 3 seconds of Happy emotion, 5 seconds of Excited emotion and etc.7. Body weight comparison. It requires you to upload pictures of yourself with minimal clothing. I don't know how many people like the idea of having their pictures up in the cloud where god knows who has access to them.8. Points program. This has been covered extensively in other reviews. Many users found it demotivating. I didn't care so that wasn't a problem for me.Final words: a decent attempt at some innovative features, but they're not there yet, and the missing of key features make it a big flop for me. If it came with time display, sedentary/regular alert. or even some of them, in my opinion, would be much more useful than what it is now.",2
487,"I ordered this band after trying to gather as much information as I could and was hopeful that it would be what I though it was.  I was expecting something more along the lines of a fitness tracker, like whoop or Fitbit.  It looks more like this is designed for people that are looking to add a little accountability to their wellness routine.  Amazon has instructions for linking to ""third party apps"" which one would think means Strava or Map My Run or something similar, I was wrong.  The third party apps are pre loaded and the band only seem to support John Hancock Vitality and  Weight Watchers, again wellness accountability.  I can't say much about the functionality for someone looking to get off the couch and increase activity but if you're looking to map running or cycling progress this is not the right band.On the other hand the app interface is pleasing and easy to use, I also love the design of the band.  Ascetically the band is reminiscent the whoop strap and is comfortable as well as discrete.  Based on my experience with Amazon products, Kindle etc, I'm sure that these will be great for anyone looking to track their overall wellness. They will probably get better over time too.  I wish they had more support for training purposes.",3
488,"The design could be thinner and more elegant, but the functionality is great. I just wish the voice tone option didn't drain the battery so much. I don't use it because of that. And, a blood pressure feature would be a nice edition.",4
489,"Does a good job helping me track body fat percentage, sleep, and activity.  I couldn't get the tone feature set up at all; the two times I tried the band factory-reset instead, but since that wasn't the feature I bought this for, it doesn't make a huge difference to me.  A few small things keep it from being five star - it doesn't auto-recognize when I work out like I thought it would. I still have to go in and input the activity and time in the app, and then it links it up with my heart rate data from exercising. I also have to go into the user profile to update my weight each time it changes; the app doesn't have a weight or measurements diary.  I have some skin irritation under the band where the metal contacts for the charger are against my skin. I'll probably have to switch which arm it's on at some point. All and all though, I still like it and will keep using it. Has room for improvement, but is better than some other activity trackers I've tried.",4
490,"I have used both the halo and the halo view. The basic works best for me. I actually had 2 Hal views and lost both due to the tracker not able to securely adhere to band. Never, ever had that problem with the halo. Not an issue for me to check my phone for info",5
491,"So my only really issue is with the app. It will stop working often. I notice that the app shut down more when I am trying to do a movement assessment. However, sometimes it won't sync to the halo band and so you don't always see all your progress. I've had to put in my info multiple times and it is super frustrating.",3
492,"Amazon halo is a great little gadget with some useful data. As everything nowadays it requires a subscription to full utilize the device. Comparing this to other devices, it’s a hit or miss when automatically records a workout. The biggest sell point would be the sleeping tracker, everything else is half baked.",3
493,"First off, one shouldn't complain that this doesn't have a screen. That's apparent before you buy it. I like to think of this as more of a companion product. With that being said, It doesn't do everything but it does some things other trackers do not.It's compact and actually comfortable to sleep in unlike other watches. This makes me more likely to keep it on all night for tracking sleep quality.The body composition functionality while pretty cool, really requires decent back lighting. It can be tricky as you find yourself basically doing the hokey pokey to try and get in the proper position. It's a bit of a pain but cool when you hit the target.The voice stress levels are also cool but it does decrease battery life. Along the lines of battery life and charging, it can take some shifting to get the contacts to connect when you're ready to charge.Overall, I think this is a good first attempt for Amazon. It's a good ""lite"" tracker. With a few tweaks, it could definitely be made better.",4
494,"I have had this since October so I've had plenty of time to evaluate this device.I have found the voice monitor not only HUGELY inaccurate & useless but it also drains the device battery within 12 hours, therefore I shut down that option and do not use it at all.Compared to a Fit Bit, I would choose the Fit Bit.This device has a lot of issues and I do not see the benefit of it nor why a monthly subscription fee should be charged to Prime members?I will not be renewing my subscription and am considering returning this device for a full refund.I do not find the labs to be easily assessable, they are confusing and are too numerous to be effective. I do not find any of the labs useful as a matter of fact. Listening/watching  labs through my phone is not something I want to do. Especially with sleep labs and workout labsI do not like the activity monitor as I do not see it to be accurateThe sleep monitor is vague... I do not know its accuracy because its impossible to monitor my sleep, as I am sleeping.I find it time-consuming and an inconvenience to have to bring up the app on a phone to have access to information I have had instances where it has deleted all my stored info with no explanation from tech supportI have had times when it did not record my sleep...c/s is pretty much uselessBottom line, IMO, this is an overpriced device, that requires a subscription and has alot of issues to be worked out.I do not know if the issues lie in the software/firmware, with the device or both.UPDATE: 02/22/2021I hate this device. I want a refund. Got it in October and it no longer functions at all as described.I had reported issues from the start.Does not sync.Full charge no sync.No low battery alerts tho alerts are enabled.Goes off line without my knowledge, despite doing ALL RECOMMENDED TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURES!Lost or not recorded data (so useless in that respect)Customer service is a joke and does nothing but keep telling me the same trouble shooting steps over and over and over.I have informed them those steps do nothing to resolve a LEMON deviceI am ashamed to own this Amazon productWaste of my money and timeJuly 2012: even though this device fell apart (back fell off) when reviewing my credit card statement Amazon was charging me for subscription that I did not agree to!Had to notify my credit card of unauthorized charges AND had to contact c/s to complain and get the fees off my credit card!So, check your cc statement if this is not something you subscribed to!!!",1
495,"I have been using the Halo band for about 2 months. I'm quite impressed with the band and the app. Much better than I was expecting for a new Amazon device.For the most part, the sleep tracking seems pretty accurate.I've tried the Tone analysis on the app. While I like the concept, I feel that it might be a little inaccurate.  It also depletes the battery very quickly. You will need to charge your band everyday. With the Tone disabled the battery lasts about 5-6days for me.The app has a lot of ""labs"" or challenges as well as stand alone exercise programs that you can do. I like that there are also labs and programs that don't just pertain to exercise, but mindfulness and nutrition as well.I gave it 4stars because I do see room for improvement of the app. There are times when the programs are not available or the app is not updating. But, for a new product, growing pains are expected. I would definitely recommend this as an alternative to some of the much pricier brands out there.",4
496,"I'm very happy with this product, but would like to see the same item with a pulse ox monitor as well.",4
497,"I was beyond excited to try this device and I really really wanted to like it.  I currently use a Samsung smart watch but I wanted one more detailed.  My thoughts.1.  I wasn't terribly concerned with the no display but it's odd wearing both this device and a watch.2. I saw a review complaining that it was demotivating.  The 150 points per week is MINIMAL.  I was sick and stayed on my couch for 3.5 days and still went above and beyond the 150 points per week, with only 1 workout session on a rowing machine.  You really have to be sedentary to not get 150 points per week.3. That said - I find this tracker grossly overstates the number of steps I get per day and the calories I've burned.  I notice I get over 10,000 steps way more easily than my samsung watch ever showed.  It regularly shows I burn over 2400 calories a day.  My samsung watch used to show something closer to 1800 calories a day.  I know neither device will be totally accurate, but I'd prefer my device to err on the side of underestimating versus overestimating.4.  I LOVE the sleep tracker.  It gives way more in-depth analysis than my Samsung watch does.  I have decided to return the tracker but I will miss this function.5. The tone measurements - meh.  I didn't set mine to picking up my tone constantly and I found it to be quite random.6. Body fat measurements - it was super cool, but it was vastly different from in-body scans I've done.  If you have more muscle mass than the average person, it probably won't be super accurate.7. Charging - charging was annoying until I realized I could pop the sensor out of the band and put just the sensor on the charger by itself.  I did find it stayed charged longer than my samsung device.Overall, it has promise.  If they devlop a display screen on the device and more accurately track activities, I will try again later!",2
498,"There’s much to love about the Halo band: it’s supremely comfortable (I’ve never bought a fitness tracker because they’re uncomfortable, but I forget I’m wearing this because it’s so light and streamlined), it gives me an wealth of useful information and motivation, and it’s great value for the money. That said, the membership and its exercise programs were a big reason I bought the Halo band, but it has almost nothing suitable for seniors. It doesn’t even have a Seniors filter tag. The workout programs are fast-paced and feature all young, fit people - a recipe for injury for those of us who can’t safely move so fast or who have the lesser mobility that comes with age. This would be easy to fix, too, since there are plenty of brands aimed at seniors or with senior modules that Amazon could include in the app workouts (Silver Sneakers and the Joe Wicks senior workouts come to mind). Amazon, please give us seniors some workouts!",4
499,"Updated: The most recent app update seems to have mostly fixed the Bluetooth and updating problems so I am upgrading my rating to 4 stars. I am leaving the previous review below as it still contains relevant information.Positives: The sleep tracking feature was interesting and seemed to do a good jobNegative: The Bluetooth connection was indescribably awful. I've bought cheap Chinese junk devices with better Bluetooth connections than this, I don't know why Amazon skimped out on core architecture of their device like this but they managed to completely ruin the user experience by making it buggy and unreliable. If the band can't connect to your phone it is useless.Other negatives, the pulse measurement seemed inconsistent, though that maybe the result of where you wear the band it's still not ready for prime time.Other, other negatives, the photo section for the app. No one wants this. I don't know who you talked to that told you that people would like their phones to take pictures of them and upload mostly naked pictures of themselves to be evaluated but they are very, very stupid.",4
500,"After using this band for a couple of months ,the first thing I can say if you want a great sleep tracker this is it.It is fairly comfortable,I had to take it off once a week to sleep just for a break.The weight loss scanner is really good and worth the price of the band with 6 months of the app.Gives you get feedback on a weight loss campaign.The exercise tracking is very good and passive,which is my favorite thing.You don’t have to start or tell it what you are doing.The voice recognition and analysis is my big disappointment,it just recognizes other voices than mine and you can’t remove a time when it picked up a mistake in conversation.Also really drains the battery quickly.As far as the apps and labs ,the app functions fine but I found the labs to be a gimmick,Didn’t really use them outside of the exercise ones.Overall for the price and functionality,it works very well and not so expensive that if they stop improving it or a better one comes out you regret buying it.",4
501,"Short and sweet review.Pros:- No Display. I'm not a fan of distractions on my wrist. I have a watch. It's a good old fashion mechanical watch and does its job very well. I don't need anything else.- Sleep tracking. I'm putting this in the pros because I found value to it. Is it accurate? Kinda. The more granular information like times you wake up at night are questionable. It sometimes thinks I'm still asleep when I'm sitting down at my desk to start my work day (I work from home).- A usable app. I've seen some reviews where people don't like the app. I don't discount those opinions. Personally, I found value in the app on my Android phone. It provided the information I was looking for and I didn't have to go searching for it.Cons:- The charger sucks, period. You can fiddle with it all you want, it's hit or miss whether it'll actually charge on your first try.- The actual device is uncomfortable. This is a personal opinion so you may have a different experience. However, the sensor section made my skin break out. Also, I had to cinch the band to get it to stay in place on my wrist which made the band uncomfortable as well. And the device felt bulky on my wrist.- What do you mean there's a subscription? Yeah, that was a surprise. Sure the Halo isn't as expensive as an Apple Watch, but at a list price of $100, it ain't cheap either.I wanted to like it. But, the charger was a non-starter. Then after my skin started breaking out where the sensor sat on my wrist, it was time to put it away. I tried to tough it out. So much so that I went beyond the return window. My Halo found its way into the junk drawer a couple of months ago.Coincidentally, I pulled it out this afternoon to charge it. I have a friend that's interested in trying it so I figured I'd get it charged up and maybe a software update. I had to re-create my account in order to do so. So, there's another con.",2
502,"I have an Apple Watch Series 7 and it is wonderful, save for battery life that requires me to charge it during the night.  I decided to give Amazon a try since the battery life (without Tone) lasts so long with the main purpose of wearing it at night to get an idea as to sleep scores. All of the other capabilities were gravy for me.However...The device is constantly telling me that it cannot measure my sleep because it is too loose on my wrist.  To respond, I would tighten it so that I could get a sleep score.  I tightened it to the point where a red mark was left on my wrist in the afternoon AFTER taking it off in this morning without a sleep score (see enclosed picture).  For several weeks, I have tried to consistently to get a sleep score - and I was successful, about 20% of the time.I did not use Tone or scan my body fat for the device.  I wanted to see if sleep monitoring was a core competency of the device.  Based on my results, it is not.I'm disappointed in Amazon.  My home has their Alexa products (of all shapes and sizes) in every room of my house and I couldn't be happier.  The music and food services that come with those devices is amazing. Amazon had me believing in their ability to deliver across product lines due to my satisfaction with those other devices.Unfortunately, the Halo band is just not good enough to consistently perform above bar - or even up to basic expectations.  If they truly are customer-obsessed, they will address these shortcomings and send me a new one when they do.Until then, the Halo will occupy a special place in my nightstand table.",1
503,"I had the halo for about a month before I lost the device it self.  One day i was at work for about 12 hours went home and went to check my Halo.  The device was gone, I was heart broken I really liked it but I still had the strap to my wrist.I got to thinking about what could have been done better. I believe I have came up with something. All was needed was to keep the device on the wrist. So I came up with this Idea.  If only there was a chargeable battery that could be ""snapped on"" to the device at night while sleeping to recharge it. The device would never have to come off your wrist so a permeant strap could be used. I also have anther Idea. a strap that incorporated both a apple watch and this device. While the apple watch charges another charger (wireless charger) would charge the Halo. there for it would never leave the strap and could be made permeant to the strap.I hope these Ideas help in someway",4
504,"Easy to Use App, Comfortable on the Wrist & Worth Every Penny!The Halo has helped guide me to better sleep, overall reducing my stress levels and has made me more conscious of my choices from what I eat and drink to when I do certain activities. The Halo band is comfortable, I wear it next to my Apple Watch on my left wrist, but my only complaint is that with both being next to one another they rub which is becoming more and more noticeable. The Halo's intuitive app allows me to more easily track my sleep and to analyze my habits all from my iPhone. In the past few months, the Halo has given me healthier sleeping patterns and has gamified sleep, driving me to want a higher score each night.I was originally in the market for a tracker like this, comparing and contrasting features against cost. The Halo band came out to market and I couldn't be happier with this product or the experience. I have and will continue to recommend the Halo band to anyone that asked.",4
505,"I love this halo it the next best thing I would use all the time but there are some pros and con. Pro’s : it’s very accurate at tracking the sleep tracker. But just to point out I love the way the app tracks everything u need. sleep, weight, food, exercise, water and more. Con’s the band is hard to keep clean even though you can wash it in the washing machine. And it has no time so you would have to take your phone with you just to till time but if you are some like me who likes to digital detox while exercising then this it the best watch for you and then the worst problem of all that makes it a real con the battery life last only for one to two days unlike the fitbit or apple you will have to charge this baby a lot. So if your use to charging your watch every night and not tracking your sleep then by all means get it but just know you will have to put in a little work with this watch.",4
506,"Halo wins! I retired Whoop and have been using Halo for almost a year at the time of this review.I've never worn a watch before and I hardly ever take this device off. The trick is to wear it on the inside of your wrists on your none dominate hand.Here's what I don't like, charger is odd, and battery could be better. I get about 2 days use. That's with all features, if I turn off tone you can add 1.5 days. Also, you have to take it off to charge it.The analytics are setup for advanced meatheads to novice users. If you go to the gym often the point system and activity are just as good as Whoop. Whoop is more technical, but very similar when you look past all whoop's charts.Whoop is super bulky and I didn't like wearing it. The main factor to ditch it, is the expense to run it every month. And I can't export my data.If you're a novice, their is huge library of exercises, workouts, and yoga. Also, sleep programs and other programs to make your day.Enjoy!PS I really liked the review about the person who hates Halo. Mainly, because he got 9 points for sitting in a chair on zoom for 9 hours. Then got 2 points taken away for letting the dog out?!!I think you get 50 points just for breathing.",5
507,"I was in the market for a fitness tracker.  I dislike like connecting to tech while exercising, so this seemed like the perfect fit.  Easy set up. Comfortable band (hint:  If you find it uncomfortable, turn it over so that the tracking part is on the bottom of your wrist) and I love that it doesn't have a screen. I do a lot of hiking and the idea that it would do all the tracking for me while I remained tech-free was a great fit for my lifestyle.The first few times I used it, it did not track my hike.  I assumed it was user error and kept trying.  I eventually got the hang of it, but would need to restart it several times to get it to connect - not convenient but not the end of the world.  Another issue is that it would record an evening family movie as ""sleeping"" boosting my sleep score to something that was not even close to what my sleep schedule looks like (my husband snores terribly).  I work in a tech environment (why I like to unplug when away from work) and it would also record my work time as more mid-day sleep. Not helpful at all.  I wish my Halo sleep score was a true reflection of my life.  hahaFurther, I fully have the hang of connecting the halo to my phone before starting my workout or hike after months of using it. Yet just yesterday, I hiked a four mile moderate hike and when I was done - NOTHING.  It recorded nothing.  Battery was at 67% and I had zero points recorded for the WEEK for activity.  Meaning it didn't even pick up anything from when I was home prepping for the hike, doing laundry, cooking, getting mail, making beds, etc.  I decided to give it one last chance to wait until I got home and my phone could connect to WIFI and see if it would update my data - but still nothing.I really wanted to love the Halo.  Still do.",2
508,"Whew- Don't want to make this emotional so will only list Pros Vs. Cons.Pros:-App is well made/ the fitness & meditation programs are easy to use and very very helpful. Can be set for reminders. Learned my cat likes bedtime stories.- Does what all new fitness trackers do for a better price except stress/anxiety monitoring-I walk about 20,000-30,000 steps a day at work. It keeps accurate count.-Tracks tone of voiceCons:- does not track naps. Only does one period of sleep and thats it. I wake up early and work long hours. Naps are how I survive. Have to wear it tight to even get a reading for sleep-Bruised my skin. I took a few days off and took my halo off to charge & a bruised had formed / started peeling where my halo had been.- I mentioned walking 20,000+ steps a day right ? Well one day I got off early and ended up napping several times throughout the day. I lost some of my accumulated points for lack of activity.The app is enjoyable truly and I mainly got it for the tone tracking but it doesn't offer any tips on changing tone so its kinda worthless in that regard. Im gonna go ahead and grab a Garmin. Been eyeing the music playing one for awhile.",3
509,"I was really excited for my halo band and I do like it for just one feature. I like the body scan and body fat analysis. Actually, that might be the only thing I really like about it. The sleep measuring is OK, nothing life-changing.What I would caution people who use this device is that it listens to the tone of your voice and will give you a score or a bar chart to let you know how happy you sound, how indifferent you sound, how miserable you sound, etc. This is the worst thing ever. If you want a judgmental band to tell you how terrible you sound most of the time and that you’re miserable or irritated or neutral, then go ahead and get this band. I’m trying to have some positivity in my life and so I have turned off the voice function and I use his band only for the body fat analysis. According to this band....based on my tone of voice I am a miserable, grumpy, indifferent, irritated person, neutral person. Haha. Rude.",4
510,"This is not at all what I expected from an Amazon product. I did read the other reviews but I wanted to see for myself. After just 3 days of use, it is going back.The first major issue is the BMI tracker. For men, this may not be an issue but for a female, it could be a major mental problem. The app actually asks you to wear as little clothing as possible and then set your phone up so the camera can scan your body. It saves the image and then it will ask you to do this again at different times so you can see your progress. My issues are security of course but also mental problems. In the hands of a depressed person or a person with body issues, this can be disastrous. Losing weight, yes it's great but what if the images show you gaining weight and showing where you gained it? To me i see an eating disorder maker that you wear on your wrist.That aside, the thing is very uncomfortable to wear. No matter how many times I adjust it, I hate the feeling. I have worn some type of tracker for about 5 years and never had issues like this.The battery is just about dead after 72 hours as well.The sleep tracking is a complete joke. It says it takes me about 8 minutes to fall asleep. I wish that was the case. If I fall asleep in 45 minutes I'm lucky. The amount of time it says i was in bed is 8 hours but I went to bed at 11pm and got up at 5:15am so how is that even possible???The step tracking is ok but how does it decide the intensity of the activity? I have levels that say low when it should be high.All in all, it needs a lot of work. I was hoping I would love it because I love all of my other Amazon products but I just could not bring myself to find a reason to not return it.",2
511,One of the screens in the mobile app will track you voice and give you an immediate response on your mood while talking.Think what that does when you are responding to a client or having an important conversation.That's just a small part of wearing a HALO. Real-time response to your physical being is priceless. Read up on it so you know the privacy concerns. Keep it charged and be sure to check it when you get up in the morning.,4
512,"This product’s main competitor is the Whoop, which I had for six months. Overall, I do like the Halo band more.Pros:-smaller than the Whoop-App doesn’t provide “recovery” data (I.e. how well you slept in relation to the strain you performed the previous day). This was a mental battle for me with the Whoop-can still be usable for the data without the subscription; the Whoop is useless without the subscription-Lab library is immense and definitely useful-cheaper-I love the live HR featureCons:-doesn’t track my naps well. It’s been counting them as sedentary time because of how long it takes me to fall asleep-Tone feature sucks the battery life, but you don’t have to use it.I’m an incredibly active person (Olympic weightlifting is my sport with Orange Theory on the side) despite working from home, so it’s been very motivating to see how intense my training sessions are with data as opposed to just how I feel.I haven’t taken advantage of the body fat % feature so I can’t speak on that.",4
513,"I like the sleep score and meditation . But the sleep tracking score and others results took hour, too long to show up,  Sometimes all day. I don’t like it.  I wish it shows up faster.",3
514,"I was thrilled to start using the Halo Band, yet the first glimpse of the app was unconvincing. Using it was absolutely raging.You can’t track your calories! And what’s more the app doesn’t even connect to basic calorie tracking apps such as MyFitnessPal!The app doesn’t connect to Health app of the iPhone. Incredible amateurism!It shows you only steps you walked, not the distance…It’s hard to believe that such smart tracker is paired with such incomplete & useless app. What a disappointment!",3
515,"I am 62 (female) and very active. Have been for years. I have a love/hate relationship with technology and have not cared to get a Fitbit or Apple Watch as I don’t need yet another screen vying for my attention. I know with my eating and activity I’m in a good track, however, my sleep is all over the map. I saw the Halo Band and loved the fact that it doesn’t have a display! I bought it for sleep tracking, but quickly got excited about all the other features. Just finished my first week and still learning, but It’s fun! I am a fan!",4
516,"I was looking for something that would provide me more feedback and data on my sleep and activity and that wouldn't require a lot of charging. I don't use the voice analysis features, so I easily go over a week without charging the Halo. While its step counter might not be as sophisticated as more expensive smart watches, its tie to your activity level allows me to better track when I ride a stationary bike or do a rowing machine as compared to my Samsung smart watch. My watch I have to charge every day by the end of the day, so I rarely use it to track my sleep, which was also an insight that I was interested in, but the extended battery life of the Halo as allowed me to get a better picture of my sleep. Overall this has been a great item for my needs, but I recognize that if you are looking for the features of a full smart watch this may not reach that level, but if you are looking for an activity and sleep tracker with long battery life that you can forget about until you want to review your data, this is an awesome device for that. I'm looking into trying more of the features and advice offered by the app, admittedly for my desired usage I'm probably just scratching the surface of what is available there.",5
517,overall it think its amazing compared to fit bits and others around this price range for fitness trackers (I mean yea the company with one of the worlds most advanced camera systems so more or less expected). its really durable I end up banging mine on a lot or things for my job and its really got no scratches. The battery is just amazing if you don't have the tone tracking on mine has lasted 2 weeks with no charging .Body scan is really nice I do however wish you could by a scale to pair with this so you could get better and more accurate data. My only con is that I got to a gym and for using equipment it cant really track your fitness idk if its because the band doesn't really move or not. But either way if it running or tracking any sort of steps this is pretty amazing ( also the system where it shows your fitness point for the week that your body type should be doing i really like just makes it a little more fun for me).,4
518,"I was really interested in the Amazon Halo when it first got announced, and I am really glad I got it. On its own, it’s just a band on your wrist, but when paired with the app, it’s wonderful. It tracks your activity fairly accurately, figures out how you slept based on the amount of time you’ve spent in each stage, and even tracks your overall weight and healthiness with the body scan feature. I will say that the body scan part kind of needs you to have someone to hold the phone, or a really stable low surface to rest the phone on. The 3D model it produces is scarily accurate, however, the one that shows what you might look like at different weights is pretty inaccurate. My favorite feature is the sleep tracker, and it helps me figure out if why I feel bad has to do with sleeping poorly or not. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who is trying to lose or maintain their weight.",5
519,"""Amazon Halo"" is one of the best products that I have purchased that allows me to learn more about myself and my personal fitness! I've learned about my heart rate at work during activity, what type of quality sleep I have achieved from the sleep tracking, the quality of my voice tone recognition demonstrating a positive morale, & that I am not eating enough to cover my calorie usage. I burn so many calories per day and need whey protein to just keep up! Who knew! When eating more during high burn rates, I have been loosing more weight! During the day during break, I check my heart rate ""live"" to ensure it's not spiking too high for the activity we are performing at work! At home, I read all the details from the mobile app. I haven't taken it off! I love it & know that it is a resource tool to keeping my life on track for the highest quality fitness available on the planet! Will be taking my stats from the mobile app with me to my Dr. for added insights of my performance. This type of additional input will boost my knowledge and know how to the Ultimate Next Level for Health! Speaking of Next, I will be purchasing a second band to wear. Just waiting on the B1G1 free promo! Amazon Halo is Fun, Fit, & Fashion Right! Young or Old, U deserve to know more about U!",5
520,It is a bit bulky and can hurt if the band is a bit snug. Would love to have had the option of what band to get with it instead of being sent the fabric one that came with it. But I have enjoyed wearing it. The app keeps getting better. Hopefully they are listening to what people are saying. The tone option is unique and handy. I work with lots of people and teens and it helps when giving lessons are talking with them to see how I may be coming across. I do like the no screen so that I'm not looking at it all the time like my friends are with their stuff. They are always concerned about steps and what it's registering. The programs they offer in the app are interesting. Would love to save interesting ones for later use after finishing the ones I'm doing. All in all it's been handy to have. The price is decent. Battery life not bad if you remember to turn off the mic when you're not interested in finding out about your tone.,4
521,The body fat tracking is wayyyyyy off and one of their main claims was it was superior to smart scales. I’m around 8% and it says I’m at 14%— nearly 100% offI really do like the app and user interface though.,3
522,"I may have had excessively high expectations for this product given all it does is track sleep, motion, heart rate, and tone of voice. I expected that it would do those things very well, above and beyond other trackers (or even the Apple Watch). I was very excited for the launch.Unfortunately, I found the device to be very inconsistent and inaccurate in tracking my activity and heart rate in particular.  In doing side by side comparisons with my Apple Watch, they were similar when just sitting and inactive, but wildly different when I was exercising or running. During intense HIIT workouts, my Apple Watch would say 160 bps and the Halo would say 96 bps. I literally completed 60 seconds of burpees and the Halo device said my heart rate was 82 bps vs. 171 bps on my Apple Watch. It is too sensitive to big arm movements (swinging my arms around was the only way I could get it to register I was doing a relatively intense workout). It was also inconsistent. I would do the exact same run (same route, same distance, same pace +/- 5 seconds/mile) and it would give me activity scores ranging from 24 points to 12 points. Similarly, I would go on a walk (shorter than my runs), and it would give me anywhere between 2 points to 14 points. It is extremely demotivating to get 12 points for a moderately intense run and get 14 points for a shorter, much easier walk the next day. So demotivating that I stopped using the device.It also is not particularly comfortable, and it felt like I had to wear it too tightly to accurately track my sleep. I also expected it to be very comfortable given the expectation of wearing it basically 24 hours a day. It was not. It left a mark on my wrist and bothered me while I was sleeping.On the plus side, the tone tracking was novel, and I thought it was interesting to try to think through what I was doing when my tone was dismissive. I also thought the app was helpful.",2
523,"Pros:* The actual band didn't cause my wrist to break out like other bands* Tone- basically it listens to your choice of words and calculates your choice of negative or positive words. Helpfull if you're trying to be more mindful of word choices* size- it's a decent size for smaller wristsCons:* Charger- The charger is the worst. I had to get a second halo because the first one would not charge. The second one has to be delicately placed on the charger and wiggled until it starts to charge.* Accuracy- I used my phone, halo, unconnected fitbit (meaning, it was a fitbit assigned to a different device so my phone and fitbit do not merge data), and a basic pedometer to compare the steps and see which device came the closest to the basic pedometer. The Halo was inaccurate 100% of the time. Unless there is conspiracy among my phone, fitbit, and pedometer.Tone- The tone works well... as long as you have inflection in your voice and your word usage matters. Does not work if you are monotone. It mostly just listens to everything you say and base your tone on your word usage.Battery life- if you actually are able to charge it... leave off tone unless you want to charge it two times a day* Time- there is no clock. Who designed this thing?! It's alright to not have all the fancy stuff, but no clock... come on now. I was hoping to be able to use this like I would a fitbit. But nope. I still have to carry my phone or wear an extra watch to know the time. Pretty lame. It's like fitbit knock off status... but without a clock that even the knockoffs have.I used fitbit as an example because smart watches are completely different beasts. I was super excited for this item, but got super disappointed. Makes me not watch to try the Amazon glasses",2
524,"One of the critical reviewers on here claimed they ""ran 3 miles and only got 9 points"".  They must have a defective Halo band.  As explained on the app, even a fast walk counts as ""moderate activity"", which earns 1 point per minute.  Assuming they are an average runner, 3 miles would take about 30 minutes.  That's 30 points.  If they actually RAN, that would be considered ""intense activity"", and they would get TWO points per minute. I run only about 1.5 miles on a treadmill daily ( a mix of ""intense"" and ""moderate"") and I usually reach my 150 points in about 5 days.I use the Halo now instead of my Fitbit because to the Fitbit, a step is just a step no matter how much effort was expended.  The Halo point system is much more realistic and useful.BTW, the Halo is just a measuring tool. It  just gives you statistics.  If you feel ""shamed"", that's on you.",4
525,"The battery life is amazing & I like the lightness of the unit. It takes a while getting used to having no face/screen like a regular watch. My stats were cool to keep track of because they kept me aware of my body & changes. I loved the 3D body composition reports. Nothing like seeing yourself in 3D😂🤣.Unfortunately, in a little over a year my Halo has completely died. I had to completely hard reset it a few months back and YES all my data was gone. I was willing to start over. Now it won't sync at all with any device.  Soooooo.... Thanks for all the fun my dearest Halo, but won't get it another one right now or anytime soon. A year is just not long enough, so yep... rest in peace.",4
526,"I bought out of curiosity, and received in late Nov 2020.I thought that Amazon might create an innovative sleep tracker that would be different from others. I was wrong.1. I don’t use the tone measure feature-never turned it on due to battery drain. I wanted something relatively set-and-forget for several days.2. I wore the halo 24/7 other than when showering or charging.3. Battery life was pretty good - 4’ish days when not using tone measurement.4. I soon forgot it was on me-didn’t matter when sleeping.5. The app fails primarily in that it doesn’t connect with any other services that people generally use like Apple Health. Only WW and John Hancock insurance (?). So a walled garden, which feels so 1999.6. The biggest fail in my experience is that the Halo didn’t capture awake time accurately at all. Many nights when I knew I was awake for 1-3 hrs, it registered that time as light sleep. This is due to an inherent flaw in how the Halo measures sleep which is movement-oriented. Good sleep it tended to capture well, ie, on nights that I knew were active REM/no defined awake periods it seemed to track well.All in all, I would not recommend based on poor sleep tracking and limited app data sharing.",3
527,"had it maybe a year and a half or so, worked well during that period but today when I opened the app it made me go through the entire process of setting it up again and it wouldnt connect to my phone... Over a year of data just lost and now its useless. When it worked I like tracking my sleep and mobility. Will prob not buy this again.",3
528,"This band works great for tracking your steps and tracking your tone. Other than that....it is lacking. The body fat scan is erroneous. I have tried scanning back to back, and each time I get a different reading (with a pretty reasonable error each time). This makes it hard to track progress. The sleep tracking feature is okay. It does not track naps - so don't purchase this if that is your goal.Furthermore, the time spent in bed/time to fall asleep is also inaccurate (from my experience.) Tone tracking works and is an excellent feature, as long as you are not creeped out by amazon storing little audio clips of you talking...just like with the Alexa. Also, the 3.99/month fee for the halo services is NOT worth it. If you are considering buying this band, I would maybe wait until the newer version is out. Or think of a Garmin for a bit more of an investment.The perks: The band is comfortable, and I love that there is no screen to distract me. You can get it wet, and it works reasonably well for tracking your swim workouts.",3
529,It has to be charged m ore than it says it does,4
530,"I was an early adopter of this product.  I had high hopes.  I gave it the length of the pandemic lockdown.  I'm done with it.To be honest, I never tried the BMI or voice analysis features.  That's not why I bought it.  This review isn't about that.The activity tracker worked for me as advertised.The app?  I couldn't install it on my Apple device to save my life, not even spending 4 hours on the phone with Amazon's support team.  I ended up having to put it on my Galaxy S7 so the app was slow because I wasn't buying a new phone for one app.Even then, I still was determined to give this thing a try.... because I bought it for sleep monitoring, which deeply disappointed me.The app's ""programs"" didn't help me one bit.  I tried them all, following suggestions, performing their ""meditations"" (which ended up annoying me more than relaxing me), etc.  I finally got sick of them and just stopped.  I used it purely as a monitoring device.I got really tired of the app telling me I got a good nights sleep when I had less than 6 hours of overall sleep in an evening but I still used it because I still used the monitoring of my REM/Light/Deep sleep.So, since I wasn't using all the special programs, etc., I stopped the monthly membership.  Stopping the monthly membership then took away the REM/Light/Deep sleep monitoring and I didn't realize that was included in it.Endgame.  I took it off this morning and I'm done with the device.If you are considering this as a sleep monitoring device, I'd highly recommend looking elsewhere, despite the attractive price of $69.99 when it's on sale.",2
531,"I love everything about this body monitor! I'll be honest I got it because 1 it's new at a discount and 2 I have a teenager with a attitude just as bad mine. Yeah my mom said she hoped I'd have a kid just like me and good God I was blessed with a mini me... I love that the Halo monitors my tone of voice. When I ordered it I was thinking ""just wait I'll show that lil turd that I am happy and joyous it's just him that gets me worked up!"". Yeah, Halo proved that I've been lying to myself, surprise surprise, and I'm not quite the joyous, lively and happy person I thought I was. I honestly can't deny the truth either. I've done several of the labs to help with my interval fasting and making sure to drink enough water. The labs are very helpful and I've already learned new habits that make me feel a lot more positive about the direction my health is going. This is the only tracker or monitor that I've ever been able to wear while sleeping. I do have a Samsung watch but it's very large and clunky while I hardly ever notice that I have the Halo on. I typically get close to 2 days out of charge since I use the tone feature all day everyday to prove that lovely child of mine wrong.I love the Halo so much that I'm actually writing this review as I'm buying my angry teenage bundle of joy a Halo so we can use the tone and fitness features together! We're both pumped for Russell Wilson's Danger Train!",5
532,"I bought this product for sleeping in mind, I have issues with insomnia & was hoping to figure out what’s causing the issues. I was hoping to connect to Apple Health Kit - nope not an option! Very disappointing - I have multiple devices connected for an overall picture of health. It did track my HR while sleeping which was one of the reasons I bought it, I usually run bradycardiac (low HR) it does track this well! The charger works half of the time, it would be a great product if I didn’t already have experience with Apple Watches! Def has some issues and the subscription is a bit ridiculous!",3
533,"Some features you may find creepy, but you can shut them off and it IMPROVES battery life. I will admit this is my second one. I had bought the silver before, and it gets rather dirty looking after awhile. I do shadow boxing with this and it does an excellent job of heart rate tracking. Also you want to keep the band AS LOOSE as possible. I had it really tight on my last one and was getting all kinds of marks on my arms that took time to heal. I let Amazon know, and I realized it was my fault. They still took my unit back and gave me a refund. They also gave me a $50 credit to get a new one because they promised a replacement, and the person was not athurized to do so. So this is supported by excellent customer service too. I got it again because I was impressed by the device, that I could pay it off in payments. The app library is still growing and has a veriety of activities and videos. Edit: Changed 5 star review to 3 stars. Please remember the charger is a bunch of junk. I spend maybe 4 or 5 minutes fiddling with it, (Lining up the contacts is HARD) just to get it to charge these days.",3
534,"This product absolutely ""wowed"" me. I have not seen a better fitness tracker on the market, and I do not think that I ever will.First of all, getting this product started up was plug and play. It took about 5 minutes and I was off to the races tracking my fitness.Voice recognition has been extremely insightful for me. It makes my day to see that the moments I come across as happy / laughing / positive are more plentiful than those that are more associated with negative emotions.The body fat functionality is very impressive. I mean, this is some scientific stuff. The device through your height, weight, and a picture can make a reasonable and believable assessment of body fat and compare to benchmarking. I have since used this feature to understand the fact that as a slightly overweight male, I needed to workout, which resulted in my follow up purchases of a peloton bike, a home gym weight setup, and a closet full of running equipment. I have already reduced my body fat percentage by 0.2% in the month that I have had this device!The sleep tracking is extremely useful. Most importantly, I can now factually prove that my significant other is waking me up in the middle of the night when she gets up to pee. Unfortunately, on the flip side she can prove the same thing about me.For the price, this device is cutting edge and amazing. I recommend to all people interested in their overall wellness. I can't wait to see what is in store next for the Halo product line!",5
535,The band is soft and the tracker is light weight enough that I hardly notice it’s there.,4
536,"The halo was exactly what I needed to get motivated.  I was nervous to order because of reviews that said it is reactive in the data it provides.  Others said no other functions such as a watch face.  I own many watches but choose not to wear them.  This Jalo band is super comfortable, gives the information that I did not know I would want.  I log in to the app in the morning, check sleep, I log in the evening to see activity level which has motivated me to beat the previous day or week!  I don’t want or need to be looking at my wrist during a work out?!? I am not at a level to do that.  I just want to finish the run or work out.  This item in my opinion is a perfect tool to keep a beginner working to beat my own stats.  I feel the body fat tracker is good but I do mot have a way to track accuracy.  The sleep tracker has proven to be accurate in disturbances, sleep temperature, again is is retro active but I have determined certain activities or days I do not sleep as well due various reason.  This halo band is helping me change some habits and become more active.",5
537,"This is a neat device that is hobbled by its lack of support for any website that you might view on a larger screen.  It also, and curiously, does support any of Amazon's Fire Devices.  I'm older, I like looking at information on a larger screen.  On the phone app, which is your only option, the basic results screens are clear enough, but the 40-50 suggested apps and tricks just get crowded out at the bottom of the phone display.  The other thing that seems like an obvious oversite -- why not a website where I could see my progress over time, easily?  The exercise counter resets to zero each week.  There is no way that I have found to easily compare prior weeks or months.Finally, and this is no secret, the voice recognition app doesn't seem to work all that well and it is a battery hog.  I like the idea so I wouldn't scrap it, but it really sucks power when you have it activated.Not a bad device, it's easy enough to wear and it's not conspicuous, but I would really like to see this integrated into an actual website, with good security, where I could view my history over longer periods of time.",3
538,"I am a gizmo junky … try them all. I use my Apple Watch to track my walking so I don’t use Halo for that. I find it the best of all for sleep tracking because it can tell the difference between actually asleep and just lying still hoping to fall asleep, a situation I am too familiar with. I mostly don’t like what it reports in the morning but it is dead right. I also find the voice emotion report interesting and none of the others do that. I have consciously tried to lighten up so I won’t be quite the non-emotional speaker that Halo reported me to be. It works, sort of. These are things that other gizmos don’t have. My very favorite gizmo in the world, since you asked, are Bose hear buds, not sure that’s the name…block out snoring like you would not believe. Pricy but I’d crawl to get them with my last dollar.",4
539,"Final update. I am changing my review back to 1 star again.  On my last body scan at then 128 lbs with a 26 inch waist and wearing size small clothing it said I was overweight. I just got so discouraged and gave up working out and started binge eating to cope with stress. I gained 20 lbs. I threw the watch out and signed up for healthywager.  I've since gotten down to 132 lbs and am losing weight quickly.  I'll say again that this watch is not motivating. If facts and data were enough to motivate everyone to be at a healthy weight, we would all be at a healthy weight. Most people know they need to move more and eat less. It's behavior. People need encouragement and to be told they're doing well. A consultation with a behavior specialist would be a good idea for the next version. I like the heartrate monitor but my Fitbit did that also.______I am updating my review. As much as I dislike the features I mentioned previously, this watch may have saved my life.  My resting heart rate is usually 54-57 bpm as a lifelong athlete but about five days ago it jumped 9%. The watch alerted me that something may be wrong.  Each day it jumped more until yesterday it was 20% higher than usual and I felt like it was racing. Long story short I had a serious infection and was able to start antibiotics right away because I was on alert that something was wrong. For that I add 3 more stars.*""""""I will say the body scan is incorrect. I took two scans on the same day a few minutes apart wearing dark clothes vs light clothes and in the light clothes I was within the average range while in the dark clothes I was overweight.****The team behind this watch would have benefited from a consultation with a behavioral scientist. Come on, negativite points? Negativite reinforcement should be used rarely as it is often not as effective as positive reinforcement.  Additionally, everyone is at different levels. We should be able to set our own points goals to have the feeling of success and behavioral momentum that leads to improvement. Today I did three workouts to get to 140 points.  Then I worked an 8 hour day doing telatherapy and got negative points for that. Feel like going back to my fitbit.  (I also just realized it's 150 a week not 150 a day. No wonder it seemed so impossibly hard to hit that goal.)",1
540,"I really like the Halo. The band and main piece is comfortable. I've washed the fabric band by hand a couple times and it looks great. The app is easy to use although it's interesting that there is no Halo app for the Kindle... c'mon Amazon, it should talk to your other products.I started wearing a fitbit a few days ago just to see if I like it better. While I really love having the time display of the fitbit, I prefer the tracking of the Halo including the way it categorizes my activities and sleep quality. I like that I can easily add activity on the Halo band in case I wasn't wearing the band while I was exercising.I haven't used the tone feature so I can't comment on that.I hope Amazon can add a clock face and then I would really really think the Halo is perfect.",4
541,I enjoy the abb and the update to shopping list was much needed. Try the free six months  I kept it.,4
542,It didn't truly record sleeping patterns if you get up to use the bathroom it starts over,4
543,I’ve had this halo band and whoop band both on at the same time. For three months.There’s pros and cons.The cons how ever in my opinion are unnoticeable.So the Halo band does everything the whoop band (BIG PRO) from sleep/activity/heart rate monitor.. and they are nearly identical. From how long you were in deep sleep/ rem sleep/ light sleep. Literally the same.The only thing the halo band does not do are two main things. Just 2! Well 3.That is HRV.. which I could not comprehend at all on my whoop band. The other is the ability to be connected to other groups.. as in baseball players/weightlifting/powerlifting/runners etc. Whoop has that locked in. Until halo catches up.The last would be price per month. Whoop is 30 a month with a three month commitment. So that’s 90 off the bat. If you like it. Then keep paying 30 a month. Halo is 3.99 after you free trial and you have to buy it for 90. So in three months they are exactly the same price but for any longer then 3 monthsHalo wins.My complaint is halo needs to be taken off to charge/ Whoop does notAlso whoop will scratch anyone accidentally really often. Halo does not.It’s the little thingsThose are really the only difference in the two,5
544,"I am 6’3 240lbs and I got this on a whim.  I wanted to wear it on my ankle.  I read reviews that said you could but the strap was too small.  The strap is not too small, bought the L size and fits around my ankle (tightly) and still has room to Velcro the band once it’s on my lower calf.  I wear a size 12 EE for reference. I will tell you that this cannot track anything accurately at all while this is on your ankle. I realize it’s made to be on your wrist, but I took a chance.  Can’t blame the product- but you folks should know the information recorded while it’s on your ankle is completely wrong.  I says I’m way more active than I really am.  (95 percentile of all users when I work at a desk all day)  My heart rate is recording 110 BPM when I’m taking my morning poo then I checked my pulse and I’m around 60 BPM.  Might be a good product but NOT FOR ANKLE WEAR.",2
545,"I like the fitness band overall but there are definitely some things that can be improved. I got the rose band and I only take it off to charge it and wash my wrist occasionally, the rose band now looks black and I have only had it for a few months. The second thing is that I wish there was a way i could search through the programs and have more filters to choose from. The programs are very limited and its hard to find the right one without a search function. The third thing is my steps, I get jipped a lot because the band does not register if I am carrying something and not moving my arm back and forth and it doesn't track when I am grocery shopping because I am pushing the cart and not moving my arm back and forth. That is very frustrating. Lastly, the body scanner is hard to trust. I can take a scan with minimal clothes and then 5 min later with no clothes and the body fat is totally different. I also have used it every 2 weeks as suggested and have seen little movement in body fat percentage even though I can visually see a difference and I have been losing weight.",3
546,"Ok I'm a huge Amazon fan and I use a ton of their tech but when I saw this I wasn't sure if I was going to try it. Most fitness trackers are big on me since I have small wrists and I didn't have any that were very accurate. But since I have been sick and trying to be more healthy I thought I'd try this after I got the invite.First of all, it fits on my wrist comfortably and has been accurate with my steps. I even like that it detects tone, it gives me an idea of how I sound to other people and I like that. Do I worry about my privacy? No, I'm not that interesting and I have Alexa devices all over my house and car, so they already know about me. lolLike Everyone else, there are issues with tracking my sleep. I don't sleep well or at all at night or I get sick during the day and have to nap. It's been an issue so my sleep patterns are all over the place.  My Halo just marks it as being inactive and not sleep time.I also notice when I was wearing the band the area where the light hits was causing some irritation. I loosened the band a little and that seems to have taken care of the problem.Overall it's not a bad tool for me to have to get healthy. I like it better than the Fitbit.",5
547,"The devices concept is interesting but the execution is poor. The wearability of the device is a big issue for me. The band isn’t flexible and has no stretch abilities so it feels very clunky compared to similar devices. It also is supposed to sit above the wrist a bit but since my wrist is smaller than that part of my lower arm I end up having to cinch it more than I would like. The fabric band stays wet for a more considerable time than I’d like after washing my hands which I do many times a day currently. My skin has also reacted to the actual monitor piece of this device. It started with the skin becoming shiny and red and has progressed to three small cracks in my skin. I am concerned that with more use it will break down the skin further. (EDIT: It has progressed to my skin peeling. See added pic.) During Covid-19 this is a huge concern. This is after less than a week of use with several hour daily breaks for charging. That brings me to the next issue. The battery is woefully underperforming. If you plan to use all of the features, voice analysis especially, then plan on charging it on a daily basis. Why make a device that sucks up so much of its battery as to make features unusable? The charger is a tight clamping jaw like device and is really a pain compared to other chargers and one additional charger type that I must keep track of. Anyone with arthritis or weakness in their hands or even those who apply lotion throughout the day may find this difficult to manage. The body scan was interesting but like another reviewer mentioned, it has problems detecting and portraying larger women’s curves. We are a huge market for this type of device so we shouldn’t have been an afterthought for the body scan features. That should have been figured out in beta testing. The exercise points are motivating and a great feature. I just wish more time would have been spent on the execution of this device.",2
548,"Going to be returning my Halo. Here are my reasons:1. Wearing a device on each wrist is starting to bug me. (I know this is a personal choice, but I needed to know how the Halo compared to my Apple Watch)2. Tone is not all it's cracked up to be. It shows you %of types of tones it detects, and at what times, but doesn't tell you what you said, so basically it's of no use. I certainly don't have a memory to know at what exact time I said what.3. Step count seems to be off by as much as 1000 a day to my Apple Watch.4. There have been a couple of nights (only a few) where it started to count my sleep time about 20 minutes or so before I actually went to bed (I'm sure this is compliments of medicinal cannabis and being super relaxed) and then calculate ""awake time"" into other awake time when I'm actually getting around for bed. There is no way to adjust your actual in bed time.Now, there are a few things I absolutely LOVE about the Halo, which is making me not want to return it.1. No face. I can't check my progress unless I bring up the app. To me this is a good thing. I like just having it on and not having to ""check in"" with it, or look at messages, time, step count ...2. Weekly goal versus daily.  This is so much more life like! We have ""down"" days. With that said, it holds you accountable to how much time you are sedentary and counts that against you - that has been a HUGE eye opener. This is probably the main reason I want to keep it. I can only wish Apple will develop something like this too.Bottom line, if I had no other tracker, the Halo would be awesome. I was a FitBit user prior to my Apple Watch, and I would put it above that.Amazon has a great start, and I’m sure they will continue to improve it.",2
549,Seems pretty accurate in the sleep tracking and step counting couldn't get the tone to work. Overall really like the halo.,4
550,"The bulk of the products that Amazon creates are amazing. I love the Echo Shows and Dots. All have gotten better with each version. Maybe the Halo will be the same but I won’t be willing to try. I’ve had the Halo for five months now. As a concept I love it, the integration of different wellness aspects with the app are amazing. The Halo itself though is another matter, it more often than not doesn’t track my sleep and I am aware it’s sometimes a matter of how I sleep but it can’t always be that. My heart rate is often inaccurate compared to both my simple counting and my chest strap heart rate monitor. It also fails to track my activities, for example yesterday I ran 6 miles and it said I had not been active at all. I’ve been open minded and understanding that there are kinks to work out but it appears Amazon spent more time focusing on the app than the product. I’ll stick with my Garmin.",3
551,"I buy and love so many things from Amazon, it would take me days to leave reviews for everything.  So I usually only leave reviews for the best (and worst!) Items purchased.Well this Halo fitness band has to be one of the worst purchases I've ever made.The battery life is TERRIBLE.  It's constantly dying on me and is supposedly better if I don't use the tone detection function.  BUT, that is pretty much it's only distinguishing feature among fitness bands?!I've used Fitbits for the last 10 years.  When the most recent one died, I decided to try Halo.  But after a month of constantly having to charge it every 2 days, Halo has given me new appreciation for my old Fitbits.If this thing doesn't die from me using a hammer on it from frustration, I will await its natural death and go back to my Ex (Fitbit, that is).",2
552,"I know this device is still in a testing phase, but I have been using it for 6 months and I've yet to see an improvement.The device is clunky. For the first 4 months, I wore it on my wrist, and it aggravated me in my sleep. I also frequently developed a rash. I had to remove the band for an hour every day, clean it with an alcohol wipe, and treat my skin. I eventually switched to wearing it on my ankle, to see if it improved my step count, and it did. On my wrist, it only logged about 1/3 of my steps, counting me as sedentary most of the day, although I'm on my feet almost constantly. I guess I don't swing my arms enough.The app was SLOW to navigate, and crashed constantly.The sleep logging was always way off.I did appreciate the heart rate function. I found out I have an arrhythmia, after a resting HR above 150 got me a cardiac referral.The body scan was the main reason I purchased this device, and it was buggy and upset me. After dropping 10% of my weight, to trim up, the body scan calculated me as having added an additional 10% of body fat. That absolutely sucked and seriously bummed me out. I'm already at a healthy weight for my height and age, so I know the scan was messed up somehow.Then it started dropping my steps. I went from being a person that generally gets 8-10K steps a day, more on lawn mowing days, to logging 400 steps.I'm going back to my no-frills Fitbit. The charge lasts for a week, and it counts my steps.Halo might be worth it for the bells and whistles, if it worked properly.I'll check back in a year to see if they can bring it up to proper awesome Amazon standards.I really wanted to like this!",2
553,"I love the new Halo device. I just wish it was compatible and synchronized with other apps. Update 7/14/2021 ——After wearing the device since December, I’ve downgraded to three stars. Although the recent updates are definitely a step up, I’ve had issues were the device does not track my data or it does track my data, but later on in the day changes my data, for example, today I woke up, did a morning workout, went to work. This is a normal day for me, it tracked the data perfectly fine; however, when I synced it up again around noon, the device decided that I was up for four hours, went back to sleep, then woke up again after an hour. So, my morning workout points went away even though my calories burned still indicate a spike for that time frame. This is the fourth time this has happened to me. Overall, I know what I accomplished so in the grand scheme of things it doesn’t change that, but I want a device that reads as close to accurate as possible. Hopefully, this is a bug that can eventually be fixed. If not, I’ll probably go back to a Fitbit or maybe get an Apple Watch. I’ll be giving it another six months though to see what happens.",3
554,"I found the Halo extremely comfortable to wear day and night.  Barely noticed it was on my wrist.  The data (sleep, steps and BPM) was very accurate and helpful.But for me it just doesn't work in the practical sense of why I want a tracker.  I am not wed to my phone. It often is in a different room or floor of my house.  Having to remember to drag my phone around the house to see my step progress or BPM is just too annoying.  I just want to look at this thing on my wrist.And the final killer for me is that it tracks me being sedentary but has no reminder or way to tell me to actually get up and do something.I was very hopeful and I suspect future iterations will include other features, but for me it is just a pretty silver cloth bracelet with only limited usage.  But for folks who are on their phones constantly I would highly recommend.",4
555,"I love how easy the setup is! I was up running in about 2 minutes and after maybe 5 more minutes I had the voice and BMI setup. It is very comfortable on my wrist and I forget it is there most of the time. I have owned a Samsung, Fitbit, and Whoop. The Halo is more comfortable than both the Samsung and Fitbit and does a lot more than Whoop does.Battery life needs improvement. If you are running the lowest level of voice the battery only lasts about a day. Which leads me to the charging clip. I think the design could be a lot better. If you do not place the band just right, it will not charge. You must clip it and give the slightest pull of the strap to make sure it is seated properly. Once the battery life is fixed, it would be a cool idea of building in an LED watch face that you can see through the top of the strap or redesign the strap to include a watch face.",4
556,"Fantastic app and really interesting features. For example, the body fat 3D scanner is very cool and seems to work extremely well.Unfortunately, three problems bring down the score for this Amazon product in my opinion:1. The charging plug is horrible. Not sure if the design is bad or the connectors are just of poor quality but it’s extremely frustrating to get this thing perfectly positioned so it starts charging. I can’t even get my band to charge anymore so it’s kinda bricked at the moment 😭2. This thing really needs a screen. Glad the next version is being updated with one. Also, not a huge fan of the band material. Feels cheap. Much rather would have a plastic band instead. Again, seems to be addressed in the newest version which is great news!3. This is not a “make-or-break” issue for me but I would like Amazon to be a bit more open with my health data so other apps can track my activity too. My insurance health app gives me discounts the more active I am and this used to work really great with my Fitbit but not anymore with the Halo. None of my steps or activity can be synced since Amazon has designed the Halo as a closed health ecosystem. Not very consumer friendly in my opinion.Other than the three points above, this is an exciting new product for Amazon and I can’t wait to see what new features they start rolling out on their next version (Although I’m out if the charging plug stays the same. That thing has to go!).",2
557,"Mic will be on but it will not record data. Also having it on brains the battery quickly. It will need a charge just about every day.It can't be worn in the shower which is a drawback for me. I don't mind that there isn't a clock on it although the first two days I had it, I was checking my wrist.The charger is a bit cheap to me. It is always a weird and unnecessary game to get it in the right position so that the light on the band lights up.I like the colour and whatever the band is made of. It does not irritate my skin at all and the colour is appropriate for just about everything. I know this is a product review, but also the app is just meh. I feel like it could be cleaner in setup. You're presented with a lot of information that I feel should be hidden and only be visible if I click on an explanation button for example. I like how it tracks activity. I feel it is pretty spot on. I will probably keep it based on the sleep tracking which I really like, the movement tracker, and the body scanning system. I've always been curious about body fat percentage.",3
558,I really like this product but unfortunately it won't connect to phone via Bluetooth any more. I also wear an iWatch which is great for activity but the sleep function on the Halo is far superior. The heart rate monitor is great for a live view and the audio function is so-so. The audio tone function I give a so-so because while the data of the tones may be accurate if you're a person in a sales profession you may change inflections of your voice intentionally which doesn't make you a sad person. For a person who doesn't think much about their voice this may cause them to think the way the speak is wrong when you may change your voice to make a point. I've had it for 3 months and the Bluetooth connection stopped working and all Amazon tech support could do is refund me since the product is unavailable. I'd really like another when they become available again. I'd give it 5 stars if it still worked.,4
559,"The mobile app is loaded with great content, which can be frustrating to access due to difficulty navigating. The app frequently crashes. The mobile app does not offer much significant information as you cannot track well. Trends are not able to be spotted well. Weirdly distance isn’t tracked but steps are",3
560,"It has been a great experience with the Halo so far.I'm not sure why other reviews are worried about their data when you have the option to delete all the data that has been stored on the device to make the calculations.It even has an option for you to opt in and out of cloud storage if you're sensitive about that.If you're worried about it's using the built in mic to record to analyze your tone, you can press and hold the button on the band for 3 seconds to mute it (The LED will flash red when it goes on mute).The activity tracking is great. It is really accurate.I really like the sleep analytics that I get every morning.I have no issues with discomfort of the band. Along with the gray band that came with the Halo, I also got the sport band. So if you're experiencing any discomfort, try the sport band.I really like the variety of classes that's offered along with the membership. It's really cool to get options to do yoga and or cardio exercise and you have multiple resources within the app.Overall, I recommend the Halo band. I really like how I can control the data that's been collected to make calculations. I had a Fitbit not too long ago and if I remember correctly, I didn't have an option for any data purge with it.",5
561,"I'm an avid cyclist and dabble in kettlebell, sandbag and steel club work. Historically, I was an avid runner but after a visit to the Ortho, found out I've got arthritis in my right knee, so I began looking for an alternative to the ""serious"" GPS watches I've used for over a decade in favor of a less intrusive device. The Halo Band is perfect as it looks more like a bracelet/wrist band instead of the larger GPS watches I've consistently sported.On top of the barely-there feel and great sleep and activity tracking of the Band, the Halo membership has been a boon to my off-the-bike fitness. Using strength, barre, and HIIT classes has been a great experience, especially in the winter months when I'm not riding as often. I've been able to incorporate a scripted dumbbell + resistance band workouts to my kettlebell work and that's been a nice change.Sure, it doesn't measure V02, HRV recovery (yet), or a number of other metrics an avid runner/cyclist may want, but I'm not looking for that data anymore as for the past 10 years I've had it and not known what to do with it. The Halo Band is an excellent fit for my fitness journey and I couldn't recommend it enough!",5
562,Overall I like this tracker. I like the heart monitoring system and how it tracks my activity in more details than just steps. I like the app and how it gives you workout programs to do from as little as two minutes to over an hour. I like the tips and tricks and challenges it gives you to do to be healthier. I also like the body fat tracker and how you can adjust what your body would look like a certain percentages. I didn’t use the voice tone identifier as much as I thought I would and it eats away at the battery to quickly so I turned it off. The only thing I wish this band did was tell me the time. I also would like other options for bands. I saw they came out with bands that look more like watch bands so I will be purchasing to try it out.  I’m interested to see where Amazon takes this band in the future.,4
563,"The charger is terribly annoying to attach, it doesn’t give that much information, and it’s just annoying to wear another large band on my wrist.",3
564,"At first I hated this new fitness tracker. It didn’t work at all. I was super excited when it arrived in the mail and I immediately charged it and wore it to bed. The next morning I was upset to see it had died in the middle of the night. For the next 3 days I fought with the band to try to get it to hold a charge but nothing worked. I finally contacted Amazon and got a replacement 2 weeks later. At this point I was no longer excited. Now I have had the Halo band for a few days and I love it! The battery works great and so do all the other functions. The sleep tracker is by far my favorite function. It tracks your sleep so accurately and give you so much information. The fitness aspect is also great and very unique. It tracks your activities and your sedentary time (this is a new feature to me and really makes me want to get up and move more). It also gives you points for activities or takes them away if you don’t move enough. I’m insecure just like almost every other person in the world so the body composition isn’t my favorite aspect of the band. The Tone feature is pretty cool though and could be very useful to teachers, parents, bosses or just someone at work. Overall Amazon made a very unique and great product. I highly recommend this to anyone, even those not interested in it for the fitness aspects.",5
565,"Other fitness product owned: Fitbit Alta HRThere were a few characteristics of this product that got me real excited. 1. It was an Amazon product. 2. I had the ability to analyze my tone.Pros- Extremely comfortable. I am never tempted to take the halo off, and I don' take it off in my sleep either. I usually end up taking the fitbit off in the middle of the night.- I enjoyed the app interface and the concept that I'm gaining and losing points compared to just reviewing steps. This was a very motivational factor for me.- I enjoyed the partnerships with other companies like headspace.Cons- I have both anxiety and depression. I thought the ability to analyze my tone would help me build better relationships and learn more about myself. I come to realize that this isn't what I was technically looking for. Overall, the program stated that I sound or came across a certain way, but I couldn't recall the conversations I was having at those specific moments to be able to self-reflect. At the end of the day, it was just kind of depressing to be told that I sounded negative or low energy most of the day even if I didn't feel that way. Tonal perception also varies from person to person.- I know that I signed up for this knowing that the halo did not tell time. I was willing to sacrifice the screen, an alarm clock, notifications, and everything, BUT the one thing I still wish this product had was just the time.?- The halo always averaged 1000 more steps than my fitbit did for me on a daily basis. Do that with info what you will.Overall, I don't feel as though the halo offers enough for the price paid and the sacrifices of simplicity like telling time. The halo offers a great level of detail into metrics that you might actually not care to track. The data doesn't translate into effective information or really help take action.",2
566,"I really like the activity score. It makes me more aware of my sedentary time, and it’s encouraged me to take more walks and generally find more excuses to move. It seems more useful than a basic step count, which is what I’ve been used to with my Fitbit. I like looking over my past weeks’ scores and trying not to fall below my average.I’m finding the sleep info a lot more useful than the more basic info I used to get from my Fitbit Charge 2. One gripe is that I toss and turn a lot, so it has a hard time determining when I start trying to fall asleep. Sometimes I’ll be trying to fall asleep for 45 minutes, but it’ll say it took me 5 minutes to fall asleep. The app lets me know that this is a known issue, but I would love a way to let it know when I start trying so I can better spot trends with my sleep habits and successes.I don’t love the charger but I haven’t had any trouble placing it in the cradle or getting it to charge.The body composition tools are interesting and motivating.I haven’t used the Voice Recognition/Tone feature yet.I currently get about 6 full days and nights per charge.",5
567,"Preface - I'm an Amazon gadget nut. Between my home and office I have over 40 echos, shows, dots, plugs, autos. loops, etc, etc. My life is powered by Alexa.I purchased 4 halos (myself, wife, 2 kids). After almost 2 months of use we are returning. There are dozens of proven products out there with way more features for way less cost.Likes:- We all loved the fit and the band.- We all liked the sleep tracking and found it accurate and insightful- We all likes the tone tracking and found it insightfulNeutral:- Step count seemed inconsistent (we use a treadmill a lot)- Labs are a great concept but the video interface in the app is clunky and confusing. It feels tacked on and lacks basic intuitive features.Dislikes:- Zero interface with any of the popular fitness applications (stridekick, etc). That said it does have a whole TWO things it can connect to, Weight Watchers and John Hancock Vitality??- No friends/accountability features. We can't create a group, see each others progress, or create challenges. This is a must have for us (or at least the ability to push the data elsewhere, like almost every tracker out there)- Limited band selections due to the proprietary clip on design. I'd like to put it on my ankle when using the treadmill.- No sedentary alarm.- No public development roadmap so I can see if the features that the device should have are planned- A monthly fee? Come on now, we couldn't just add this to prime or make it a onetime cost?If you don't want the features listed above they you will probably love it. For me, unless I see announcements on updates, I'll add the Halo to the Echo Auto (Come on, a device in my car that requires my phone, LOL? Why wouldn't one just use the Alexa App?) in the category of things we just didn't need or were done better by others.",2
568,"I really like the Amazon Halo & it played a crucial role in my weight loss journey. The app is smooth and very easy to use, I like the feel of it. The product and data itself is fantastic, very well-tuned but definitely some room for improvement there. Unfortunately, the device started acting weird after a year of use.",3
569,"Love this this. Having no screen is great because you forget about it. I don't use live monitoring often because I know my body will enough to know when I'm ""in the zone"" so I don't mind not having it. When has a tracker with the calls, texts, live monitoring, etc I would check it often like ""OK only two minutes left, I can cut it short today."" or see texts and calls that distracted me. I dislike phones even though I use them. Emergency calls are nice but otherwise they're like drugs. Addicting and give a false sense of reward that keeps people from doing more in life (looking at you social media). I know, I know, you use your phone to maximize your life and need it for work and how dare I... I'm not talking to you. This is my opinion.I love all the features. Workouts. Meditations. And I've lost those pesky 15 lbs. Something that didn't happen when I had a screen on my wrist for years.",4
570,"I purchased the halo band since I have owned Fitbit trackers in the past and they were constantly failing after 1 year. I really liked the in-depth analysis of my sleep, 6 month free membership, body scan feature. I purchased the Halo band in December, 5 months later the sensor would not charge. I requested a replacement and received a refurbished sensor. I attempted to sync this sensor with the Halo app and it did not work. I phoned Tech support (always out sourced) and still unable to remedy the problem ( searching customer support manual for possible solutions). A refund was now necessary for this purchase but I was certainly appalled that it would ever be suggested that I could re-purchase another Halo!! Seriously, why would I? This has been the first complaint I’ve ever had with anything ordered from Amazon and this was surely a disappointment.",5
571,"I received my Halo when I signed up for weight watchers. I will be honest, I’m probably not the person that they thought of when they created this. I’m morbidly obese and I absolutely despise exercise. I needed to lose weight though, so I decided to wear it. I hesitated to write this review because I don’t use some of the features. I think the body composition would hurt my mental health so I haven’t tried it, even after losing 75 pounds I’m still scared. I didn’t need the tone thing to know that I sound like an ass most of the time. My Apple Watch does a great job accounting for my size and adjusting my goals accordingly. I don’t feel like the halo does that. I’ve wore them both at the same time and I far exceeded my Apple goal and was nowhere close to the halo one. I like that it has no screen though, it blends in more which I appreciate. I also have huge wrists and it fits great. I probably would’ve been disappointed if I paid this much for it, especially since there’s better options around the same price point.",3
572,"I wanted to like this product (owned for more than a year), reasonable price, decent app and good subscription price but unfortunately there are a number of things that keeps me from recommending.  The biggest issue is the heart rate monitor, it is no where close to accurate.  I've counted my heart rate during live workouts and it is recording at level that is 20-30% lower than my actual heart rate (recording 95-115 range when my heart rate is really 140 - 160.  No level of adjustment on the device on my arm gets it to be accurate. Since the system assigns intensity points to your work out based on those measurements, its not accurate tracking your activity. Unfortunately the app is also wonky, often disconnecting, though this occurs less than when I first got the product.",3
573,"I love the band. Bought it to track my steps and my sleep patterns.My one complaint is the charging mechanism.  If Jeff Bezos could fix this, I would buy several of the bands.  The charging mechanism is flakey so you have to keep fiddling with it every 10 minutes or so to keep charging. It is not something you can start charging, walk away for an hour, come back and your band is fully charged.  Come on,, Amazon do better.",4
574,"I was excited for this device to track overall activity as well as intensity of workouts but was ultimately disappointed with its accuracy problems.Unfortunately, it does not accurately count heart rate of 140 or above, even after resetting it as suggested by tech support, so it can't accurately track workouts. It also gives a daily calorie expenditure estimates that seem WAY higher than expected, going as high as 2,600 on days where I'm not very active and would expect 1,800-2,000 based on my BMR.The ""tone"" feature is a neat idea but doesn't actually turn out to be very useful or informative, since the analysis is delayed and you've forgotten what that particular moment was by the time it notifies you about it. It's not worth the battery loss.I can't compare the body composition with the fancy machines, but a composition scale and caliper measurements both estimate about 10% lower than the Halo.The sleep tracking seems to be pretty accurate, though it does have gaps sometimes.The app is user-friendly and easy to figure out. The ""lab"" workout programs are easy to fit into the day and they target specific skills nicely. Overall, the Halo is a good concept, but it lacks the accuracy to make it a good product.",3
575,"UPDATED 1/6/21 - Original comments below the line are still valid.After I left my original two star review I was called twice by Amazon and Customer Service even left a voicemail about my review. Customer Service followed up with an email as well saying they were sorry about my experience and to reach out to them. The email they sent specifically said I could just ""reply to the email"" for a response. I had, and still do not have, a clear idea why they are so interested in getting in touch with me but I responded to the email. The email bounced and said it was not set up to receive emails. I reached out to Amazon Help on Twitter about the inconsistency and they told me Facebook was having issues. I didn't try to use Facebook. Then they sent me to the generic Amazon Customer Service site which requires I explain what my issue is. I could not provide a clear answer because Amazon specifically reached out to me. I think the Halo is a good idea with poor implementation and terrible battery life that makes it pointless right now. I have no real issue with the product beyond the fact that it's made with a bad battery life. So after trying to explain that to Amazon via IM I got re-directed, and re-directed, and the issue was escalated, and now I'm back to square one where they're telling me they don't know what my issue is and to please explain. So anyway, I'm downgrading my review because not only was this product just not well implemented but the unsolicited customer service was also beyond irritating to deal with.------------------------------------Honestly a great idea but execution and implementation have not been great. The tracker can’t hold a charge, which is incredibly shocking given how lo-tech it is. I’d rather wear a smart device that can do much more and charge that every 18 hours than this band that can’t do anything and still needs a charge every 18 hours. The app is fine but there’s no way to deep dive or understand the underlying data. If my tone isn’t happy - I should be able to review the specific tone analyzed and correct the data. Or, another example, if it says I was awake at night for a prolonged period I should be able to correct that if it was untrue. My body weight image analysis is also really up and down - in two weeks I went up 2.2% and then went back down 2% the next time which makes me question how accurate the photo option even is.",1
576,"I used this is conjuction with and comparing to a Galaxy watch active 2, and a Bellabeat Leaf.The features that are supposed to set the Halo apart are the body scan and tone... I disabled Tone after two days because it ate up battery and wasn't seeming to give me any real insight. Body scan has not worked for me either, as I have lost 15 pounds while wearing the Halo and it shows no change to body fat. Sleep and step tracking are fine, pretty much in line with any other device. The labs are nice, some of them, but some feel haphazard and sloppy, so I guess it depends what you pick. Overall I wish I'd returned this thing when I had the chance, since I might as well use my smart watch.Good: solid sleep and step trackersBad: hate Tone and body scan, don't want to pay for the lab content, no food tracker, doesn't sync with any other fitness app or smartwatch",4
577,"I’ve been surprised by how well this little band has worked for me.  I have now had it for 6 months and it has held up well.  I primarily purchased this for tracking my steps each day and it does a great job.  I have found the Halo to keep a decently accurate step count and it lasts a long time on a single charge when I wear it during the day.  The band is sturdy and has held up well.  I’m very active - I garden, hike, have chickens etc. so it has to put up with a lot of different environments and it has done a great job.  I don’t use it for sleep tracking - I am already aware the my sleep is horrible and I think it would just make me discouraged.  I haven’t used it for body scanning-yikes! That would be creepy and depressing so I cannot comment on those aspects.  I do like the app interface and find it easy to use.  I have used Fitbits for years and I actually like this band much better.  It is more breathable, sturdy and unassuming.  It certainly isn’t flashy but that is a plus for me.  I suppose it is all about what you want it to measure.  I will certainly get another when this one has lived out it’s life.",5
578,"I really wanted to love this band and I do love some of the features. First, it’s the most comfortable fitness tracker I’ve ever worn. It doesn’t catch on my sleeve and never came undone accidentally. Second, I love the sleep data it provides. I’m an insomniac and I found the sleep tracking detail to be really informative. Third, I really like the tone data. I felt it helped me be more mindful of how I talk to my kids, especially in a time like this where they are in virtual school and often need to interrupt my work for help. What I did not like, and this is ultimately the deal breaker for me, is that this device doesn’t track your actual workouts. For example, it tracks my heart rate and intensity of exercise during my run, but doesn’t tell me how far or how fast I ran. I usually track that data for my running journal to help me improve. I really don’t think this is made obvious by the description and I hope they update it. If Amazon could incorporate that I’d give it a second chance. I tried wearing this and my tracking band simultaneously to have the benefits of both but it’s just too much hassle keeping up with both charging schedules, etc.",3
579,"As someone returning to fitness and health tracking, this band has been great to help build awareness of my current abilities and where I want to focus to progress forward. I got the band as an early release and it was discounted while in Beta, but I've loved it and not having a screen has been one of my favorites. The body scans and mobility scans have been very helpful too.I've read other reviews with struggles with charging, heart rate, comfort, and step tracking, I've not personally had any problems with it. It seems to accurately measure my activity points as well. I'm not gentle on my hands/wrists and my band has taken a beating - dishwashing, paddle boarding, weight training, gardening, cat chewing on it, etcMy original device just had the back pop off so I'll be ordering a new one. It slid back into place so will be fine until my new one arrives, but it's no longer waterproof. That has been the only issue with it I've had, and honestly after a year of hard use, I'm not complaining. I'll get the extended warranty this time though.",5
580,"I'm in no way diminishing the feelings of the users who complain about being demotivated by the Amazon Halo, I'm just here to say I'm not one of them. If you want a ""less smart"" fitness band that will purely give you your stats and send you in your way, opt for one more cost efficient. This band was made for people like me. I'm overweight and always trying to increase my activity. Can I do it without the Halo? You bet. Is my experience better using the Halo? 100% Let's get down to it:I've had the Halo since the beginning of January 21. I started with the rose gold band and that's the only thing I dislike about the Halo. The color was beautiful but it got dirty easily and I found myself constantly washing it. I forked out 25 bucks for a sleeker looking lilac colored band and I love it. I wore it tight around my wrist for the first 3 months and have the marks to show for it. After learning that it doesn't need to constantly be flesh against the skin, I lightened up.The Halo does a great job at tracking, all around. When I first received it, I was astonished at just how little sleep i was getting. How many interruptions I experienced during the night hours.",5
581,"It's comfortable to wear. And I haven't had any technical problems with it. It does however need some tweaks in how it tracks and in the settings and options in the app.Not sure why people are having battery charge issues. I recharge once every couple of days. Granted I don't use the Tone option as I feel that is a useless feature. And that does drain battery.It should give your base temperature that it is saying you slept like 1° cooler or hotter than. There should be a way to actually turn off the Halo. It doesn't track steps as well as it should. Seems to not track steps if your arm doesn't swing as you step. Like when you're pushing a shopping cart. There should be a better sleep tracking, as in when you actually go to bed and wake up. If I'm watching tv in the evening, then go up to bed, it will usually track that hour or 2 as I was in bed, because I was relaxed and not moving. Then when I get up to go to bed, it registers it as a disturbance. It should allow me to actually set the time I went to bed and got up, then it can adjust itself to only consider those hours.I'm sure there will be new versions in the future, but those of us who already own one should NOT have to pay a full price to upgrade.",5
582,"This band/fitness tracker is great for what it costs! The app is easy to use and simple enough. All of the content on the app is pretty helpful too.I do wish the band itself was a little more stretchy and fit more like an athletic band. I find myself constantly having to pull the band up and repositioning it after sliding down my wrist when doing strenuous activity.With a better band, it would get 5 starsIt would also be great if Amazon would come out with some new color variations for the fabric band. I’d give it 5 stars then too",4
583,"I liked this product very much and it was so friendly to use, keeping track of my habits and helping me improve was easy with this product, but it started failing about 4 months in, it started by disconnecting from my app and not letting me reconnect it, then it stopped recognizing my voice and I kept making sure it was well set up but it would work and last was that I took it swimming after 8 months of owning this product and it stopped working permanently. I liked the product very much, I liked how it kept track of my health I wish it had worked better.I called it to have it repaired and Amazon decided to refund me the cost of the product.Doesn’t mean all the bands are going to be defective, I’m sure mine was one in a thousand",4
584,"Initially fairly impressed. Sure, the band could use some work--it readily absorbs moisture and takes a while to dry out, making the Halo a little uncomfortable to wear. The charging clip is annoying--you have to fiddle with the Halo to get it to engage pretty much every time (unlike, say, your average smart watch which easily and reassuringly clicks onto a magnetized charging base with some semblance of authority).For the most part, the device seems fairly accurate; the sleep guide is interesting, although I'm not entirely sure what I'll do with that information. The activity tracking seems on point. The ""labs""--various self-improvement programs offered through the app--vary from marginally useful to utterly inconsequential. Most seem fairly superficial and, again, I'm not entirely sure they're engaging enough to make a positive impact on your habits. I suspect they might improve as the platform ramps up to speed.However, concerningly and rather suddenly, after a week of use, the Halo completely stopped pairing with the app. As there is no way to use the device absent the app (there's nothing but a few lights on the Halo itself), this renders the Halo into a solid Top 3 podium finisher in the Ugly Wristwear competition, albeit with no meaningful functionality to offset its aesthetic shortcommings.In trying to resolve the issue, the usual Amazon troubleshooting nightmare applies. It turns out the Halo is utterly inert absent the charging clip, so (apparently) one needs to carry the charging clip around on the off chance your Halo misfires (as it did so after only one week, I have to worry that this will be a semi-regular event) in order to have any chance to get the Halo back on track.What follows is the usual ""Turn it on/off"" sort of help which escalates into ""Let's reset the Halo, uninstall/reinstall the app, unpair/pair the device"" and you're hopefully back on track. Honestly, if this is turns out to be any sort of regular occurrence, I can't see the frustration being worth the benefit.",2
585,"UPDATE: Now that my trial subscription expired I can see just how bad this band is. I knew some of the more novel features like body comp and tone of voice would lock but I didn't realize just how neutered the activity and sleep features would be. Attached for example are screen shots of those screens.  The activity tracking is downgraded to a simple pedometer and the sleep data is cut down to the bare minimum of how long you slept.  I thought this was a reasonably competitive band with some novelty features locked behind a subscription but it turns out that it's laughably bare bones without that sub and doesn't even begin to justify the initial price tag without.Original three star review below:The halo looks nice and stylish. I like the design of the band and the no notch design for tightening it. If you don't need a watch, a good looking band is much nicer than a cheap looking screen you'd get on competing fitness bands. As long you keep the tone of voice feature turned off it has nice battery life. The sleep tracking works well, pedometer seems fine. The photo based bodyfat% is novel and while unflattering, I have to admit it's likely more accurate than bioelectrical impedance devices, tape measuring methods or skinfold calipers in most hands.Having said that, I have had to give it a factory reset once when it could no longer sync with the phone and the charging clip is a consistent annoyance. It takes a significant bit of fidgeting to get the charger to line up right and actually work. The app leaves a bit to be desired and seems like an overall downgrade from my previous band's app(a Fitbit charge 2).  As for that tone of voice feature? It's mildly interesting info to get though even set at the most frequent sampling it doesn't catch enough to really be of use and no matter the sampling frequency, it drains the battery far more than it's worth. I played with it a couple weeks before permanently turning it off.I don't see the device offering enough advanced features to warrant the $4 subscription after the initial 6 months either. At the discounted beta price of $65 this band was a good value as a budget fitness band. Unfortunately I don't think it justifies the $100 price tag given other options on the market, especially when some features require a subscription down the road.",1
586,"I bought a halo on Early Access. I installed it on an Android phone. At first, I could not get the Tone feature to work. I tried reading the passages given multiple times, but I kept getting the error that the device could not hear me.  Then I tried getting it to work on an iphone running the latest iOS version. Bang! The setup worked just fine and I have the Tone function working. I don't know if the app and device work better on iOS, or whether iOS bluetooth function works better than Android, or whether the band needed a factory reset out of the box. But the device seems to work fine now. I like how the device doesn't have a display. That way I can wear a regular watch on my dominant wrist and the Halo band on my other wrist.  I don't really need the body scan function on the app.  But so far, the device works well. Seemingly better on iOS than Android, but YMMV.,",4
587,"I have no complaints so far. This is one of the best. I live by Apple and love the Apple watch. But sometimes I want to wear something formal while at the same time I love tracking my movements and sleep more importantly. Apple watch has to be charged everyday. I don’t like draining any of my things to the max, so I charge the Halo every two days which after 100%, in 48 hours it’ll be at only 70%. Charge it in the shower and 20 minutes later it’s back to 100%. The tracking is accurate. I don’t use the tone, I don’t think I find it important. Body tracking seems interesting unsure if it’s accurate. Everything really is awesome.",5
588,"I have been using the device for a few months to track my fitness/weekly motivation and as someone very active in the gym I set my weekly goal to 600pts (150pts is the recommended for an active individual).  I have almost constantly hit my goal and on occasion had to program in some activities manually because on back day I remove the device from my wrist in order to use wrist straps and sometimes forget to put it back on before cardio.Overall the device works good and keeps a basic log of your activity level to keep you in line without distracting you with digital notifications or the need to take selfies, etc.  The only thing it may need tweaked is how many points are credited for certain activities, especially when manually adding as it basically views time on an arc trainer with the same point amount as walking which couldn't be further from the truth exertion wise.",4
589,"I wanted a device similar to a Fitbit, but without a lot of bells and whistles. I loved that the Halo was simple, kept track of sleep, stress, steps, etc and wasn't a fancy watch with overwhelming features I already have on my other devices. At first, I thought the Halo fit the bill. But...Out of the box it's been both frustrating and disappointing. It was somewhat easy to setup, but putting on your wrist requires it to be ""just so"" and perfectly positioned or it won't register anything and it doesn't warn you in any way if you don't constantly check the app to make sure it's working right. The charger is equally temperamental with regard to positioning. A nanometer off and the whole thing is tosh.The sleep tracker is limited by time parameters. It only registers sleep between a certain number of hours, so if your schedule is non-traditional like mine, it will never be accurate. Even when I am sleeping between the available hours, it's still not terribly accurate.The step counter is completely off. It's not even remotely accurate, so one can't rely on it for that purpose at all.The Tone feature not only drains the battery like mad, but also doesn't interpret my voice patterns very accurately, even after a few months of getting to know my voice.There is no heart rate monitor, which is unfortunate, as it was one of the things I had hoped to track.The ultimate disappointment was that the whole thing suddenly stopped working three months after I bought it. It didn't even last through the free trial membership. It won't charge or connect anymore, though I have taken very delicate care of it. Amazon will not refund it because it's over the time limit and now I have to wade through the warranty nonsense. I don't particularly want another one, as it really has been a disappointing device all around, but the alternative is tossing it in the rubbish bin.",2
590,"I own both the Fitbit Versa 2 and an Apple Watch (series 5) but I much prefer this. Why? These are my top 3 reasons.1. There are no screens, so it's not distracting. I can wear it all day and night with no issues.2. It helps track my sleep in no way my Apple Watch or FitBit can.3. The tone function is what blew me away. I had no idea how I sound when I talk, and I love that it can pick up on that and guide me on the ways I sound.I haven't done the body scan as I don't think I need to at this moment, however, I will use that function when I'm ready. I've had zero issues with the app and I prefer to track it on my phone when I'm ready instead of always looking at a watch.The profile is much smaller than the Apple Watch and FitBit and I love that.  I also love the free 6-month trial and I'm sure I'll subscribe once it's over.CONS: The battery life isn't that great when you're using the Tone function. I've had to recharge roughly about every day and a half, but it charges pretty fast so it's not been an issue thus far.OVERALL:This is great for those who don't want that annoying screen on their hands, looking for a low-profile tracker with great features. I highly recommend it.",5
591,"Second Update 2/16 - I finally got through to a human customer service agent  via the phone and Amazon refuses to honor the 1 year warranty on the device.  The best they could do is offer me a $20 credit towards a new one.  $20 wouldn't even come close to buying a new one. Why have a 1 year warranty if you're not going to honor it when something truely goes wrong with a device.  Thankfully I was part of the early adopter group so I didn't pay full price but still, it's terrible they are not supporting their product. I stand firm on my opinion  - don't waste your money on this device.  - now I just need to cancel the monthly halo membership 😑---Update - -- within 3 minutes of posting I had two missed calls and an email from Amazon because of this review - The email stated I could respond to the email but when I did it was kicked back as the email they sent it from does not accept incoming emails --- whomp whomp.Original Review -I purchased the Halo band because I was excited for the band to listen to my tone and help provide insight into my tone so I could improve conversations. I also liked that it did not have a clock face or receive notifications.  After 4 months of use, and NEVER getting it wet, the mic on the band seems to have a mind of its own when it wants to work or not.  Even though I ensured the mic was not muted, some days I get feedback, some days I do not.  The LEDs also stopped working - there are supposed to be different colors (green, red, blue, purple, orange, white) which mean different things.  The only color I get is white. I factory reset the band several times with no change.  I opened a case with Amazon support, received a case number and a promise to follow up within 3 days - NOTHING. More than a week went by and so I followed up with support - despite having a case number, no one knew anything and kept bouncing me around to a different agent.  I think they transferred me to about 5 different people who ""could help"" but couldn't.  I can't get a refund because it is beyond the return people but Amazon is not honoring the 1-year warranty  -This lump of useless plastic is a waste of money.",1
592,"Let me start off by saying that I actually enjoy using this Halo band. However, I wish it was more practical for people like me who don't work ""typical"" work hours. I wake up at 1:30 am for work, return home at 9, sleep from 10 to noon, and the sleep feature doesn't reflect that. I wish it were more catered to those of us who work for Amazon, at Hospitals... for first responders... and for other essential workers. It cuts my sleep hours and it doesn't record when I go back to sleep after a certain time. I haven't tried the tone and body features yet, But I'll gradually move into the other features  once I feel a bit more comfortable with getting into all of that. I don't hate it, but I can be improved, which I'm sure it will be.",4
593,"I love this product. I did find myself getting bored of it for a little bit, however I went right back to it after a while. This product does exactly what it is supposed to. I find it very comfortable as I wore bracelets through most of my youth and I have an issue with how bulky watches are. I don’t get the reviews about it moving or being too tight. I haven’t had a single issue with that. I love the BMI scale as it gives me a goal- no matter how accurate- and the programs are something you’d typically pay 200-400 dollars for which I absolutely love and utilize. The tone examiner is incredible due to the ability to monitor your positivity in your voice. I find myself being very negative through the day and the tone option reminds me to be more positive at times. The heat best one is the one I am most  skeptical  of, and that’s just because I don’t feel it matching while I watch it on the app. I can’t wait for more updates to come to this tool as I think it’s wonderful. No irritations no issues the app is very smoothly running. I give it a 9/10 just because I find it a bit repetitive. Otherwise over all and amazing fit band!",5
594,"I’ve had the Halo band for about 2 months now. I wear it daily (except when it needs to charge - which is an extremely slow process and needs to be done at least 1x every few days).If you plan to wear this for any type of activity where you sweat (which is kind of the point), don’t bother buying. Despite washing the band regularly, it started to smell after about a couple weeks. Regardless of how often I wash it now, it smells awful.It also made my skin blister in the area where the tracker sits on my wrist.Now to the actual functionality: The app is pretty decent overall and simple to navigate. I like how you can open the app to get a quick heart rate read or see things like max heart rate in a given day, week, etc.In terms of accuracy, I’m not sold.The way it tracks intense, moderate, light, and sedentary activity is way off.Sleep tracking is way off - if it’s nighttime and you’re sitting on the couch or laying down and relaxing, it gets tracked as sleep.If you have a late night and don’t fall asleep until sometime in the early morning, however, it incorrectly tracks your sleep as sedentary activity. So if your schedule varies and you work late night or overnight shifts, your sleep isn’t accounted for properly.Overall the concept is great but the execution isn’t there yet. I bought this because I wanted a screenless activity tracker, but it’s too bulky, the design is lacking, and it’s an eyesore on your wrist….in addition to all of the other downsides mentioned above. Not worth the money.",2
595,"The Halo is a pretty decent product, especially for the price. It does a nice job of tracking steps, heart rate, calories burned and sleep. Comparable products, such as the Fitbit, run into the hundreds of dollars, while the Halo is less than $100. The app is pretty good and offers all sorts of advice and additional activities to improve your life. Battery life is decent - I can usually go five days on a charge, with the voice recognition off. Probably closer to two days with the voice recognition on. But what drives me crazy is the charger. It's truly horrible. I have to constantly jigger the Halo in the charger to get it to charge, and I've seen a lot of similar reviews, so I'm not the only one who feels this way. It's incredibly frustrating and I'm truly shocked that a company as successful and resourceful as Amazon would allow this to happen. Would I get the Halo again? Honestly, I probably would because it goes what I want for the price. The charger issue may not seem like a big deal -- and it may not be to some - but buyer be ware.",3
596,"I was excited about this product at announcement and now after a bit over a month of using it, I have some mixed thoughts.I like that it's an unobtrusive tracker unlike my fitbit and garmin watch.I like the tone analysis feature although find it spotty in it's pickup unless I activate real-time via the app.Battery life isn't very good but it has seemed to improve as time has gone on (first few days the charge only lasted a day... But now I might be able to use it for sleep tracking one night in addition to a day of tone analysis. If you turn tone analysis off then battery lasts longerMaterials are nice but I worry about them for exercising so I don't usually go for a run or anything with it on. However, I like that it focuses on active minutes vs stepsBody composition is a bit silly as it is only through the app so no connection to the tracker.",4
597,"I liked it, especially the sleep tracking.  The way it tracks movement by score certainly got me moving more.  Ultimately I went back to an Apple Watch though because: I spent a lot of money on it; I need to wear a watch still; and I didn’t like being tethered to my phone during workouts like I had to be with the halo.Maybe the halo view would’ve been a better choice for me.",4
598,"I wear a Fit Bit Versa 2 on my dominant wrist and my Halo on my non-dominant wrist.In 4 months I have had all of 2 minor issues, one, it shares with the FitBit.  If you do not have an internet connection, like for instance you are in the middle of the ocean for day on end because of you occupation, it will not sync and its memory is limited and apparently unpublished or very difficult to find.The second issue was more recent, it ""appeared"" to stop charging as the light would not illuminate.  After talking with Amazon and conducting a reset it has returned to normal and no data was lost.Other thoughts, I like the fabric band and the narrow width of the device, I also appreciate its low profile lack of screen.  I don't need visual feedback on both arms, one is just fine, if I am that interested, opening the app is not a chore.I have not tried the body fat feature but I have used Tone since day one and it does remind me to think about how others are hearing me.Overall, very impressed, numbers between the 2 devices (FitBit & Halo) are nearly the same day to day, sleep, activity, steps, etc.The whiners who gave this 1 star, clearly either didn't read anything, are tech unsavvy, or angry at Amazon for reasons unknown.",5
599,Whole concept is great. When it did work correctly I loved it. However in 3 weeks only registered a whole nights sleep about 50% of the time . When you read trouble shooting it says may be to tight or too loose. Adjusted many different times never helped. It did seem to register activity great as I cycle and and go to gym. In that way I loved it. Now to the app. 3 times in 3 weeks I would open app and it was like the very first setup again. I would have to resubmit all my info . Then it would not pair back to the band until I got home to the charger and plug in to do initial set up from the beginning. I will say we bought one for myself and one for my spouse and the 2nd one works flawless. I did contact customer service as soon as I asked for assistance they said someone would call back in 24-48hrs but never received help. So one is in the trash one works great.,2
600,"First, I want to note that in the first months that I had the Halo, Amazon did not allow reviews (UNTIL THE RETURN WINDOW WAS OVER). Now I see that they do so here is my review:1) It just loses sync for no apparent reason. Often. There is a helpful message across the top of the app: ""Double press band button to sync."" That never works. Ever. Each time I have to re-pair it with bluetooth which, as you probably know, is a process.2) Sleep tracking: this was the main reason I got it. It doesn't track sleep accurately. I know this because it often says I was asleep at times when I was not. Other times I will have had terrible sleep (as in woke up, walked around, etc.) and Halo says I was sound asleep.3) Voice recognition: I'm pretty aware of when I'm angry or happy, so this was not very useful--also, even if you find it useful, it just cherry-picks a few moments. It's not comprehensive, even if you allow it to do more (thus draining the battery faster). It's a gimmick.4) Heart rate: guess it tracks your heart rate? And you can see that live? Checking your pulse is not that innovative, but it's something. I will assume that it's accurate just for fun.5) Body scan: OK, this was vaguely humiliating but I think it's interesting if the app were to do anything with it. I would like to see myself change over time.6) Content: Please. Nothing you can't find on Men's Health or Prevention or Livestrong.com or a hundred other health sites. Nothing is actually connected to your data, so there's nothing actionable. Like with the ""tone"" (of voice) module, there's content called ""Boost your mood with a break"" - not tied to your data, just a ""synergistic"" tie-in with Headspace.7) Steps: totally inaccurate. Misses 45 minute walks regularly. Yes, I'm wearing it correctly.For some reason I still wear it; I like seeing how many steps I've taken even if it's not accurate. I also have a foolish pride that says I have to use it because I paid for it.But honestly, this is garbage. You'd probably be better off with a knockoff fitbit and a subscription to MyFitnessPal or something similar. It would definitely be less expensive and you wouldn't be giving all your health data (no matter how flawed and inaccurate) to Amazon.",1
601,I love that it offers many videos to encourage movement but as far as the steps they are way off I wear 2 devices and check to see how accurate they are. Halo band is way high. I love my band don’t get me wrong . But beware your not moving as much as it says.,4
602,Same activity and two very different points!,3
603,"I wanted to track my sleep pattern, but it doesnt always record like it should.",4
604,"This is the first tracker I’ve worn on a regular basis. This is superior to my iwatch, which I wear running, in that the charge lasts a long time & is quick to charge. So I could wear it all day & night & then recharge while doing yoga, so I got an accurate picture of sleep. I like that it doesn’t have a watch to protect. Frankly, I don’t want or need one. I wish the sleep tracker accounted for naps? Not sure why that doesn’t count. The tone analysis is more of a novelty. It counted voices on tv shows or podcasts, so it’s hard to take it seriously. I wore it everyday for about 8 months then the back came off while I was putting in on one day. It had been glued on & just gave out. I was so disappointed, because I really did like it. I have looked for similar trackers, but they all seem more & I may actually buy another with device protection this time…..",3
605,"I returned it after 3 weeks.-The Tone AI models are sexist. I sounded ""irritated"" or ""annoyed"" every time I read books softly to my child at bedtime. Or I sounded ""bored"" during work meetings. I can almost hear Jeff Bezos whispering in my ear to smile more.-The battery life is crazy short. Understanding that it has more functionality than my fitbit, it still shouldn't require multiple charges a week. Plus it doesn't charge quick enough for it to not disrupt my day. (Amazon suggests charging while you make dinner. That's a much harder routine to interject behavioral changes into vs. jumping in the shower or going to sleep, neither of which practically work for recharging.)-I was excited by the gamification hooks mentioned on the detail page but in actuality, there is no ability to customize to your own goals or routines. I never got anywhere close to their goals because I'm working from home in a rainy location all day. At least with Fitbit I can set my own goals to stay motivated. I felt worse about myself after 3 weeks of using this device. The opposite of effective gamification.-The device itself does absolutely nothing to contribute to your body fat analysis; they could have that app completely separate from this. Nonetheless, they need independently-verified clinical trials to claim that it's more effective than every other method which indicate lower BMI.-Unlike fitbit and other silicone bands, it became very uncomfortable as my body expanded and contracted throughout the day (and especially at night) - but it didn't work correctly unless tightly securedAdding a star for the price point and the fact that it's fairly discreet. The step counter lags a bit in update so I couldn't immediately measure whether it was capturing my activity accurately. But I appreciated the balance  in weighing how vigorous the activity is. (the example they use is 'should you get less credit for going up the stairs 2 steps at a time?')",2
606,"So far, it has exceeded my expectations. The mobile app is intuitive, easy to use and easy to check when I’m in a hurry. I enjoy the doing the suggested programs and I like that the reminders/prompts go to my phone instead annoying me on the device. Since it does not have a visual face, I’m not obsessed with looking at it. With tone turned off, the battery lasts a few days and it charges quickly while I shower. It is supposed to be water resistant but why constantly test it when it’s a great time to charge it or let the band air out. I don’t lose much activity motion time washing my hair. Lol The sleep tracking was much better than my previous tracker, showing deep, light, rem sleep and how long it takes to fall asleep. Superb accuracy and I check that daily as it also records my wake times and sleep disturbances. It also tracks your highest and lowest heart rate and you have the option of live tracking during a workout or as a bio feedback type meditation. The tone feature was fun to use but I have a low voice and it doesn’t rate very positive emotions for me unless I speak in a high pitched tone as if speaking to a puppy. I think people really do hear my voice that way, even when I’m happy so it’s probably accurate. Overall, a great deal for the price. Very pleased.",5
607,"I've been looking for a replacement for my Jawbone for years. A competent modern fitness tracker with all the advanced bells and whistles of an apple watch, without the screen and endless notifciations of an apple watch.You see, I consider myself one of those weird ""Watch"" people. I love my watch collection, i love my vintage Casio watch, I love my swiss mechanical watches. And I love not wearing the same watch every day.I also love tracking my fitness and sleep and seeing my progress over time. The only way I can currently do that is with my apple watch, or with a fitbit, or garmin, etc etc etc. The issue is that they're all marketing themselves as watches. I dont want a watch, I want a fitness tarcker.Enter the Amazon Halo, a fitness tracker that isn't a watch. Looks like a normal bracelet, has ALL the features a fitness tracker has, won't make me look like a lunatic wearing two watches.But there are some catches:1. Amazon seems to believe you've never tracked your fitness before the halo existed. So if you want to say, import your data into your Apple Health, Garmin, Nike, Fitbit, etc etc etc apps. You're out of luck. It's amazon or bust for Amazon.2. HR and Step count are not enough for the price: It's a race to the top with Apple etc. Out of the box we expect more: Heart Rate Variability, Oxygen Saturation, GPS, vo2 max all come standard in 6 year old apple watches. A device with a similar form factor and no screen should presumably have more features but it doesnt.3. The BMI feature isn't even really a feature of the actual device, it's a feature of an app and it could not be more incorrect. Body fat calipers are less than 5 bucks on Amazon and will give you a more accurate reading of your BMI. A quick google of your BMI % + Gender will show you what your body looks like.4. The fabric band is stiff, itchy, cheap: Again. Fitness trackers are racing to be the most stylish, the most comfortable. Amazon barely tried with this one.5. Charging is a disaster: They give you this clip that is awkward to plug in, and my contacts never truly come in contact with the device so it charges 5% and loses it's charge quickly afterward.I will be returning this device. This aint it.",1
608,First off I have had a fit bit and a galaxy watch. I have had the halo watch October 22nd of 2020.  I was tired of having to download apps and seeing messages and phone calls. I know you can disable this feature but I wanted something accurate and not a child's watch without a watchface. The Halo is amazing! First off the body composition is amazing! I have tried scales and BMI calculators and the hand held ones and this is by far the best. Second the sleep is great! I like that it rates it. Also I use the tone and I LOVE IT. It is one of the best things I've ever used! I can see when I am negative or positive and determine what or who I was having affect me this way. The tone is amazing and I've never seen any other watch do this. I am low maintainance on technology and this is perfect. I am teacher so no annoying dings or rings or buzzes interrupting my teaching. By far would recommend to anyone who is okay with not getting updates from their phone 100% of the time. I like the bands and the look of it as well. The mobile app is so easy as well and I love the habit tracking! I charge it every morning and it is fast charging and it could probably hold two days but just in case I just do every morning.,5
609,I wish it was a little bit more accurate.  It misses a few things ( steps etc) also wish it took BP.,4
610,"I broke my neck in March, and since then I have gained some weight and I feel like my hips have lost some mobility. Now that my neck is healed I am going to try to get into a more healthy lifestyle. I LOVE that this assesses mobility and tailors your exercises to help with your specific needs. It shows your live heart rate and also your heart rate trends throughout the day, tracks your exercise automatically. I am certain this will be the best weightloss tool for me combined with cutting back calories.",5
611,"I've had this for almost a year now and it was working great to track my sleep,  i recently went to overnights,  and now the tracking is all over the place and won't track past 830, from the latest that i can see.  I got this solely for the sleep tracker,  if this continues I'm sadly going to have to stop the subscription.",4
612,I used this product for tracking my steps and sleeping habits,4
613,"I've been a long time fitbit user ever since it became available. Upgraded multiple times experienced all the different versions of fitbit. The body scan was what bought me into halo.I opened the box, charged the device, downloaded the app and updated the device.  No issues. Loved the onboarding experience. Wore the band.. surprise! No clock! No display! I didn't like it to begin with. I just got too excited about the body scan and didn't read anything else. But within a day, i started to love the fact that it's more than just a device that scans your sleep heart rates steps. halo ""grades"" my day and movement. It will do the math for you and give you more points or deduct for not moving enough. Very similar system that weight watcher uses. They don't make you to count the calories- they make you to count the points. Data and dashboard is easy to interpret, use, and simple. I loved the body scan feature. You don't need to be naked by the way. I also find the tone feature interesting. I haven't decided whether I want to turn my mic off yet as I find this info useful to see how stressful my day was. But I also see the cost- shorter battery life.The fabric band is so comfortable. I always hated how bulky or annoying the fitbit silicone band is. Halo fabric band feels just like a long sleeve t shirt. I love it.",5
614,"I loved the idea of how Halo could track the intensity of more ""every day"" types of exercise better than Fitbit - carrying lots of groceries, taking multiple steps at a time, etc. So when I received the invitation I purchased it right away. I already know what I'm doing when I work out - I was looking to see the impact of my more general activities. I've been using it for about two weeks now and I'm going to return it.I don't mind that there is no ""face"" to this tracker - it is a bit of an extra step to go into the app every time you want to check something, but it is a minor inconvenience overall. The band itself is small, comfortable, and unobtrusive. I prefer the look of it significantly over the look of my Fitbit Versa 2.Overall, this band made me feel worse about myself than anything else. Apparently I am always angry/disappointed/condescending, even if I'm telling my cats how cute they are. I never sleep well, and I'm way out of shape. Tone is wildly inaccurate, drains the battery, and the Body scan is invasive if nothing else. There was a significant (8%) difference between what my BF reading was from the Halo to a measurement I received elsewhere. Did I expect this? Yes. Was it worse than I'd hoped? Also yes. While this is motivating to a degree, it also kind of sucks. Combined with Tone, I apparently have no redeeming qualities (lol)It just isn't what I hoped it would be, and not nearly as accurate as it claims. Now that my Fitbit has updated its software, it seems to do more of that ""general"" tracking that isn't necessarily a workout. 2020 has been hard enough for most people without Amazon collecting this data and making you feel bad about yourself. Back to Amazon it goes!Sincerely,Flo aka The Penguin as Portrayed by Danny Devito (according to Halo)",2
615,"I have used fitness trackers from Jawbone, FitBit, and now Amazon. Halo is far and away the best value for your money and provides extremely deep functionality at a very competitive price point.The app is the most complete I have seen, bringing together activity, sleep, challenges/labs, voice inflection, and body fat tracking in a one-stop interface. Tying your activity score to heart rate & duration instead of just a simple step count gives better insight into your efforts to improve cardiovascular health.Tone is one of Halo's differentiating features, and it's powerful! I've found the voice profile is sometimes inaccurate, and I'll get tone snapshots for the video I'm watching or the person I'm talking with on speakerphone. However, the ""live"" mode is invaluable for instantly understanding how you're communicating in important conversations. While intended for personal conversations, the live tone tracking is also invaluable for virtual work meetings where it's difficult to 'read the room' and understand how your message is being received.The apps 'lab' feature gives you lifestyle modification challenges and guided workouts that would normally be part of a separate application & subscription cost.Halo is an outstanding value and is more than a simple fitness tracker. A deep application and novel set of features makes it one of the most complete wellness tools at its price point. It's a mistake to compare Halo to an iWatch; toe-to-toe against any fitness-focused product you won't find a better deal.",5
616,The app is a bit cumbersome. I have been wearing it along with my current fitbit. Halo may give better results on the actual steps/activity results.,3
617,I like the band size and it really does have alot of cool features.  Only thing I would like to see them add is gps tracking for runs . 🏃‍♀️,4
618,"I have been wearing this band daily since September. I wanted to like it and I do for some things.Pros:~I don’t feel the band. It’s very comfortable and not “sticky”.~I like the features and feel motivated to earn “points”~you can wear it in the shower~the price (but keep in mind there will be a monthly app fee)~no email, text  phone notifications-this was a plus for me (at first)...Cons:~monthly app fee after 6 months~starting to glitch a lot~no screen (I was happy about this at first, but I hate having to use my phone to check my heart rate while exercising)~body fat measuring and voice tone just seem a bit too “creepy” for me. You can turn off the voice tone feature if you want.~charging this thing is super frustrating at times.~no music feature~still feel connected to my phone~heart rate tracker is hit/miss~not a great choice if you workout a lot*I won’t be paying for the app after my 6 month trial, so the watch will be useless. I will be purchasing something that does have a screen, holds music, has gps, and is more reliable with tracking my heart rate.",3
619,"I have a popular name brand smart Watch, and those who also do, know it needs to be charged at night and can’t track your sleep, especially if you have been active during the day.  I ordered the Halo for the sleep tracking feature.  It did an OK, job.There were nights I KNOW I was awake, but the Halo never detected that.But the thing that made me the most upset was, after a year, Amazon decided to start charging $3.99 for the subscription to a card that wasn’t my primary card.  It was to an elderly friends card that I store to make purchases on for them.I was never asked if I wanted this - or especially if this was the card I wanted it to be charged to.Shame on you.",3
620,It's good product but it doesn't work very well for all activities like sleep and at home. I recommend it but if you need something professional don't use it.,4
621,"I don’t know what some people are talking about. Bulky? I have an Apple Watch too, and that is the bulkiest thing ever. This is light and I forget it’s even on me. I’m fine without a display although I bet in the future Amazon will offer one with a watch component. I’m glad it doesn’t remind me every 5 minutes to breathe or move. I’m glad it doesn’t ding every time I get an alert on my phone. That’s what my phone is for. Anyways, the sleep tracker is better than others I’ve tried and it’s very helpful. I can absolutely tell a difference in my day when I get a good nights sleep and has helped me adjust my sleep schedule and routines. The body fat percentage is so cool- and has motivated me to move more! The labs are fun and challenging. The tone feature is cool, but not super helpful for me, and it drains your battery fast, so I just leave it off. When it’s off, the battery lasts 3-4 days, it’s awesome. If you want, you can quickly turn it on and off with the button on the band, if you’re about to have a conversation that you’d like it to monitor.  (Maybe you want to know how you sound to your boss? Or your partner? Or kids?) It charges quickly, and the fabric band is easy to clean. I’m looking forward to future improvements because this little thing is great already!",5
622,"I like it, keeps really good track of what you are doing. I got it for my sleep, and it tells me I'm a horrible sleeper.The only thing I have issues with is the money after the 6 months. We'll see how that goes.",3
623,"Overall great activity tracker. Pretty accurate to the best of my knowledge, but the charger is spotty. Sometimes it charges really fast, sometimes it takes all day- slow charging and requires multiple adjusting to get it to charge. Not sure if it's user error or design flaw, but it should be made to avoid this either way. Kinda disappointed that an activity tracker that does well drops the ball on charging.",4
624,"The replacement Halo device was sent and there was an accompanying label that I was to print and bring with the box and with a label inside. My printer has run out of ink. It will cost me about $39 to get a new cartridge. I would like to have a scan code sent to me so that I could return the original purchase Halo, the charger, the replacement Halo, and the band. I am not satisfied with the product. I was not able to get the halo replacement to work despite charging it overnight and then resetting it according to instructions. I had my son do the same thing we could not get it to reset. It might be that the charger is not working although I have no idea why. I am done. I would like to return this item. I would like to return all of the pieces. Please send me a scan code so that I do not have to replace the ink on my printer which I very rarely use now. I will return everything and at this point you don't even have to return my $44. This is turned into a big hassle. I have always appreciated the graciousness of Amazon and will look forward to receiving that scan code via return email to my email address.  And, the label wants me to attach POSTAGE. Pay for the postage for the return. Come on... I have prime, I have 6 Alexa devices--I have bought several others as gifts, we spend a lot of money with Amazon.",1
625,I wish the time displayed but I see new options,4
626,"The Halo membership has great content and I used that content moderately. However, the app was slow to load the selections; the latency was significantly longer than my expectations based on other apps that provide content selection.After about six months the band consistently failed to record my sleep correctly. Since that was my main use for the band, it now sits in my junk tech box.After posting this review, I was contacted by a member of the Alexa team and he walked me through getting the band and app working again. I was surprised and quite happy with the outcome.I didn't give the product five stars because of some physical design issues, especially the charger but overall I think the product and the app are great.Not sure I want to drop $100 for a product that lasts six months.......",4
627,"The things it does are nice. I have not used the tone monitoring. It would be amazing if there was an accessory band that had time and other displays on it. It could piggy back of the same charger port and have a fabric covered screen like the Dot with clock.... I've got ideas. Amazon, call me.I really don't like the included strap.  The hook and loop sections make it hard to quickly pull the strap through the strap hoop because each little section will get caught unless you give it some finesse.  It is unnecessarily hard to do with one free hand.  And the accessory straps are kind of ridiculously priced.  People want Amazon devices because they work and aren't expensive.  This is skewing the perception the wrong way.The charger has little pins that you have to be careful of.  I found one of mine bent out of place and it wasn't charging.  I was able to get it back in line, but I am very wary of it now.  Chances are that bending it more than a couple times will break the pin off and render the charger useless.  Not ideal.",3
628,"I have had 3 fitbits over the years.  They are reliable and they give me the data I want quickly and easily.  Overall, this is the first swing and a miss I have had with an amazon label product.  They usually come out with solid practical technology.  I don't need an apple to get the job done.  But Halo missed the mark big time.It took getting used to not having a display to get information quickly. I am tired of having to open and app to access data.  I want the device to be quick and easy. Having to open the app, across through it, not quick although it is easy.In the first 3 weeks my Halo did not keep track of my sleep.  I don't care what anyone says, my 6 years of fitbit did not have more than 2 nights it did not keep my data. I verified I was wearing it correctly. After the first no track of sleep I even tightened the Halo tighter than was comfortable.  Still had 2 more nights of no data for sleep.Just do the simple things well and that is all I want.  If my Halo can't even keep track of sleep no time for whatever else it says it can do.  I threw it out. Wasted the $100 because I trusted Amazon to deliver on the simple things.  First time they did not come through. No company is perfect. I felt they pushed it out the door a bit too quickly.  But not sure if I can trust them in the future on this product.  I doubt it.  I work hard for my money and don't take kindly to companies not delivering on what they promise.  Just do what you say you will, and Halo did not.",2
629,"Cons: I’ve been through 5 different devices as they have broken literally every 30 days. Good news: Amazon replaced each for free (with a refurbished model). The exact same piece broke every time, which hopefully they recognize and fix at some point. Also, no HRVPros: pretty easy to use as far as the app and easy to find the metrics you are looking for. Picks up on when you are exercising and is really accurate. Comfortable and easy to wear. Body comp is pretty cool. Sleep metrics seem to be pretty accurate and definitely useful. Access to a lot of workouts, diets, mindfulness, etc. if you’re into that (I didn’t use much). Only $3.99/mo for access to all of this, after 6 months free access.Bottom line: I would recommend a different tracker only for the fact that this thing has broken on me 5 times (and it’s been 20 days, so I’m waiting for this new one to go in the next few days).",3
630,"Overall definitely not bad for a cheaper alternative to the whoop band or similar.It’s easy to use, the sleep tracking seems really accurate (vs Fitbit and similar which never seemed to be able to figure out when I was actually asleep).The body fat is a cool addition.Battery life is commendable, I can wear mine for almost a full week prior to needing a charge, and charging is quick.My big complaints (which aren’t all that big) are largely surrounding the activity tracker:- it does a great job detecting my heart rate, but doesn’t sync with apps so I have to add in the workout. If I forget to add it in, I get basically no “points.”- it would be nice if I could “expand” the HR graph to see times during my day more specifically. Maybe I’m just picky?Overall certainly not a purchase regret, but the features that *are* missing make me think about getting an Apple Watch instead.",4
631,"I'm pretty happy with this purchase. I had been wanting a fitbit for awhile but just wasn't thrilled with steps and HR then Amazon dropped Halo so I thought I'd give it a try. It's interesting to see the trends in sleep, voice, & fitness. So far it helps keep me on track meeting goals with steps and activities plus all the labs are good. I almost signed up for a membership from 1 or 2 of the companies before Halo but now I have access to way more and the monthly membership is minimal so it's definitely worth it.I've never owned another device like this so I don't have much to compare it to. My phone tracking activities is nowhere close to accurate but Halo seems very accurate with activities. I dont know how it tracks sleep quality but it seems to be pretty accurate when compared to how I feel when I wake up. The body fat % does seem off but it's still motivating and helpful to watch progress. And the voice analysis is a little creepy but funny, you can turn it off, analyze just a few seconds intermittently throughout the day or turn it up and do more. It does run the battery down more if you turn it up.Overall I'm happy with Halo and would recommend. It's light weight and I really don't even notice it most of the time.",5
632,"I bought this hoping it could replace my aging Fitbit, which is having battery problems. Unfortunately, it won't and I will buy another Fitbit at some point. I have been wearing it on one wrist and my Fitbit on the other and comparing the two, and the accuracy of the Fitbit is very much better.While the heart rate monitor seems pretty accurate, nothing else is. For example, this morning I walked slowly for about half an hour, and while the Fitbit registered over 2,000 steps, the Halo seemed to register under 400 - I can't say for sure how many as the app doesn't show numbers just a bar graph where you can estimate things from how high up the graph they are. My total steps so far today on my Fitbit are 3500, on the Halo 1500.The sleep function is useless as it's totally inaccurate. Every single day without fail either the start or end time are wrong and there is no way to edit it, so the conclusions it comes to are ridiculously wrong. Last night, it thought I was in bed while I was sitting reading, so started my sleep 90 minutes before I went to bed. The two times I got up (to make a drink, then an hour later to get ready for bed) were counted as sleep disturbances. So instead of being asleep for six hours and two sleep disturbances totalling maybe half an hour, it registered four disturbances of almost two hours. This could be fixed by allowing us to edit the start and end times as Fitbit does, but they have ignored my request for this. So the sleep function is effectively useless.Some things in the lab section are useful, but others are a complete waste of time (example, simply checking a box once a day). You can also only do each lab once, so when you do find a good one you can't repeat it.I have tried several times to use the body fat function but I can't get it to work. I spend ages getting the phone in the right position with enough light, etc then it gives me a big check mark and freezes. Every time the app is updated I try again, hoping it's been fixed but it always freezes (I note it works for other people).Anyway, the app is free for six months, but I will be cancelling after that. I cannot recommend this at all, sadly.",1
633,Very good but stopped charging after after 18 months.,4
634,"I use this app mostly for sleep tracking. I've been able to see improvement over time in my REM sleep. I've been trying to increase REM for a long time and while the Halo has not been the cure, it has been an indicator of what helps and what doesn't - which is a pretty big deal.I haven't updated my body scan in a month and a half because I gained 10 pounds from a medication and I just don't wanna face that reality right now. It looks super accurate, though, and the data is consistent with smart scales.It is comfortable and the charge lasts a long time unless you're using Tone, which I haven't used a lot yet.I'm very happy with it. I prefer it over my smart watch because it is so minimal and non-intrusive.I think I will get a lot more benefit out of some of the Labs over time. The fitness Labs look great but I am not in a hurry to try one as I am easing myself into exercise in other ways currently. I like the Sleep Labs and meditation-oriented options a lot.The only thing I would like to see added is the incorporation of snoring detection and monitoring. I feel like it is possible considering there is a microphone and other sleep tracking features and it would be extremely useful for a lot of users.",5
635,"TLDR; The halo tracker while innovative, is absent key features such as weight tracking and food logging.I have tried a number of fitness trackers over the years, ranging from Jawbone & Fitbit bands, to non-generic bands such as Letscom, YayMay, and Burxoe.  The aforementioned bands consistently fail in critical areas, such as heart rate tracking and calorie estimation.The Halo band is excellent however at accurate reporting of heart rate and calorie expenditure.  The process to actually find and review daily calorie expenditure is quite complicated however, and requires opening three different parts of the app to find it.The Halo app does not have any means through which to log or track weight, outside of the initial profile setup where you enter your ""Starting"" weight.  The BMI scans seemed inaccurate and gimmicky during my attempt to set up the feature, which I abandoned after the third failed attempt due a bug within the apps handling of my camera.The app also does not offer any option to log or keep track of foods eaten throughout the day, nor any way to review micro-nutrients such as sodium, fat, or carbohydrate percentages.  There are also currently no options to link with third-party fool logging services, such as Fat Secret or My Fitness Pal.The fabric band is a great design feature however, as it does not trap water or moisture which neoprene and rubber bands are notorious for.  It is also easily cleaned, and can be worn for longer periods of time without risk of rash or skin irritation.If Amazon figures a way to upgrade the app with features for weight tracking and food logging, I may consider using the device again; possibly even with the paid subscription they push as a requirement within the initial device setup.",2
636,"I originally bought this to try out to help me track and understand my sleep habits in order to make necessary changes. While it definitely tracked data of some sort - I wore it alongside a Garmin watch of roughly the same value.  Of course the apps showed different results and very different numbers.  The Halo basically indicated that I didn't sleep - ever while the Garmin showed my sleep cycles and the oxygen levels while I was sleeping.In addition to the sleep, I was trying to track my heart rate as I was starting to struggle with irregular heartbeat.  I was provided with an event monitor by my cardiologist, using the Halo and the Garmin.  The event monitor on my chest (the most accurate) was showing my resting heart rate closest to the Garmin.  The Halo would at times show a very high number or so low I should have been dead.  The Garmin was very steady.As far as the apps available.  Obviously the Halo is very new and have no capabilities to link up to huge platforms like Virgin Pulse or various competitive apps.  Which I knew going in to it.  The Garmin, links to most everything.  Although I'm not sure it's a fair comparison as one has been around much longer than the other.I did like the charging device and battery life more on the Halo.... but it didn't measure oxygen, so didn't have a constant light flashing to take readings for oxygen.Overall, is a good device is you aren't used to having one... or don't really care for a lot of capabilities.  But I am glad I got the trial release because I'm not sure I would have been happy about spending $99 on it PLUS the various required subscriptions to go with it.Hope that helps?",2
637,"I thought I would love this thing but I wear an Apple watch daily - so this I wore on the other wrist.  Really, the only function it has that the Apple watch doesn't is the Tone App - it was funny to see what tones I used regularly with people...but the novelty wore off.  The body fat indicator was interesting, but quite frankly, that whole feature can be done with just the app - doesn't require wearing the Halo at all - unless you have no other device to track your fitness.  I also thought it was uncomfortable to wear - as some other users mentioned, you have to wear it really tight or it slips and hits your wrist bone - I actually had a bruise after the first week of wearing it.  The rubber sport band, which unfortunately I had to buy separately, helped a bit with that, but those bands should be an option with purchase.  Overall, the Halo now sits in a drawer and it's $70 down the toilet.  I would NEVER pay for a subscription for this thing!  I would only recommend it you wear no other device, like Apple watch or Fitbit.",3
638,"I have Oura ring and wanted compare my sleep. The Oura is much more accurate. Oura tracks nap, spO2, activities, and the halo is good for overall health tracker at cheap price.",3
639,"The only differential with the Halo than say a fitbit is the tone monitoring - which requires you charge it daily and after one day of curious tone monitoring, is just a novelty. Do we really not instinctively know what we sound like?  The other difference is the body composition monitoring - which meh - how often are you using that? The app is fine and filled with lots of common information, but how many times do you need to read it? The practical difference between the Halo and the fitbit is that Halo has no watch element to it and you have to open the app to see any information - the band tells you nothing. I miss being able to tap for the time or date or tap to see my steps or heartrate. If you don't like or need the watch aspect, the price of the device is essentially the same across brands so it comes down to whether and extra $4 a month is worth the tone and body composition monitoring. Meh, if I never  had another fitness band, this would have been great, but in comparison, not so much. The accuracy of sleep, steps and heartrate is the same as Fitbit.",3
640,"Pro - slim design with no screen is less distracting as I dont care about a watch feature etc. Sleep tracker is very good and interesting to see how you dip between the different sleep cycles. It seems pretty accurate too. The app is user friendly and I have had no issues with charging or syncing like I noted some others do. I dont use Tone feature and wont as it doesnt interest me.  The body scan worked fine and provided clear verbal instructions on how you need to stand and how the phone should be angled.Cons - it picks up activity automatically which is helpful but I wish there was a way to confirm 'right, I am starting my jog now' as it doesnt always immediately pick up the correct start and end time. Also, if you exercised for an hour and switch between walking and running it will create two (ore more) activities. You can add an activity and manually set it for the time you exercised but this is kind of annoying.  It also doesn't seem to track distance, just steps.  This feature needs to be enhanced if it is to match the capabilities of other fitness trackers.",3
641,"I wear my band 24/7 unless charging. The battery life is great. I do not use voice recognition, however, because that feature takes drains battery faster.I look at my sleep score daily and look at my weight, bmi, and body fat percentage regularly. I also like how there is now a measure for waist to hip ratio.I love the photo scan technology. Looking back at my progress over time is so helpful and motivating to me. My progress has been slow and steady over time, but I have made big progress overall. I appreciate being able to “see it” stored in this format - with both the photos and the data.",5
642,"I don't like watches and was hoping to find something to help track my sleep and physical activity without a bulky watch on my wrist.  At the price point I was unsure of this band, but I should have known better.  As with most smart watches this band does not update unless connected to the internet, which is not a problem.  The problem is that for days on end it refuses to connect, stating it cannot sync right now and basically to try again later.  Unsure if it's the hardware or app, but either way it is frustrating and doesn't work consistently at all.  Sleep tracker seems fairly accurate, but the lack of consistent updates is a deal breaker for me.",2
643,"I am very pleased with the Amazon Halo. It is built with a nice, low profile design. The band is very comfortable and I can hardly tell I am wearing it. Heart rate readings appear to be very accurate compared to my Garmin watch. I have notice step counts being a little higher than my other devices measure but not a significant difference. The app provides good information for sleep and activities as well as providing a good resting heart rate measurement. A couple of improvements I have sent in include adding additional activities to the list (like Pickleball) and improving the graphs on the app to make them interactive so that you can touch the screen and see heart rate at any point in time - currently they are not interactive and only provide the High measurement. Allowing a click on the graphs to make them larger and interactive (like the Garmin app) gives better detail to see your performance at any point in an activity or throughout the day. The Body Scan feature seems pretty solid. I have not used the Voice Tone feature. I have not decided if I will pay for the subscription once the free period is over - seems pretty expensive for the amount of features I might use. Overall, very pleased with the device and the app and hoping Amazon continues to invest in improving a solid app.",5
644,"The sleep tracking is probably my favorite feature. It’s nice to have data to refer to night to night to compare and make adjustments to improve my sleep health. The tone isn’t as accurate unless you have the microphone on for your entire waking period but, if you do, you have to charge the band almost daily. I have a medium band and it fits great. The adjustability and durability of the velcro are excellent. I’ve worn it in the shower, pool, and ocean with no issues. I’d love to see a small digital clock added. I know the purpose of this product is not for time-tracking but, it would be a nice feature since it is worn on your wrist where a watch might be. Otherwise, I am very happy with it and would highly recommend it!",4
645,"I love, love, love this device. I use the sleep tracker religiously every night (it tracks automatically), and have been amazed by the detail provided. It tracks sleep efficiency based on hours asleep, time to fall asleep, duration & % in each sleep stage. The app even provides a graph of your sleep stages, which also shows disruptions in your sleep. I use the love heart monitor while on the treadmill and love that it not only tracks my steps, but provides an estimate of my daily calorie needs based on my level of activity for the day. It also breaks down how long you were sedentary versus light/moderate/intense activity. One thing that I absolutely LOVE about the app that comes with the band are the ""labs."" Each week I can participate in a sleep lap that has various sleep enhancing audio tracks (e.g., nature sounds, bedtime story, relaxing music). There are other types of labs, too, such as exercise routines (e.g., yoga, hiit, cardio, strength) and others. The battery life is great. I don't use the ""live"" tracking often (it supposedly uses battery at a faster rate), so I only need to charge about once a week. I got the sports band, which I find so comfortable I forget I'm wearing the band. To be fair, the band it comes with is also comfy, but I only used it 1 day and cannot speak to long term comfort. I am ecstatic about this purchase.",5
646,I was excited to receive my Halo Band it arrived quickly. I was very interested in the tone feature. I followed the setup directions to the letter before using it. The app and band setup was easy enough. The first night I used the band it tracked my sleep ok. That was about all it did. The other features gave inaccurate data. The tone tracking never worked properly if at all. When I took the band off I had to uninstall and reinstall it every time. It was time consuming and annoying. On the third day none of the features would work. I contacted customer service had a ticket open but no one ever got back to me. I reached out again and because no one helped me they sent me a new one. It took awhile for the replacement to arrive. Set up again was easy. I did not have the same issue with connecting it after I took it off but the band would always say off wrist mic paused even when I was wearing it which was frustrating because the tone feature is the main reason I bought the band. It tracked my sleep one night but not after that. I adjusted the band several different ways but still did not work. The tone never worked unless I manually recorded it. The heart rate would not read said I needed to be wearing the band which I was. The activity tracking was inaccurate. I thought the first band was defective  but when the second one arrived and had most of the same problems I was extremely disappointed. Every interaction with customer service over these issues was always the same they told me what the users manual and troubleshooting articles said. I can read so that was useless and a huge waste of time. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. Even though the app was fine after my six month trial was done I’d have to pay every month to use it. Not worth the money or time there are many other options out there that cost the same or less that actually do what they claim to do.,1
647,"Update - Amazon has contacted me more than once about trying to help me solve my issues. It is clear they care about this product launch. I think that the functionality issues I've experienced on the sleep tracker, etc. could be fixed with updates, but the constant struggle to get the charging cradle to work is an unsalvageable flaw.  I struggled for about 10 minutes today and I still can't get it to charge. I gave up out of frustration and am sadly returning the Halo. Hopefully there will be a charger redesign. If there were one ready to go, I would keep the product - even if there was an aftermarket solution. However, as it stands, the voice analysis function forces you to charge on a daily basis, and I can't fidget with the thing every day because the charging prongs won't align due to the poor charging cradle design. I'm disappointed that it's something as basic as the charger that makes this a hard fail - and for the final retail price I just saw (mine was discounted), not only should the charger work, but it should come with a wall prong IMHO.Original review - The charger is so poorly designed that it becomes a struggle to use because the tracker never sits just right. I feel like I spend more time trying to adjust the charger than wearing the device. Charging, as a result, is hit or miss, and has become so frustrating that I will likely return the product.  Sleep tracking is also intermittent in terms of proper functionality. Several times the product can only supply what it calls partial results. I keep getting told by customer service to reset the device. Maybe Amazon needs to reset the design? I really wanted to love this thing. Unfortunately it is not ready for prime time. Maybe the next generation will have more care dedicated to it.",2
648,Sleep tracking pretty accurate,4
649,"Very happy with the band. I liked that it did not have a screen, I like the watch I have.  Very happy with the sleep information and the activity tracker. I LOVE that I don't have to set anything up when I decide to go on a walk or hike. The voice analyzer truly eats up battery power. It is a neat feature, but I had to turn off after a week because I felt like I was charging all the time. I also love the programs/classes they have, used the sleep and meditation ones and want to try yoga.  I had no problems with the charger until today. Got the band in mid November 2020 and today the charger does not work. Sort of pissed I have to purchase another one after about 4 months. Still going to stick with it. We shall see, maybe I got dud.",4
650,"I have never own a Fitbit or any other tracker besides the pedometer on the iPhone. When I read up on the Halo I knew it was the tracker for me!! Such a sleek look! I didn’t want a screen or a watch and most of the time I forget I’m wearing it! I only take it off when I shower- not because I have to ( I hate the feel of wet wristband) so that’s when I charge it! I haven’t used the voice tone check yet, but I go DAYS without charging it! So nice!I always thought 10,000 steps was unattainable. My phone would say I would walk 1,000 and I would be so shocked. After I got the Halo I realized the difference between what my phone tracks (I leave it places when I clean etc) and what I’m capable of doing! The first day I hit 10,000 I almost cried. I was so happy!I’ve always been self conscious of my weight and size so the biggest selling point for the Halo was the body fat scan! It gives me motivation while also giving me and idea where I was at prior.The way the points system is set up gets me SO MOTIVATED. I’ve been more active since getting the Halo then I have been in years!I would highly suggest the Halo to anyone!",5
651,"After 3 days, the battery started dying. I charged it overnight the 3rd day from 10pm to 6am, it was at 100%, then at 9am it was down to 5%. The next day, same. Also, Tone stopped working the 2nd day. Even when I pressed the button, it lit up blue to show Tone activated but it simply didn't pick up or didn't recognize my voice, and registered no Tone. The Steps feature is off. It was logging me at 12,000 for an average day on my nondominant hand. My phone was logging me at like 6,000 or 7,000. The new update added a Movement feature, which it was cool to get evaluated for Stability and see the 3D model of my own body, but by then the battery was dying. I like the screenless, no vibration concept bc I feel other products are super distracting. I like the idea of Tone and Movement and Stability. But this was clearly pushed to market way too soon, probably took 5 weeks to create the entire product. Amazon has a long way to go if they're trying to get into the fitness tracker business. If they can work out the kinks and deliver what they promise, then I'll try it again in a year or two. But for now, I asked for a full refund and I'll be getting a different brand. The little startup video at the beginning setup was really cool, I like the marketing for this product. I just wish it worked the way it's supposed to. Note, my husband got one as well, in black, same issues.",2
652,"I was able to try the watch early. I was excited about the “voice tone” feature. (Since you can get step, sleep, and HR on an fitness watch)It was very inaccurate. It made me “sad” or “scared” the most every day. One day I was “irritated”when I at a Christmas parade?? I was yelling merry Christmas and laughing with pure joy. (Probably the happiest I had been in year 2020) I could learn to work around it if you didn’t have to charge it every day because using voice tone runs down the battery. And like many more have mentioned it charges VERY POORLY. I once left it on for a full day(24 hours) and only got to 67% charge and obviously did not use it all day, in the process, it subtracted fitness points for the week.The sleep tracker is wildly inaccurate. Just last night I laid down to sleep at 10:15. I tossed and turned until 12:00 midnight when I sat up to see time on my phone. I laid back down and then finally fell asleep. Halo said it took 5 minutes to fall asleep when the reality it was two hours. Also I have been up to use the bathroom before and still got a good night sleep review. It’s just odd.I cannot comment on the body scan. Which I was very very excited about because if I wanted to use the “voice tone” part I kept having to take it off and charge it. I never kept it long enough to even try that part.I also agree with others, it’s not real comfortable, minor stuff, but yet just one more negative.  The price was great, and I do believe Amazon will make this a great product, but right now it sucks. If it improves (a lot) I will reconsider purchasing again. But for now, it’s getting returned.",2
653,"The longevity of this fitness tracker is not long. First it stopped charging and when I got it charged it would not sync with the app. The battery would last less than a day without using the voice recognition. I really didn't find the membership content to be that useful and stopped getting it after my free subscription ended.Save your money and buy a quality tracker from Garmin, Fitbit, Apple Watch, or higher end products. You will not be disappointed. I ended up going back to using a Fitbit since the Amazon Halo died in less than 2 years.",2
654,"I bought the Halo band thinking that its features were really cool. I hadn't seen any other wearable gear that had tone of voice data collection, and I got the band out of curiosity.At first I was surprised with how comfortable the band was, even for sleeping. Normally I can't stand wearing a watch to bed, but this one was discrete enough that it seldom was ever bothersome. I found the sleep measurement feature very accurate and is probably my favorite feature.Despite these two cool features, I simply couldn't find a need to wear the band at all times. I was disappointed with the lack of a clock on the face of the band. I feel like they could've just imbedded some low powered LEDs to give it one without compromising battery. I ended up returning it because I simply felt like I didn't need it. But for someone who is looking for a step-counter and sleep-tracker, this works well!",4
655,"Either the charger or the band broke after about 8 months of use. Charging worked periodically, and I was able to use the band sometimes (with months in-between use). Wasn't worth rebuying a charger or getting a new one with the warranty because the product honestly was not that good.",2
656,I’ve been wearing a fitbit on my ankle during my workouts for a few weeks now.  Halo is the same size and feel as the Fitbit trackers.  It does track your sleep very well but so does Fitbit. The voice tone is just weird. I don’t care how I come across to others.  Either you like me or you don’t…so there 😝. What halo is super bad at is tracking your steps.  Gee the one thing a tracker should be good at this actually falls short.  It fails to track your steps.  Doesn’t even come close.  First day I wore the halo on my wrist and Fitbit on my ankle.  Fitbit just rolled as it’s suppose to and halo stopped counting.  AND you can’t manually adjust it either!!! I was so excited about halo…let down again. Come’on Amazon!  Get your acts together.  Better luck next timeJust an update…I sent back the Halo.  I’m sticking with Fitbit.  Sorry amazon,3
657,"It disconnects from phone often, and it's very difficult to paired each time.",3
658,"The sleep tracking isn't that great; there have been times I'm awake and it thinks I'm sleeping, so some dysfunction on where it starts measuring sleep. I also really dislike it doesn't actually function as a watch. I think most people's instinct is to feel a watch on their wrist and expect to see the time but I guess Amazon felt differently. I also workout maybe 5 or 6 times a week so the band gets really dirty really quickly so that's not great. The voice tone analyzer also really sucks. Most days it doesn't measure much even if I stay talking on the phone or am stuck in meetings where I have to talk, there's hardly any data collection. I also don't like how it's not compatible with other smart workout devices (i.e. smart scales) like other workout watches but it's still new so hopefully it will in the future. The body composition is awesome. I really like how the 3D model stores and compares body fat composition over time and is pretty spot on. For the early access price, the watch is pretty good but at regular price, the only thing that stands out about it is the body fat composition measurements.",3
659,"I enjoy the amazon halo. The band itself is not distracting, the accompanying app has many labs to try out and is very user friendly. I did have an irritation that occurred when the sensor was wet against my skin but have not had any issues outside of that. I remove the band any time I’m in the shower or in water more than washing my hands. I think this product is best suited to better health interested individuals than super athletes. I charge my band in the car, it charges quickly and simply just rock it in the clip till the red indicator light illuminates and go. It’s a beautiful self accountability/motivational tool if that’s interesting to you I encourage you to try it out!P.S. I would also love to see some connectivity with Peloton/Apple.The tone data is interesting more so for the potential link to emotional health? I’d love to see this tool grow over time!",4
660,"I primarily bought this to track my sleep, and of the various inexpensive sleep trackers, it is probably one of the better ones in combination with its app.  That said, what it really needs is a start button when you are in bed to go to sleep.  The reason that this is important for people with insomnia is because your doctors want to know how long it takes you to fall asleep.  Since there is no start button, the app constantly tells me that it took somewhere between three minutes and nine minutes for me to fall asleep.  If that were only true, my life would be wonderful!  The truth is that normally it takes me between 30 minutes and two hours to fall asleep.  Sometimes much longer than that.  Without a start button to let the WATCH know that I am attempting to sleep, it cannot take this into consideration when calculating its sleep score.It would also be nice if this band tracked your heart rate variability and gave you a report for that very important metric.",3
661,I love my Halo. The only thing I don't use is the voice tracker because it murders your battery. When I use the voice tracker I have to charge it every day when I don't use the voice tracker I charge it every two to three days. The fitness aspect of it is amazing. I really like that it tracks everything not just your steps. And the goals keep me pushing to get a higher number every week. The sleep tracker really helps me I didn't know how much I needed it. I like that it doesn't have a clock or face watch to it but if this is something that  you think you would like to have get something else. I like how discrete and small this is.The only ding for me is the battery with the voice tracker.,4
662,"Before using for water aerobics, I checked to make sure the band could get wet (I do not even shower with it on).  Finding this, I was reassured:Halo Band has a water resistance up to 50m. This means that it may be used for shallow water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean and can be worn in the shower.I wore 3 times in the pool, for approximately 1 hour each session. The plate came off and the seal broke, which then water leaked in and rendered the band useless.Bummed as I liked a lot otherwise.  I will try one more time (for $100), and now will NOT use in water, but if it does not last for a year, likely not worth buying again.",4
663,"I've been very disappointed with this device, on the whole.  Likes:  A  strength is tracking daily activity, sorted into degrees of intensity or sloth.  Like other trackers, it counts steps taken daily.  The body-scan feature is useful, as is the heart rate monitor, which seems pretty accurate.Dislikes:  The wrist band is too tight, making it hard to put on and take off, which is a nuisance given that the device needs to be recharged more or less daily.  I have found the vocal ""tone"" feature to be of little value, as its classifications  seem arbitrary and of doubtful usefulness.  The activity ""labs"" offer some good information for workouts, but I've found it difficult to put into use, as the typeface is so tiny than I cannot read it while exercising, and it sometimes involves exercise devices (e.g., a barre) that I don't have.My main complaint, though, is the sleep tracker.  It was the thing I was most interested in, since my sleep habits are erratic.  I often have trouble falling asleep or wake up too early and can't get back  to sleep for a while.  The Halo sleep tracker is not helpful here, as its ""data"" are undependable, to put it mildly.  It rarely tracks my entire sleep cycle through the whole night. For example, if I retire around midnight and fall asleep within 30 minutes, the tracker often does not record anything until 4:00 or 5:00 a.m.  If my sleep is interrupted by a brief trip to the bathroom, the device doesn't record that interruption consistently either.  Sometimes it appears as an extended period of wakefulness (whether or not I was able to fall asleep), and sometimes not.  In either case, the info. is virtually useless.  This has been a major disappointment for me!",2
664,"Overall, this gets the job done with some cool features and good battery life, but it's too much of a closed system. Needs AT LEAST integration into Apple/ Google Fitness.",3
665,"Its been about 4 months of using the Halo device and it's been mostly really, really pleasant. Main points of emphasis below. I bought the device as I was undertaking a weight losing challenge, definitely helped.- This is not an Apple Watch or Fitbit. If you want less distraction but still want to track your activity, this is much better. I didn't want the crazy notifications or look at texts on my device, just sleeping and activity tracking.- Love the heart rate tracking - after pretty much every single exercise, I map out what it was and how my heart rate changed. Addicted to challenging workouts.- Sleeping is SUPER interesting. Every morning, I will check and whether it's placebo or not - if I've slept well, I know I'll have a better day.- Body scanning - admit this could be better.. I'm relatively slim and the BMI seems to be off (saying I'm obese). Use as a progress mechanism, but don't beat yourself up about the fat %s. But, super cool to see your 3d images.- No API to other apps :( - Please Amazon, fix this. If this device worked w/ Map My Fitness for food tracking, I would love it more.- Never use the tone feature, but I'm sure it's cool.",5
666,"Have been using Halo for about 4 or 5 months.  It does exactly what it says it does.  Read the reviews of people complaining about it not having a face.  Why did you order it then if you knew it didn't have a face?  It tracks exercise points accurately.  I like that it counts calories on a daily basis from midnight to midnight. Not sure how accurate the calorie counter is but probably more accurate than the running app on my phone while sitting in my pocket.  The sleep feature is interesting. I did not know I went into REM sleep so often and I regularly use the 'isochronic' sound to go fast asleep.  I shower with it and have left it on for about 6 days before charging.  Make sure the sensor is clean and clear of soap residue.  I have not used any other fitness tracker.  Halo Customer service and response to issues is dependable and they always answer questions or address complaints with apparent solutions, at least that is my experience.  They also recently extended my free trial by several months.  I don't use most of the workout programs as I am set in my ways to do what I do when I run.  I don't need coaching or motivation.",5
667,"I have been tremendously happy with my Halo fitness band and the related app. My wife uses an Apple Watch for fitness tracking and it seems very obtrusive to me. The Halo band does its job in the background and when I want to deal with fitness issues I go to the app to get the information that I need. I do not use the ""tone"" function and as a result the battery life is great. I can go days before having to recharge. The sleep monitoring function has proven very helpful to me and has made me aware of some issues in my sleep pattern. With that information I have started to change some of my sleep habits with very good initial results. I have done the body scan a few times and the results are very consistent and within my expectations. I do a scan every two weeks and that is sufficient. Lastly, and most importantly, the activity tracking is very valuable. I am far from a ""fitness nut"" and just want to make sure that I am getting a reasonable amount of exercise every week. The heart rate monitoring does a great job in the fitness tracking process.In conclusion, I strongly recommend the Halo for fitness, sleep and body scanning. It is there when you want to assess your level of activity and gives you the information you need to monitor your fitness.",5
668,Is good,4
669,"Terrible app with limited capabilities. My amazafit offers far more detail and information than this device, I only purchased because I wanted a fitness tracker without a screen so I can wear a watch. This device is very pedestrian in regards to health and fitness trackers strongly considering returning after a week of use.",3
670,"I really like this device, but unfortunately mine broke after only about 10 months of use (the sensor covering detached from the back). I think it was a fluke though, because my husband got a Halo at the same time I did and his is still going strong with no signs of breaking. Amazon sent me a replacement because it was still under one year warranty, which is nice. I'm hoping this one isn't defective, because I really do like the Halo.",4
671,"I bought the Halo Band and was loving it.  I got notice from the company that the Band was not working properly (I did not notice anything amiss) and that I would receive an immediate replacement.  True to the notice, I received a new Band and a link to return the old one free.  I love the information I receive on sleep, activity, tone and access to workouts.  I also love the “low key” look; great with bracelets and allows me to wear a proper watch.  Highly recommend.",5
672,"What stood out to me:  ●It says made for iPhone but works just fine  with my galaxy. (+)  ●I libe the minimalistic design. Also my skin does not get irritated from this band like it usually does all my apple watch bands, originL and 3rd party in multiple materials. (+)  ●they almost got the body scanner right. For some reason it keeps adding a pudge pocket that I clearly don't have. I love my muffin tops for breakfast and don't appreciate the illusion that I had a pair.(-) The rest of how the body scanner works is pretty interesting. I like the science/idea behind it much better than the apple watch. (+)  ●I noticed that the monitor doesn't have an extended history of data collected and stored compared to the apple watch(-),  fitbit, Samsung gear, but know they were trying to make it as HIPAA compliant as possible. (+)",4
673,"So far I like it. Its comfortable and fits me well. Despite an earlier claim, the charger clip is NOT hard to use at all.My issue with the product is the app itself. I spent a good hour trying to get the body recognition to work. I still haven't gotten it to work yet. The voice recognition is cool, but each time I log in to the app, it says the mic is off because my band is off my wrist. Also, it apparently doesn't track naps. Which makes me wonder how it tracks sleeping at night vs napping. My sleep schedule is completely off due to my work schedule. I don't get home until 4am. So if it tracks according to time, how will my reading ever be accurate?I really hope these minor things are fixed. I really do like it. But kind of bummed these features are giving me such a hard time.",4
674,"I really wanted to love this. But from the start it has been a disappointment. First off the voice analyzer uses so much battery life i have not used it since day 1.Accuracy of sleep is questionable. Sometimes it will not even recognize a night of sleep. Other times it shows i was asleep when i was awake.It doesnt track naps. I work a rotating shift which has me work nights sometimes. I may go home and take a 2-3 hr nap and it is just sedintary time. The new update addressed the night shift sleepers. But not naps.The system that tracks activity intensity also is flawed. Sometimes ill get a random few minutes of intense activity sitting on my couch, or driving to work.Another bad thing is the charging device. Seems very archaic and is clumsy. I have to toy with it to find the perfect spot for it to charge.The body fat scan seems accurate and is a cool feature, the labs are good too. It is small and easy to wear. But the inaccuracy of this is to much of a let down. I hope these things are fixed with updates.",3
675,"After searching for the right fitness tracker, Amazon recommended this product to me - Halo. What I like about it is that there are no distractions on my wrist. I really appreciate the sleep tracking and sleep sessions available through the app. It does a good job of tracking activity. But, I wish very much that I could easily set activity goals. And, sometimes it is annoying to wear something on my wrist at all times, especially during sleep. I'll keep using this for at least the 6 month introductory period on the app, then I may consider a replacement of some kind.",4
676,"Overall a fan, I like the points system (even if it makes me sad that downhill hiking on a 15% grade is low impact - tell that to my knees!!! But I get it.), and no screen is nice. One main issue I’ve had is that for some reason long car rides make it freak out. We drove 12 hours one way and I wasn’t even wearing it but it said I did like 6 hours of intense activity and that my pulse was 220 the whole time. Something they will need to fix as even when I tried to Delete the erroneous activity logs the points still stayed for the week, which was a bummer as it messed up the accurate value.I don’t use the tone (useless feature) or the BMI because while I know my Alexa is spying of me I draw the line at sending Amazon photos of me in my skivvies.",4
677,"The sleep tracking app was hit or miss. I’d had the Halo for over a week before it recorded my first nights sleep. When it did record my sleep, it said I was getting about an hour to two hours sleep every time it recorded. I think it does record movement fairly accurately and that piece does seem fine, but it probably isn’t enough for me to keep it long term. Once it started recording sleep, it still didn’t show up every night and it increases the battery usage tremendously. Also, because of the amount of time it’s on your wrist, it tends to develop a smell under and around the device. I never enabled the voice monitor because that would have decreased battery usage even faster. I did try the body fat portion but taking the picture is very cumbersome. Overall, IMO it still needs a bit of work. Giving credit where credit is due, it DID get me moving a bit more. I think it’s lack of integration with 3rd party apps is another limitation. I’d like to see some integration with a diet/calorie monitoring app and perhaps a bit more use from the only input piece, the button.",3
678,"I really like this little fitness tracker. I really like the body scan even though it told me things I didn't want to know. I liked it it was unobtrusive on my wrist. I liked that it didn't buzz or answer the phone or take text messages. I liked the labs that the app offered. All in all I just liked it.I think the thing I liked the most was that it recognized when I was just wandering around and when I was running, raking, etc.I only used the tone for a week. It sucks up battery life and seriously ... I only talk to myself or my dog so ...The battery life is impressive.The sleep tracker is pretty good.I've been swimming everyday for over a month with no issues.If you're looking for something that functions as a phone on your wrist, this is not it. But if you're looking for something that will help track your sleep will help track your movement and help you set goals without obsessively counting steps, then this is it for you.You'll have to download the app so please make sure that it works with your phone. I didn't have any trouble setting it up, I didn't have any trouble connecting it, I didn't have any trouble.",5
679,"I bought halo band to replace my Samsung watch since Samsung has decided to do away with their Health App.  The Halo is small and you can sometimes forget you are wearing it, which is great when sleeping.  However I found it only tracks my sleep about 75% of the time.  I have woken up many times to find the Halo did not record any sleep.  When it does track your sleep it seems to be fine. I do not like the way that it does not track naps. For recording steps I found a big flaw.  If you go in a grocery store and are pushing a cart, the Halo does not track those steps.  It seems to only track when the arm you have it on is moving. In fairness I have not tried it during serious workouts, though I am skeptical since it doesn't handle the minor things well.  I would not get this again.",2
680,Voice recognition doesn't pick up my voice 90% of the time. The more features you have ON the faster it drains your battery. Hard to take advantage of the features when you constantly have to charge or keep an eye on the battery life.,4
681,"I received my halo yesterday.  Everything but 'body' is set up.  I DID have trouble with the voice at first even though halo said the microphone was on and she checked everything as I read but THEN after all were checked told me to try again because it didn't take (she said she didn't 'hear' me).  Today I took my band off and held the backside it to my mouth and read the phrases again and THIS time everything worked.  I'm now getting my moods with what appears to be accuracy !Steps during exercise were also accurate along with the rest that I take during the day as was sleep.  I also have an Inspire watch that measures sleep as well but apparently thinks I sleep better than I do and halo recorded 10 points less which I believe is far more accurate since I thrashed a LOT last night.So far I am VERY pleased!  I'm 73 and while I might do the 'body' image part at some point I really don't see that anything would change over time so far as BMI, weight etc. so I'll wait for that.  I do exercise every day and have a set routine but I believe I basically just remain the same month to month (unless I'm ill).",5
682,"I  bought this band specifically to help me track my sleep. Since December 11th, I have worn it nonstop. Out of all of the days, I only have one day of missing data. I don't know the reason for that error. I like the fact that I can go into the app and share my sleep(less) pattern to my doctor to support that I in fact do have insomnia.I have used the photo scan feature, and I absolutely love this idea. I don't scan regularly, but I can actually see a difference in my stomach, and while I haven't gained weight, my stomach has gotten fatter. In other words, I know what has cause the fat to increase and slimness to decrease (cake). I didn't realize that me eating healthy six days out the week and eating cake on the seventh day would affect my body in such a way. I'm glad for this feature, as it helped me to see.In all, I just use it for tracking purposes. So much more exists within the app that I may try at some point. For example, in the Discover tab, I am quite interested in relieving stress and heightening my mood. The Discover tab has many programs to help with all of the tracking features. Lastly, the charge time is freakishly fast!",5
683,"Hilarious to hear all of these users complain about the activity tracking and how it demotivates them. I guess learning how sedentary you are can be a hard pill to swallow but it isn’t the devices fault. I’m very active and get around 900 activity points a week. If it is Sunday and I’m at 859 I’m feeling motivated to do a few exercises and get me up to my 900. The decide takes some getting used to especially for someone who doesn’t currently wear a fitness band. The sleep fund toon works but not as well as Fitbit in regard to disturbances, time you fell asleep, etc. body scan is fun to get to see but hasn’t really driven my fitness or experience as of yet. My biggest gripe is the battery life. Spending two hours a day without your device on your wrist in order to charge it fully is just too much.",4
684,"I bought it because I like trying new things, especially from Amazon. The only nice thing: body scans and seeing what you’d look like if slimmer.What is not good:- band is poorly designed. A medium seems to be the right size for me but unlike on the Apple Watch, where the Velcro band has the loop (the hole where the band slides through) practically on the watch case, this one has a bit over an inch of strap between the loop and the watch body. This makes it so that the maximum diameter of the band is much smaller, which makes it much harder to get the watch on.- battery only lasts one day pretty much- charger doesn’t make contact with watch easily. I sometimes have to remove it and put it back on the charger for it to start recharging- syncing could be faster- voice / tone analysis is apparently only meant for English because it gives me wildly different readings in other languages (Portuguese)Neutral:- sleep and activity tracking seems to be ok but not better than other devicesGood:- watch warns you when it’s finished charging",3
685,"I got this mainly for the voice recognition ability but it doesn't ""hear"" at all it seems.While it does seem to recognize the way I speak to others in a spot on way, it doesn't unless I'm in completely quiet conditions.This was something I really liked the idea of but just doesn't execute when I need it.I should've never bought this thing until it was a couple models deep to work out the kinks.I don't think it quite registers an individuals personal sleeping needs. It constantly tells me I should take it easy for the day because it says I don't sleep well.The battery doesn't last long and on top of that is hard to figure out how to get it in the clamp style charger so it in fact charges.The band is also quite large on me for a small, but maybe they sent me a medium instead. It just doesn't hold well around my wrist.Regrettable purchase",3
686,"I'm not a guy that wears any type of jewelry.  It band has a comfy fabric band.  Do measure the distance around your hand as its much wider than your wrist.  I ended up purchasing a band the next size up,  (the band, by design, does not come apart)The step calculation seems accurate.  automatically detects rums/walks, but fails to detect workouts on elliptical.  need to manually enter those.Sleep feature works and proves that I sleep horriblyBody fat analysis is kinda creepy.Tone is just an unused feature as other reviews indicate it chews up battery.Note - it comes w/ a 6 month membership the allows access to all features.  $3.99 / month if you want to continue w/ all the features.  Check out the web site and you'll find it's pretty limited without paying",4
687,"Some of the reviews seem harsh, but I think it’s based on your understanding of technology and what you’re after. For me, I enjoy the insights into my TDEE and it’s helping me figure out an overall average based on daily lifestyles that I will ultimately use for how to manage my weight ONCE I get to a state of management. If you’re a novice, I don’t think it’s the right watch. But if you understand the analytics and don’t need a screen 24:7 it’s perfect. Best purchase I’ve made because I do honestly wear it 24/7. Not so much with the Apple Watch.",5
688,"Great for sleep tracking, the voice tone option is fun (but drains the battery quickly), and app is easy to navigate with lots of good programs you can participate in. The only real issue I have is that it’s giving me a rash where the green light emits from. ??? I move it around my wrist do it’s not always on the sale spot, and started wiping it with rubbing alcohol to see if maybe it was just getting dirty (and letting it dry before putting it back on), but it keeps happening—it’ll be the thing that makes me stop using it if I can’t find a solution. I wear a watch on my other wrist every day, and a bracelet that I never remove and neither if those give me a problem, so it’s definitely the Halo and the reason for 4 stars despite liking everything else about it.",4
689,"I've had two Fitbits, and while at first having info on my wrist was cool, it got old quickly. I enjoy the data but I don't need to be motivated by my device couch to 5k style nor do I need calls and texts on my wrist.  The halo has great data collection in a sleek band that doesn't beep, vibrate or remind me to do anything. The application provides data and suggestions as well as more personalized data summaries. Example nexus between cardio and resting heart rate., cardio based points instead of just steps. I haven't tried the tone aspect because it just too much but all in all consider the halo a data collector that provides ideas and opportunities when on your terms, i.e. open the application as many or as few times as you like . . . .",4
690,I really like how easy it was to set up. I like the body composition part. I feel like the data is accurate. The things that I wish it did. First it would be really awesome if it connected with the weight watchers app. Second I work in a very active setting and take a walk in the evening within 2 full days of wearing the device I had earned 325 points. I feel like I don't really have anything to work towards. I wish maybe it could give you a base week and then give you different weekly point goals. I would still buy again it's very comfortable and I feel like the price is good and honestly not having a screen I don't get obsessed with steps. The band is easy to clean also.,4
691,"I love everything about this band. My favorite part is being able to see how I sound to others on the mobile app. It is helping me be more aware of the way I sound when I say things. I am a bit reserved so a lot of my words come off as restrained even when I don't recognize it. I really like the detail put into the sleep tracking function. It has helped me to recognize and understand why I could sleep and still not be rested some days. However, I wish there was a way for it to register naps during the day as well. The body fat function is interesting. I like being able to adjust and see where I need to set my goals for health.  The activity tracker is great and the activity score sure can keep you motivated, but I have panic attacks. I would like to be able to differentiate between a panic attack and activity. The accuracy of my activity score is effected by panic attacks. Adding a notes box in the activity section would be enough for me, but maybe adding some mental health aspects to the band like that could be something for the future.  Overall I really love this band. The suggestions I added are just things I have noticed that would make it that much better.",5
692,"I signed up to get the Halo early back in September, then ordered the Fitbit Inspire, just in case I did not get selected for early delivery. These are my first experiences with trackers and my main goal was tracking sleep patterns. The Fitbit does seem to do a better job at night. I have had several nights with incomplete data on the Halo, but no disruption on the Inspire (and yes, I wore both for several weeks once the Halo arrived). The app for the Halo is slick. If I chose to take advantage of everything, I would probably rate it much higher. However, for basics, the Inspire meets my needs very well. Perhaps as I get a few more months into it, my usage will shift more towards the Halo...For now, I appreciate wearing long sleeves so I don't have to explain why I have a tracker on both wrists!One point I need to make...I am not a person who is married to my cell phone. Having to pull my phone out just to check something as simple as the step count or battery life is a definite negative to not having a screen.",3
693,"Haters gonna hate, but this is exactly what I needed.My phone is always with me, so I didn't want another screen to look at.The app is easy to use. And the monthly subscription is only $4 vs other sports bands $30.The workouts on the app are in 1,5,15 minute intervals, which makes it less intimidating and more motivating.Most of us can find 5 minutes to do an exercise.I haven't used the voice tracker function, so can't comment on that. The sleep tracker works very well, as does the activity tracker.Instead of daily goals or steps, it is set to a weekly goal, which is nice if you have a couple lazy days, you can still make it up the rest of the week.I think the most eye opening thing for me was the activity tracker active vs sedentary time. I really was surprised how many hours in my day were sedentary.  It's really helped get me up and moving throughout the day.The body fat scanner seems to be controversial,  but you can ""hide "" your photos if you can't stomach looking at them. And just have the data  on screen.I am thankful I bought this band. I just hope Amazon doesn't discontinue it🙄",5
694,"Pros:-Comfortable and minimalistic: The look of this device sleek and I rarely feel it on my wrist. I have had it on for 4 month is it causes me no problems.-Sleep tracking is good: This feature contains a lot of information and has been the most useful part of this device.Cons:-CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE that they keep your generated body images and use them for machine learning: They say that don't keep the images you take while using the body app feature, but they say nothing about the generated images they create using those pictures which are EXTREMELY SIMILAR to the originals. It creeps me out knowing that they are stored in a database somewhere.-Voice and mood recognition feature is worthless: The only time I can see this feature being of any use is if you do a lot of speeches or presentations. For day to day use it doesn't make sense. How am I suppose to know what I said at 3:42 PM yesterday? This feature also drains the battery 4x faster. With the microphone on it will last 1 day instead of 4.",3
695,"Allow me to premise that the actual Halo Band is wonderful and I love it. I've been using it religiously and love the labs and the sleep tracking feature and have sung its praises to my friends and family. This is where things go south: I got off the phone with an Amazon customer service agent who was extremely inflexible when I explained that my charging clip suddenly stopped working and would not charge the Halo. He would not offer to replace the charging clip and instead offered me a refund for $68.00 - the original price I paid for the Halo back in October - and I needed to now purchase a brand new one for $99.00. I was incredulous and asked why I would need to pay $30 more for a new Halo when I just need a charging clip, moreover, complicating things by requiring a brand new purchase and making me pay more money when the charging clip was defective. This agent on the phone was audibly frustrated and had a ""take it or leave it"" attitude and I said I would call back the next day and ask to speak to a manager and he abruptly ended the call. I was polite through the entire call and simply stated that as a brand loyal Amazon customer who is in the Amazon ecosystem, that it was not right I should have to pay for an entirely new Halo, pay MORE and not be more flexible. I subscribe to Amazon Music HD, own a Fire Tab 10 and planned to stick the Lab subscription service with the Halo. This is not the way to rectify something as simple as a defective charging clip and to instead, make a loyal Amazon customer run around in circles and make things more complicated and unfairly make me pay more $$$. It's not the $$$ so much as the principle. Simply do right by your customer if something was defective. I even stated how happy I was with the Halo band to this agent but he would not budge. I've had wonderful Amazon customer service in the past and am surprised and for now, writing this agent off as having had a bad day and the experience an anomaly. I hope Amazon reads this review by the time I re-contact them so that this can be fairly corrected and I remain a brand loyal and happy Amazon customer. Thank you.",1
696,I’ve been wearing the halo for a few days now and love it. As for people saying that it’s not comfortable and showing pictures of it cinched super tight on their wrist.. well duh it’s not going to fell good. If you have it on correctly it should feel like any other device you might wear. I personally don’t even notice that it’s on my wrist most of the time.  I don’t use the voice tone portion of the device.  Sleep Tracker has helped me learn more about how I sleep and it explains a lot as to why I’m so tired some days.  I really like the movement point system. It entertains my competitive side to me.  The 3D body comp scan will get you in check real fast and it’s accurate to other body comp scans I’ve had done.  The lab portion of the app is nice to give you challenges or help motivate you to do better. I also like that they have free workout built into it.My suggestions for Amazon right now for the halo is.. I wish it would vibrate or beep if you’ve been sitting too long. And that the band be a little easier to take on and off. The harder velcro pieces can be a pain to get the plastic loop by.,5
697,"Eh, not a bad device for the price, but I’d still pick my Apple Watch over it. My husband bought this for me as a Christmas present since I’d expressed interest in it.  I have a small wrist and it feels uncomfortable and too big for my wrist. It does seem like it does as good a job of tracking sleep than my Apple Watch. I thought the body fat feature would be a bit more intuitive, but a) it didn’t seem to use the watch at all, so it seems like this could somehow be utilized separately. B) it way overestimated my body fat. I’m an obviously thin, fit woman who has curvy features but minimal fat I could lose. It had me as almost overweight. I was optimistic that it would do a good job of tracking my workouts, but I can’t say I’m impressed at all. And I turned the tone feature was off within a day for not picking up any of my speech as anything remotely positive. Basically it’s a “fitness” tracking that beats you up and makes you feel bad about being negative and too sedentary and too fat. Even when you’re not.",3
698,"I like it so far. Still not sure if I like it better than the fitness tracking ring I was eyeing, but this was $65 compared to $200 for the ring I was looking at. At that price point it is solid. At $100 it’s still a great deal compared to what’s out there.It’s comfortable, accurate, easier to wear than my Apple Watch is when sleeping and I can still track my fitness when I wear one of my regular watches.My main complaint (albeit small) and the only reason I don’t give it 5 stars, is that it doesn’t (yet) have the ability to share your data with the Health App on your Apple phone which aggregates everything else I already do. No biggie though. Maybe they’ll integrate eventually. Also has a funky charger, but it works.Overall I’m happy after a few days, but will update after a few months.",4
699,"I have been using the Halo since beta and have waited to write this review.  I have owned a Fitbit for many years and have loved the way it is set up but Fitbit has released hardware that dies within a year - so I moved to find a replacement.  I thought Halo would be it.  I was excited and glad to have another option.  However, Halo fails to meet the needs.  The battery for me is the biggest negative for me.  The Halo only maintains its charge for 1-2 Days - I usually lose nights of sleep information. The way the App is set up it is difficult to view your information over a longer stretch of time.  The tone feature is just a novelty that wears off in a few months or less.  Also, its a battery drain.  I thought I would be all in on the body scan...again, lost its novelty after 3 months - I haven't scanned in 96 days. And finally, the way it tracks activities is ""ok"" but I do miss being able to see how I spent my time. You can only see steps by days.The fact that you have to pay for a subscription after a period of time - I have no interest in the subscription unfortunately.It was a good attempt by Amazon - I'm sure they can do better.  I am usually a HUGE advocate for Amazon technology but this one I think is a pass.  At least for now.  I wish they had done a user forum with the beta group but they did not.",2
700,"I have a lot of Amazon devices... Kindles, FireSticks, Echo Show/Dot/Studio and overall they are good. I was excited to experience the new Halo when invited as part of the Early Access program. I wanted to like this device but unfortunately its really not ready for prime time (no pun intended). The idea is great but the execution and overall experience is not.- battery life is horrible- mobile app is OK,  but not great- the charging clip is flimsy and clunky. Unlike say Apple Watch where a magnet sucks the device into place, this clip is like trying figure out how a piece goes into a jigsaw puzzle, incredibly annoying. And some days when I thought it was charging it actually was not and would be dead. This is probably one of the worst parts of the overall system design. Just terrible.- the one button user interfacer with led light is not intuitive- the device constantly loses sync connectivity with the IOS app and its a nightmare every time to get them to reconnect- the standard band is horrible, really hard to put on and clasp, although once on its decently comfortable- functionality wise, the voice tone feature is just OK and seems more gimmicky. And it's also the kiss of death for battery life; the sleep feature is pretty good but some nights would just get lost or never get tracked because of connectivity issues; I lost enough interest with the above problems that I never even bothered to use the BMI featuresI will continue to experiment with it and hope it improves over time. But I think that's just it, it feels like an experiment at this point, not a product that's fully baked, So overall do not recommend it right now.",2
701,"Halo is amazing!! It encourages me to walk every day and meet weekly activity goals. I love that it tracks my weekly sleep trends, discourages sedentary time, and measures % body fat. I’ve also improved my vocal tone after learning how I sound to people throughout the day. My favorite feature is the sleep stories. There’s a wide variety of options from calming stories that happen at night, to adventures in exotic locations to aquatic themes. My only suggestion for improvement is for Amazon to update the story menu more frequently as I’ve listened to them multiple times-they’re so great. Halo is life-changing.",5
702,"I got the Halo two months ago. My primary interest was in the tone function. I’ve previously used fitbits and various health apps (such as MyFitnessPal).The tone function is pretty useless tbh. It drains the battery in less than a day and the feedback you get is hopelessly vague. No transcription or indication of what, exactly, sounded ‘surprised’, ‘condescending’ or ‘happy’. So, meh.As a fitness tracker, it’s great that it has no screen and works 100% from the app. I really like that. And with no tone enabled, the battery lasts a solid week.I think it dramatically over-tracks steps. It’s telling me I did 11,000 today, with one short walk and housework. Still, I get ‘heart healthy green’ every week, which is a major difference from the ‘you’re a bit of a failure’ type messaging from the Fitbit.The sleep tracking is making me very worried, because it says I never get more than 5 1/2 hrs per night, so I have to look into that some more. It doesn’t have as much interesting info as the Fitbit, but its utilitarian feedback is quite Gen X, so I like it.",3
703,It does what it says so with that I’m happy. I was excited to get it. I would have given it 5 stars ⭐️ but infrared or metal kind of bothers me. However that’s no true negative reflection on the device. I need to invest in a sport band. I have the rose color but it picks up dirt from everywhere but its light so expected. I would recommend Halo as a useful and beneficial purchase. I am ordering another one for my daughter. Best feature is sleep monitoring. It’s offers so many other features to support health with and without the membership. Besides $4 is way cheaper than gym fees. It have workouts and information. Overall Halo offers more than just step counting and heart rate.Hope this helps someone. ☺️,4
704,Would like trade in option,4
705,"I do have mix feeling to the device. First, it looks nice, fit well and comfortable to wear. Some people said it is bulky but I do not think so. The band could be better anyway.Come to the feature, there is a big gap between what I expected and what it delivered.- The step tracking is ok but no elevation track.- There is a little sport activity, no bike mode, no cardio...- No screen is good and bad. I do not need to take a look at it all day but hate to have to open the app just to check the progress- No sleep movement, just sleep stage tracking- The body index is a joke. I measure myself at a professional machine and my body fat is around 12%, the Halo app show me 21%, make me feel bad about my body :D- Tone analysis virtually did not work at all, at least for me.Conclusion: the device itself is not bad but it does not deliver the minimum features for myself to keep it. Will return and wait for the improved version in the future.",3
706,This is a good first attempt by Amazon but really needs some improvements.1st  I think bigest problem is it charges really slow.  I mean really slow.  Needs 3+ hours to recharge.2nd  The band it comes with is very tacky looking.  Not many options for better bands available.3rd  Has a tendency to over count steps by alot.  Had to return first one I got for this problem.4th  Amazon puts this item on sale every other month so wait till it sells for under $55.,3
707,"The halo does everything it advertises- the sleep tracking, the motion detection, all of it- I just hate the band it comes on, so both my wife and I hate wearing it. I signed on to see if I could return it, but saw the return window was closed.  I have a Fitbit watch and my wife has an Apple Watch. The stretchy fabric/silicon bands for the Apple Watch would make this a much better product.Pros: 6 months of Halo mobile app use. The sleep cast, behavioral changes, reminders are all great. Halo is like a little trainer in my phone.-battery life (when the Tone mode is off)Cons: the watchband is so uncomfortable and obtrusive and I can’t change it.Tone mode drains the battery.Charger is finicky and you have to wiggle the band around in the charger to make sure it touches.If I could just add the device to an existing band (like how they have those compasses you can put on a watchband) I might improve the rating. But if you already have an Apple Watch, I’d just wave you off.",3
708,"I tried it for about a week side by side with Fitbit versa 3. Heart Rate, Step Counts, and Sleep Tracking were rarely aligned between the devices. Comparing steps alone the Halo was not tracking all steps, tested through the day, and by the end of the day it would add up to around 500 step shortage on average.The Halo did a pretty good job of detecting walking or running exercise, other workouts were not detected however.I wanted to try it for the “Tone” detection. The Halo fell pretty flat in detecting conversations. One day it only detected a single conversation for the entire day. When it did detect the conversation or when I manually monitored using the “Live” feature the feedback was unusual and not very valuable overall. I think the way the the data is graphed in the app could be done a lot better.The available connecting apps are very limited and no Apple Health support.Decided to wipe and stop using the Halo after a week.",2
709,"I was excited to receive my Halo! I’ve had it for well over 2.5 months. It does everything it states it would do. Sleep tracker and steps are accurate and I find it to be comfortable once you get used to it. Sometimes I forget I have it on.  Battery life is ok with basic use, but it’s not something to turn up my nose at. Have not used the workout videos, but it’s a nice feature to have accessible.  The relaxation and meditation videos/sounds are beneficial.I don’t understand all of these negative reviews. It seems like people just like to bitch and complain and not give something a chance before hopping on to give a negative review. It’s not like this piece cost $200+, so I don’t know what you all were expecting.  If you read the usability, it does exactly what it says it is supposed to do.The people complaining about skin sensitivity —That has nothing to do with the actual watch itself or the quality! It just means you have sensitive skin.The people complaining about the bulk of the watch—It’s a fitness tracker.  The thickness is no different than a basic watch.Ridiculous how many people are slandering Amazon for this fitness tracker.  Sounds to me that a lot have the Covid quarantine grumps and have nothing better to do.",5
710,"Thought I would try the Halo as a family member has one and suggested it. It does have some good features-access to workout videos, slim and comfortable design. I do not like the fact it will ""listen"" to you periodically to assess your voice (this can be disabled). You don't know when or where it will listen, which can be an issue if you work in a field where confidentiality is required.In terms of the assessment of your activity level, I think this falls short. It appears to measure it based upon your heart rate for activity. There is a goal that is set for your weekly activity to try to reach. If you do not, you get penalized for this and it is SUBTRACTED from your weekly goal. This is problematic in two ways. First, if you have a job that does not allow for being as active as it requires, you get penalized. If you have a low heart rate and your activity does not reach whatever the standard is set, you get penalized. I thought this was a fluke so did increase activity/workout and it still did not seem enough-this got kind of depressing, negative reinforcement instead of positive. I got to the point where I had enough and I don't use it anymore, it has become a fixture in my drawer.Not saying this is a bad device, just not for me. I think I will go with fitbit next time.In all fairness, this is a new product and it may improve. I will keep it in my drawer and maybe resurrect it at a later date-but by then, I will need to pay for the subscription you receive free.**UPDATE** I just returned it. I am going to try something else.",2
711,"The only thing I don’t like is the measurement for the wristband is not very accurate. My wrist measured for a large, but that ended up being too big and I had to buy the medium band.  Other than that, I like this band.  Very comparable to the Whoop.  I have read some other comments and it seems they don’t truly understand what this band is supposed to achieve.  It has really helped me keep a good eye on my sleep patterns.  When you workout a lot and really focused on getting the best performance, this is one thing to really keep track of and how to improve it.  Improving tour sleep pattern really helps with your focus and energy when it comes to weightlifting.  I love that you can get a much accurate body fat percentage with the body scan and the workout videos and lab challenges that come with the subscription to help you achieve your goals to having an overall better body composition.  Battery life is good as long as you don’t use the tone of voice detection.  I did like it at first, but it really killed the battery.  Overall, this is a really good product if you have an active lifestyle or trying to get into an active lifestyle.",5
712,"I mainly bought the Halo because of my frustration with my Fitbit Versa 2. I tend to sleep a few hours a night, wake up and read an hour, and then sleep a few more hours. The Versa will only capture one of the 3 hour blocks, and not tally all my sleep into my sleep score. The Halo does a better job and will pick up the full night. But, I took an hour nap today, and the Halo missed it. The Halo also consistently gives me terrible sleep scores. I'm not a good sleeper, but I'm getting numbers in the 20's and 30's every night - I'm restless at night and the Halo is too sensitive.One thing that I think is a shocking omission of the Halo is not having an altimeter. How can a device properly monitor activity without one? The Halo does monitor your body temperature during sleep, but unless I get sick I don't understand what value this feature has.I really miss phone notifications, and the ability to be able to glance at my wrist and view the time or my heart rate. I'm also surprised that the Halo doesn't measure blood oxygen levels or heart rate variability - two things that are particularly important to me. At least it doesn't have the constant garbage cluttering up the phone app, trying to sell you additional services, devices, and features like Fitbit's app.I've had the Halo a week so far, and as it stands there's no way I'm going to pay an additional monthly fee after the trial is over. But, I'm going to give Amazon a chance before I return the Halo. There's a lot they can fix via software, and they better do it quick.",2
713,"Love this device. Easy 2 set up & use. All the supporting fitness add ons including exercise with celebs like Halle Berry & Russell Wilson is pretty cool. There is a ton of data captured including body shape and mass index using the phone camera. Helps reduce stress by tracking my voice. Amazing!!! The Charger can be little complicated to get the device to seat especially in the dark. Band can be itchy at times. Also, Some of the weekly trending data not easy to visualize compared to apple app. I love this device for it’s simplicity overall and effectiveness. Not having a screen to distract me is awesome!  Recommended it to all my family and friends",4
714,"I ordered a Halo band in June 2021, I liked it, at first, but then near the end of March of 2022 it stopped charging. I went through troubleshooting with Amazon customer service, and eventually they sent me another device...not the band, not a new charger, just the little device itself. They sent a refurbished one instead of a new one, which was irritating, but whatever. Then around 3 months later, in July 2022, my band disconnected from my app out of nowhere and wouldn't reconnect. It wouldn't pair when I tried to set it back up...it wouldn't even factory reset. I tried all the things while on the phone with customer service. Then she said they couldn't send me a new one because it wasn't under warranty! The year warranty for my original Halo was up the previous month, in June, but that original device had already died! Why would the original warranty apply to the piece of garbage replacement they sent? Finally, after about a week I got approved to have another one sent out, yet another refurbished one. Well, it hasn't even been a full month and the exact same thing that happened in July happened again! Disconnected, won't reconnect or pair up, won't factory reset... NOTHING. This may be a tempting but for some, decent price and the app (when my band was working) has a lot of cool features. But the device itself is absolute trash. Save yourself the aggravation and find something more reliable. I know I'm going to.",1
715,"The sleep tracking is amazing. I work in EMS, and it is able to accurately track my crazy sleep patterns. The time I fell asleep, when and how long I stayed awake for, and the stages of sleep I was able to get (although I don’t know how accurate the sleep stages are). My only complaint is that it doesn’t track naps throughout the day, but that is a super minor problem not worth crying over. All the other features of the tracker are great and just adds to its value!",5
716,"I’m not sure why but almost every day there’s some kind of gap in the data. Like it just stops working for a few hours. It’s not dead, I wear it all the time the same way. It misses my sleep and messes with calories. I get it’s not an end all be all device but it shouldn’t just drop data at random points. I switch from the whoop to this and over all I’m still unsure. The whoop is better for sure but the price is too much for me. This was the best options for the minimalist tracker. The only reason I haven’t switched back it because the price. But after the included 6 month trial of the halo, I’m not sure if I’ll stick around. It’s great for a starting device, maybe some software updates will improve this but who knows. Again, don’t get me wrong, this device is great for what it is. Not not as competitive with whoop as I was hoping.",3
717,I use it for everything but it fell apart and I don’t know how to seal the back plate back on it,3
718,"I have had for a little over a year now. It preforms it basic functions well, but the light on the side and the charger are worse for wear.When I first got it was impressed by the robust app and the range of data tracking. The voice tracking I never felt comfortable with so I ever used it. For the app portion of this I am pretty well satisfied, though I hate that there is not an integrated food diary/journal.The band it is self was pretty impressive and cheap feeling, just to be honest, but it preformed it's function well and at t least there wasn't a screen for me to crack or scratch. About 6 months in it be came finicky to charge and the side light indicator began to send out random patterns of light. Now a year and a couple months in that light is shot and the charger is hit or miss. I was hoping it would have lasted a bit longer.",2
719,"When I was looking for an activity tracker, I chose Halo because it can be synchronized with the Weight Watcher app.The activity is indeed synchronized with my WW app, which is good because it gives me more ""WW points"" for my meals.I like very much the sleep tracking on Halo but it is not automatically synced with WW and I would have to enter my sleep patterns manually, which I don't do. Also, if you have a long insomnia during the night, it ""forgets"" the first part of the night and counts only the last part. You have to sync the first part while awake and then when you fall asleep again, the two parts of the night are registered.But generally, I am rather happy with my Halo, I check it every morning and at night, I usually don't do it during the day.",4
720,"I use mostly for the sleep It's OK, just not always sure if tight. Who knows?",3
721,"Poor battery life, doesn’t function up to what was advertised.",3
722,"I really wanted to love this. I heavily researched the Halo band prior to purchasing it. I got it while it was still invite only. In the end I returned it after 11 days of use.Initial set up for me was somewhat of a pain. When doing voice I read the passages for so long I actually started to get irritated. So I started to think it was going to have irritated as my neutral tone. Despite people saying they didn't want to be listened to all the time. I eventually got upset that it wasn't listening enough. With 2 day battery life it was only listening sometimes. If I wanted it to listen all the time my battery would only last 1 day. In the end I turned it off. Tone had been a big factor in my purchase.Another factor for me was the body scan. Which when trying to do my scans it often made the app crash and close. So doing scans for me usually took about 20 minutes in total so I slowly stopped trying to use it.In the end the last 2 things I was using for was sleep tracking and counting my steps. I did notice if I fell asleep on the couch it did not count it as sleep. I also had a night I slept under 4hrs, that did not count it as well.Slowly every feature I wanted was no longer working. On day 10 I happened to look at my steps before getting on my elliptical. And that's when I noticed it wasn't counting my steps properly. And that's when I decided to return it. Overall, I was very unhappy with this purchase and will be going back to my Fitbit",2
723,"While it's a great product, I don't always use it, and I'm not one to pay for an app I don't use. Once you cancel the membership that comes with this device, you can't restart it. I recently went to try and restart mine and it won't let me even though my band is only a year old and I let the membership end in April. It's a waste of my money if I can't use it to the full extent I want to. Very disappointed.",2
724,"A lot of complaints that I see are from people thinking that this will be exactly like the big name smart watches. I purposefully enjoy this product. I do with there was a clock face like how they do it with the echo devices I believe that would be awesome!Long story short I needed a monitoring device that wouldn't be messed with by the children that I work with wanting to play with the watch and mess it up. I do need the heart monitoring because of a heart birth defect that requires monitoring, so having the halo on my wrist all the time and being able to send the information to my doctor instead of having to wear a device around my neck all day. This device is very helpful as well for my sleep and how to improve it. I also absolutely love the temperature monitoring for while I sleep so I know when I have a fever and need to check my health in the morning.The device does everything is says and with the subscription I am slowly getting into the different workouts that it suggests. The device has held highly to my expectations especially with how it tracks everything I need it to for my personal health. I am very satisfied with this amazon product!",5
725,"* A no display stylish fitness band. fabric style band looks good on wrist.** Battery:  Battery life is good if you use this without a mic. With mic, it stays mostly for 1 and a half day. That the reason for 4 stars as from amazon I expect better battery life. Without the mic just for sleep and activities battery stay for a week.* Points system to track your health and activities is good and an alternate way of steps tracking way.* Checking Body fat with the phone app is easy and takes only 2 mins. You can keep that or delete that data after checking.* Sleep accuracy is very good.* Lot of lab integration options to find more ways to stay healthy.",4
726,"The Amazon Halo has real promise as device with some unique features already - Tone and Body Scan and others that don't exist yet. The problems are pretty hefty though. The sleep tracking is BADLY inaccurate - I use multiple device and this one is the least accurate.  The Tone interpretation is fascinating and actually pretty accurate but you really don't know what to with the information you have - badly needs some insights and best action kind of analysis to go with it The Body Scan is perhaps the most accurate and the most interesting in its approach. I wear it every day and check results, but it reminds me (and that's why it gets 3 stars not 1 star or 2) of the Amazon Echo in the beginning, you saw the promise but it did very little and now look at it. This may not be at that scale. There is a LOT of promise in this device but for now its feature poor and advice averse so its very limited in what it does. Hopefully software updates will enrich it and also fix the flaws.  I like it but for the future.",3
727,"I was excited about this until I received it and used it for the last 3 months. The premise of meaningful data on a lite weight band that doesn't have a screen to distract you sounded great.The voice recognition feature to give me feedback on how I sounded to others throughout the day was one of the reasons I was interested. Turns out it does not do a good job at capturing the tone correctly and with the microphone on, the battery is even worse than usual.Battery life is 4 days with microphone off and less than 3 days with the microphone on. This is embarrassingly low considering there is no screen and it only syncs via Bluetooth hourly.The sleep tracking has some potential but it stops tracking after 8hrs sometimes or 10yrs others. Not that most people sleep that long but due to my job, I sometimes sleep a few hours, wake up and work for 1-3 hours then go back to sleep. This causes the sleep tracking to only track the first part or the second part and forget the other so it doesn't track all the time I sleep.The app is a mess. It doesn't show data in a way that is actionable or meaningful at all. It doesn't easily show you the history of any of the things it tracks. It doesn't point out things that you might want to see like a spike in heart rate that is above the normal average, changes in sleep patterns, changes in sedentary time, or anything you would expect from a fitness band especially when you consider how it was promoted.The band has a lot of potential but until the battery life is improved and the app is completely overhauled, the only this this band does is charge you for a band and a monthly subscription to give Amazon all your personal data.I understand that something like this comes with inherent privacy concerns and I was willing to live with that but only if it provided some value. Sadly, the Halo showed me zero value.I am past my return period and I am stuck with it. It's so bad I would feel bad taking money from anyone for it so I won't sell it.",1
728,"I bought it last October and used it continuously for 6 months, including while sleeping. My experience has been mixed. It does a good job of detecting activity intensity and duration. It uses a simplified 'activity points' approach to track and encourage physical activity. This may be enough for some people, but others who crave raw data will find this lacking. There are various 'labs' you can try out for sleep, activity, etc - I found these to be moderately useful.But this is when I stopped using the band regularly: I started having wrist pain. I am not sure what the source is, but once I stopped wearing the band at night, the pain has slowly diminished. My best guess is that the band is pressing against the wrist, and is probably getting compressed under the arm. Wearing it loosely didn't seem to help. Not sure, but I stopped wearing it at night. Now I wear it just during activities to get the measurements going, until I replace it with another device. YMMV.",3
729,I like the app and what the halo tracks. It seems to do a great job and be accurate.  My only problem is that it is really uncomfortable. The tracker itself is really thick and when it is around my wrist it digs into my wrist bones.  The app says to wear it up a little higher so I did that and it was better but when I sleep with it it leaves bruises and marks on me. I had to wear it even higher today because the original spot I had it is now bruised.  In halo’s defense I do tend to sleep on my arms and bruise easy so this may not be an issue for most people. I am hoping I will eventually get used to it but I also think that halo 2.0 needs to make it thinner and more comfortable.,4
730,"To start off, the app is great. It has lots of recipes, quick workouts, healthy snacks, tips and tricks, and the way they cast information from the halo band is nice too.ButThere are too many down sides to consider keeping the band.For starters, the band has bruised mine and my husband's wrists after 3 days of use. We weren't wearing them tight and found the most uncomfortable moments with the bands were in the mornings after sleeping with them. Whats the point of sleep tracking if it hurts to wear the hardware?Next, I found that the pink and rose gold band gets dingy very quickly. My husband who had the black band didn't have this issue.Next, the band doesn't acurratly measure workout intensities. For example, the band game me 2pts intense workout for going poop.......yeah it doesn't make sense. Its not motivating like I wished for it to be.The voice sensor which catches tone would be great! But to use it like I wanted it would drain the battery and when I didn't the ""measure less"" option it seemed it did it once a day around 10am. That doesn't give me an accurate measure at all.So many things just don't add up to the anticipated device I thought this would be.",2
731,"When I first got this I really liked it. I wore it constantly for I would say about 6 or 7 months and had no issue. I think the app itself is easy to use and the daily health/fitness tracking is motivating from my POV. I think that the tone feature like kind of works, but I would take it with a grain of salt. It gives you I would say a more general concept vs being actually accurate with specific moments from what I have seen - unless they reporting is extremely delayed. I think the sleep tracking could be improved. I feel like it definitely doesn’t track well if you are to take a nap and then actually go to bed later that night.But my largest problem is the fact that out of no where this past fall I had to stop wearing it since it was leaving what I could only describe as a burn on my arm. A large red patch eventually turns brown and then the skin peels. The first burn I had took about 3 months to fully go away and I had to fully stop wearing the tracker. Any time I put it back on it instantly came back. Well after 3 months and a month of kind of forgetting I even had the thing, I decided to try again. And within a week what do you know, a burn. The band is clean and so is the tracker. I clean it according to instructions. Based on the mark and position of the burn it is definitely the halo tracker itself causing this. So either the film has some how worn away that the lights have full access to my skin or this product is just unreliable past 6-7 months of use.Either way VERY disappointed. I will be looking for a refund from Amazon for the original cost I paid for the band and will not be renewing.",1
732,"The Halo band was offered to us as a deal of the day at a price of $59.99. My wife was looking to buy a tracking band like a Fitbit. I showed her this Halo band which we had never heard of before. Upon reviewing the product and the price reduction from its original price of $99.99, she decided to give this a try. I bought this for my wife and I followed the instructions on Amazon’s website. Instructions said to measure your wrist with a tape measure and then compare it to their chart to get the right size. I measured my wife’s wrist and she fell between a Medium and a Large. We were gonna opt for a medium because my wife is petite, but when we read the instructions further, it said if you fall between two sizes, to opt for the larger size. So we purchased the large size. When we received the Halo band, it was obviously way too big as you can clearly see in the picture. There is no way to shorten the band and it sticks out at the top because the Velcro ends down the band further and so the end won’t even stick to itself. Unfortunately, Amazon customer service won’t exchange it for a new size. Amazon will only refund our money and we can then repurchase it, but we would now have to pay full price. I don’t think we should be penalized $40 for a mistake that was clearly their fault. It’s unfortunate, because my wife was liking the Halo band and we would have kept it. My review would have probably been different, if not for this stupidity. If the price was still $60, or they would have adjusted the price on a second Halo, I even would have bought a second Halo in a medium for myself and just swapped the band with my wife’s. I personally didn’t want to pay $100 and then a $4 per month subscription. This was a very easy fix AMAZON!!! Your customer service should have handled this very differently.",1
733,"I had 3 Halo that had the touch screen bands break and lost the last one doing yard work. Very frustrating since I absolutely love to use the halo.This one has a much better band that doesn’t break or fall off.I am 75 years old and use it to track exercise, sleep and heart. This has been a great tool in keeping me and wife healthy.Only suggestion is to develop exercises and diets for the over 65 group.",5
734,,4
735,"I am so impressed by this!! I have wanted a high quality tracker for awhile, but the last thing I needed was another screen in my life. Halo was exactly what I was looking for.So far it’s been very accurate for me. I love how it logs your exercise according to heart rate and not steps, so you get more points for intense exercise. The sleep tracker has also been completely accurate for me so far.They also have these “labs” where you can try out good behaviors, though I haven’t tried that yet.At first I wished that there would be more options on the app for customization, but I’ve since decided that the simplicity is better. I’m trying to cut down my screen time and it would have been one other thing that I was constantly busy trying to recustomize.I can’t review the tone recognition because I don’t like the idea so I muted my mic and don’t use that feature.The body scan wasn’t accurate for me, but I have a smart scale for that so it doesn’t bother me.All in all amazing tracker! Even though I’m not using two of its main features, the two that I am using (exercise and sleep) is so accurate that it’s totally worth it for that alone.",5
736,Like sleep tracker when I can sync up in the morning,3
737,"I really wanted to like it but it has a ways to go. Pros:-First form factor is good, light, compact, easy to forget about it.-Sleep tracking seems to be fairly accurate. The mornings I woke up tired matched a poor sleep record.- App has meals and workout programs-Battery life (if not using Tone) lasts 4+daysCons:- Charging is a real pain. Halo has to be perfectly positioned or it won’t charge. I put it on, had the red light, set it down, came back it and it wasn’t charged. This happened twice before I simply removed the strap to keep it from interfering. It’s an awful design.- Tone: this way more of a gimmick and essentially useless as it drains the battery in a day.- Does not connect to Apple health.- Heart rate was way off compared to my Polar H10 HR strap (It will never be as accurate but I was expecting it to be within 3%)- Body Scan although very accurate I can see where this might lead people to have an unhealthy fixation on the number it provides.If you’re looking for something slightly more advanced than a Fitbit without a screen, this is it. If you are looking for anything more, check out Whoop, more expensive though. If they can fix the cons this would create a much better device experience.",2
738,"This is my first fitness band. I got it on discount via some early access. As I had  never used a fitness band, I was honestly a bit skeptical. My job is already at tech and I spend a high amount of time with screens and wasn’t looking for one more techy screen as in smart watch.It’s my first week of use and so far I love it. I especially love the sleep tracking. It is so weird how accurate it is. It also gave me a good idea about percentage of deep sleep vs light sleep vs rem sleep. I didn’t know until having this device my deep sleep rate was less than expected, which is not good for health :(I also like that it has a point based activity tracker with 150 points per week recommendation at least. When you see you are still at 50 points at the end of the week, you certainly push yourself to complete that 100 remaining :)Also, I have skin allergies including to metals and perfume and haven’t been able to use watches since several years now. I was worried this band would irritate my skin. It did a bit but it went away thankfully because I really want to continue using this.",5
739,"There's a lot of things they get right with this product. The emotion detection seems to work well and is an insight not really offered any where else.Seems overall to do a pretty great job tracking. Steps and sleep seemed roughly on par with what my Apple Watch tracks.Besides the voice this doesn't offer anything you haven't seen elsewhere.They track a lot of data and make that data apparent to you, but it doesn't feel useful. I think the app needs to better suggest what ought to be done for improvements. Some of it's there just not fully.I think it also desperately needs better integrations with other apps, especially some kind of calorie/food tracker.",4
740,"The Halo is able to track several things: steps/activities, sleep, tone of voice and body fat %. I have only used the step counter and sleep tracker. I do wish it had a visual watch so I don't have to wear it & a separate watch. It seems to be pretty accurate though like all step tracker, ie Fitbit, Garmin etc. it seems to pad the step count depending upon how much I move the arm I wear it on. It's close enough though. I won this Halo as part of a contest held for WW participants and it includes the full membership package. After 6 months they will charge $3.99 for the whole package but I can cancel that. The basic tracking of steps & sleep will still be available at no charge.The only disadvantages of this tracker rather than some others is 1) no watch function 2) you have to log into the Halo app to find out #of steps, etc instead of just looking at the Halo itself which means if you are away from your phone you have no idea how many you have taken if you are trying to reach a specific number of steps.The Halo is attractive and lightweight; easy to sleep in.",5
741,The app is easy to use & understandI love how your phone lets you know when the charging is complete.,5
742,"Got this to complement my apple watch tracker. After a couple months, the glass where the sensor resides started coming off. Amazon did offer a replacement. Couple more months after that, the device stopped tracking anything altogether besides the battery level showing on the app. The tracking for activities can be tricky to understand but at least it seems to track sleep pretty well. I’m afraid this device is too fragile and weak compared to the competition. Getting bad after a little under a year since receiving a replacement band (and i don’t put it through anything besides the regular going to the gym thing) is disappointing. I’ve been with my apple watch for about 3 years now without ever having to send it back for any repairs or replacement. You’re out of luck too if outside of the warranty period coz they’ll just tell you to buy a new device",2
743,"My sleep has improved thanks to my wrist teacher.  I love the detailed score and when I get a fair or worse sleep score, I take it personally and try to improve it the next night.  If I get a great score, I know I can go ahead and do variety of activities without sleep-stressing myself out.  If I get a fair score, I usually take it easy.  Unfortunately the detailed sleep score is a premium feature and while I get initial six months for free, I will get sucked into being nickel-and-dimed here.  $3.99 is not a lot to pay per month, but I still wish I could avoid it.",4
744,"I got this device at a discount to see if it would be comparable to the Fitbit that I currently wear. I was drawn by the understated form and presence. It just looks like a bracelet and goes with almost anything. I already have watches that I use, so there is no need for a second one and the lack of a screen is a moot issue to me.I have used the device wide open and I am not impressed with the battery life. If you turn everything on, you will charge this daily so when you shower, put it on the charger. I can say that there is room for improvement with the device when it comes to sleep monitoring and activity. It seems a little off for me. I will continue to monitor the situation and give more feedback if it is required.",4
745,"I have had this for a few weeks and I really do enjoy using it. The app has a lot of benefits to it (exercise, sleep, etc.) and I was annoyed about the battery dying fast when I first got it but the last update seemed to address it pretty well. It's easy to charge and you don't even need to remove the band to do it. I like that this is comfortable enough to sleep in and I wear it in the gym with my FitBit Blaze to see how accurate the HR monitor is and they seem to match up pretty well.The tone feature is nice, I actually use it when I have Zoom meetings at work to make sure I sound pleasant to others. The body scan and body fat measurement was accurate for me as well. I enjoy the Halo over all.",4
746,"I got this during promotion period and took a chance that features would work with IPAD because I don't have an IPhone. For the first 5 weeks I only used the Sleep & Activity and both worked fine. Then I found courage to try the body composition. And the software guided me even on my IPAD to correctly position myself for the camera.What I liked most:Activity: -- the deduction of points for sedentary hours. I think that helps motivation.Sleep: I am in my 80's -- naturally my sleep is always disturbed. The Halo Band is very accurate in rating my sleep. Most of my rating is ""FAIR"" -- but Halo Band gives correct rating ""POOR"" when my is more disturbed!Body Composition: I am underweight for my height. But Halo Band correctly determined that my body composition is border line HIGH. (I am usually a regular GYM person but cannot go to GYM during Pandemic). BMI by using weight, height, and waist would rate be GOOD -- but I found Halo Band to be more accurate.I liked the innovative approach Amazon Halo Band takes! Previously I used POLAR with Chest Strap for over 25 yrs and then used the very 1st version FITBIT.",5
747,"So I bough this as a cheaper alternative to the Whoop band since it’s about 10 dollars cheaper a month after the first 6 months. My biggest complaint with the item is the design is not nearly as comfortable to wear at the whoop band it’s so uncomfortable to wear I have to swap it back in forth between my arms multiple times a day, the part of the band where the “chip” touches your skin the chip sticks out so much further than the curve of the band so it digs deep into your skin, and has to be very tight around your arm to get accurate readings. The battery live is about half of what the app projects and needs to be charged every 2/3 days even with the tone feature set to the bare minimum(cause you can’t turn it off, shocker). Outside of the poor design of the band the app is very simple, the band and app do a good job of tracking your calories and excels at tracking your sleep. But that’s not worth the 50 dollars or the 4 dollars a month that I personally will not be renewing. This fells like amazons attempt to make a product similar Whoop and while the price is better, If you care about the performance whoop is infinitely better.",2
748,"There are several things I enjoy about my halo band: I like how it tracks my movement and sleep, I like how soft the band is, and I like how easy it is to set up. What I don't like about it....there's a lot. I HATE how I can never clean it; while the sleep tracker works, it also doesn't work. Sometimes it doesn't register if I'm awake or asleep so it's not super accurate in tracking sleep. No matter how I clean it or how often I clean it, if I sweat then it STINKS. The voice recognition drains the battery so quickly that it needs to be charged almost twice in a 24 hour period. The charger is super sensitive and I have to wiggle my band around before the charger senses the band, and I hate....I mean, I hate it with the burning passion of 10,000 suns is the app. It's ridiculously slow, I constantly have to close it for the band to sync to the app. It's super glitch and maybe because I don't have the monthly subscription anymore, but I can't review previous days activities. The app is god AWFUL and needs to be fixed before I even think about getting a subscription again. The app alone makes me want to toss my band and get a different kind of activity tracker, like a smart watch or something.",1
749,"I ordered these for my boyfriend and myself and have really liked everything about them. On occasion, there would be times it couldn't report on sleep the night before because of wristband positioning but that was rare.We have had them now for 10 months. Mine is still going strong and still has an incredibly long battery life. I wear it 24/7. Even in the shower. My boyfriends, however, started having issues with syncing and giving accurate readings at about the 6 month mark. It also only holds a charge for about half the time mine does.. And just last week, the entire ""face"" (the part that touches the wrist) came off. He always took his off when he was swimming or in the shower and mostly only used it at night because he has insomnia issues. I don't know if it was just bad luck and we got a defective one or if he might just be harder on his than I am but it seems to be a bit of a gamble.",5
750,"Battery dramatically declines after a month, syncing is pretty bad, and the data is meh. It will automatically record my walk to the gym and home but not the hour at the gym. It will show a slight spike till I go back and add the workout and after the activity will adjust.",2
751,"First, let me mention that I was a Fitness Specialist/Instructor in the 80s & 90s so I know when I'm exerting myself; pre-trackers. I don't know why but I get more activity points for doing light housework than I do for an intense 30+ minute workout with the Halo band. I have discussed this with Amazon on a number of occasions & they say they are looking into it. I wear my tried & true ""old"" tracker simultaneously to compare notes & the Halo shorts me an hour of sleep each night plus 2+ miles of walking each day. This part doesn't really bother me that much. The fact that I am finding I workout less & less now tho, being I don't get much credit for the effort; DOES bother me. I will say that I like the fact that it doesn't have a touchscreen, like the older tracker, so it doesn't activate when I bump it. I also like the sport band better than the fabric which seems to never be the right level of tightness. I will keep wearing, giving feedback, etc because I think the idea is sound.Addendum: My old tracker died so I had to buy another one & it's better than the Halo too; it even has a screen lock! I've packed the Halo up for a few months, hoping it will get better someday. I had 2 ""defective"" Halo bands & the third is inaccurate too... so it's the programming.In Closing: I brought it back out & it still doesn't work as well as my $35 ""temporary"" tracker that I bought to get by until the Halo got better. The Temp also has blood oxygen monitoring, call alerts, timer, stopwatch, etc, etc. AND it tracks swimming!!! [I also bought a 12-pack of bands for $13 for the Temp so I can match all my outfits now. Love it!] Obviously, I have given up on the Halo. I have officially learned that Amazon can't do everything well. I love my Echo Dots & my Fire tablet will be good again once they fix the update issue with Alexa. [LOVE Alexa!] Alexa is broken on my Android too... it is the app, not the tablet. Bottom-line, they can't all be winners & Halo is a huge failure.",1
752,"So I got this as a Day One product and I must say that this is by far my best Day One purchase. I own several smart watches; Apple Watch, Samsung watch Active 2, Fitbit Ionic. All of these have screens and I find myself using them for not much more than fitness tracking and I don’t really look at the watch itself for my progress. I just end up using the app on my phone. So, the Halo with no screen is perfect.It is so comfortable I forget I’m wearing it. The design is very subdued and does not attract any attention, which is fine for me. The app is intuitive and I feel offers a better and more accurate record of activity because  it takes away point for too much inactivity. So it helps you to maintain a good balance of activity and sedentariness.I have not tried the BMI stuff yet because I’m not ready to see the numbers. Maybe one day. LOL.The sleep tracker seems to be accurate and works well.The only issue I have with the Halo is the battery life. It gets maybe 2.5 days of use which is mediocre compared to smart watches with screens that get about the same or more.",5
753,"I was ok with the voice but could do without. I have found it drains the battery a lot faster. Steps and sleep are tracked a lot better than on my fitbit which I wore at the same time.Comfortable, easy to get on and off. Easy to navigate the app. It lasts really well too.",4
754,"I really like this band. Regarding the apparent, the device is a little bulky, not like other bands with a screen on it, so it's very easy to get used to it.  The device is really accurate, HR, sleep tracker, steps (compared to other bands that count your driving distance as walking or running) and the daily points system keeps you on track and motivates you to exercise more every week. It has multiples fitness programs and reminders, such as to close your kitchen at 7:00 pm or to drink more water every day. The program is great. The bad news is that you required a membership to take advantage of all these features. The even worse news is that the customer service regarding this HALO membership is really bad. After the free 6 months, they cancel my membership without sending an email indicating how to submit a payment or any other explaination. I tried to re-subscribe by accessing my past subscriptions on my account, and the system showed an error message every time I try to submit payment (with an activated credit card). I contacted customer service regarding this situation, request to speak with a tech representative, and they told me that they could not contact me with T.A. or someone else who could help me. That it is an ""internal escalator situation"" and I have to wait 2-3 days for someone to contact me and maybe then, they will tell me why I can not re-activate my subscription.",2
755,"Love the app, enjoy the accuracy of tracking, especially my sleep.  However, know that if you’re going to monitor tone that your battery is going to die fast.  Good news is it charges while I’m in the shower and getting around so I don’t miss out on much.  Also, hoping a newer version comes a little slimmer.  Seems a bit bulky for something that doesn’t have a face.",4
756,"I bought this specifically to track my body fat percentage more accurately. Those features of this band are great and work as advertised.I use an Apple Watch to track my workouts each day. I was very hopeful I could replace the apple watch during my workouts with this, but the band has a fatal flaw. The heart rate tracker is completely inaccurate.HEART RATE INACCURACIES:It's not uncommon for my heart rate to get between 160 and 180 BPM during the HIIT parts of my workout. I get this number accurately from my Apple Watch 3, as well as manually counting my pulse rate for 10 seconds. Unfortunately, the Amazon Halo isn't able to accurately measure my heart rate. In fact, I've had a heart rate as high as 185 on my Apple Watch, but I've never had my Amazon Halo register over 140 BPM.In my opinion, that's a fatal flaw.  The algorithm of the halo activity app relies on heart rate during workouts and throughout the day to measure your activity levels. An inaccurate heart rate renders this measurement inaccurate.I really wanted to like this band. In fact, I traded this Halo band in for the Halo view, but unfortunately it has the same heart rate inaccuracy.All things considered, I'll be keeping my halo VIEW for 3 reasons:1) I really like being able to accurately track my body fat percentage (also works on Halo band)2) I like being able to use the Halo View for my alarm to not wake my wife (Not available with Halo band)3) I like the sleep tracking features (also works on Halo band)Hope this review helps someone thinking about purchasing that appreciates being able to accurately track heart rate. I really wanted to use this during workouts to replace my Apple Watch, but now I only wear it at night.",1
757,Now malfunctioning does not connect with ww app or tone,3
758,"Update after three days of use. The halo band does not accurately track sleep. Every night it says I lay down a hour later than I actually do and says I wake up 3 1/2 hours before I actually do. This data is useless and on top of that the device itself is sometimes uncomfortable to wear. I wanted so bad to have this work and have tried with the device tighter and made sure it is 1"" above my wrist bone centered with the device on top of the wrist like a watch. I wanted an accurate picture of how much I am sleeping and this device is a waste of money in those respects.Original post: I bought this to see how well I am sleeping. Only used one night but it did NOT record data for the last 3 and a 1/2 hours of sleep. I will try again and see if it improves but not very impressed for the first try and am definitely going to consider returning it.",1
759,"I was really excited about this because I love fitness trackers and all the Echo/Amazon products except for the Echo Look (yeesh do you guys remember that disaster?) well this is shaping up to be an Echo Look Pt.2. The battery life on this is absolutely atrocious even with the update. For something that has no screen it should last much longer than 2 days. The Galaxy fitness tracker has a screen and full smart watch functionality and lasts 7 days, the FitBits even longer so that is just unacceptable. The numbers thing for fitness tracking is weird and I wish they'd count steps like all the others even if as a supplement to their numbers system. The voice thing is cool and fairly accurate but it's gimmicky and unnecessary and eats up your already short battery life. The body comp is also very cool but that is just a function of the App and the camera on your phone and has nothing to do with the Halo band itself. Speaking of the app, it is probably the one thing I like about the Halo, it is simple and sleek. The design of the band leaves some to be desired and should not be that bulky considering the little functions it has. It was not comfortable, I made it 2 weeks with this thing on for the sake of the review and hoping I could find a silver lining but I couldn't wait to get it off and it's currently sitting in a drawer. The bands feel and look cheap like someone took a piece of velcro and glued it on the tracker. Your only other option is a fitness band that looks almost as cheap. The charger takes a few attempts of clamping and unclamping before the light comes on and it starts charging, seems like it needs to be lined perfectly to connect.Overall, the marketing for this product was great but at its core it is an outdated fitness tracker comparable to the 2012 Fitbit Flex with worse battery life. I'm sorry Amazon, I love you but this seriously ain't it. This will definitely be getting returned and I look forward to a major overhaul if I am to consider it again.",1
760,"It’s a fancy pedometer, which is nice and what I wanted. I thought I wouldn’t was to check the time, but I find myself going to look at my wrist as though it’s there.The sleep monitoring is great and detailed, but it doesn’t account for naps or even if you fall asleep at 9 and wake up it the middle of the night it’ll only track from when you last fell asleep. Also, if you wake up and put in on the charger without opening the app with the information first, it forgets everything from the night.It’s good but it still involves a lot of phone checking, and the system needs work. But it’s good for a first attempt, and I appreciate the monitoring. However it also doesn’t track flights of stairs or hikes.I definitely would not pay full price for this or even the monthly fee that goes into effect soon. Even the discount earlybird price I got I believe was too much. I would value it at maybe $35-40, not the $60+ I paid, nor the $100+ it’s to be.",3
761,This product is mediocre at best. It doesn’t give the best details on the sleep. The fitness tracking is so so heart rate is cool but pretty basic I wish I gave HRV. It has some super basic workouts on here which are great for the average people. The disappointing parts are really it doesn’t work every night when I sleep every other night maybe. Every other time when I shower it it dies or just turns off and I have to reset it on the charger speaking of the charger it is maybe the hardest thing I’ve ever had to try to charge. The tone analysis is OK when it’s working just sadthe battery only last two days when using tone analysis or seven days with it off. It’s disappointing not to take it off to charge it and that’s very difficult with other bands such as the whoop you don’t have to do that. The activity points thing is weird not really sure how it works I know it gives a breakdown but it’s different. I’ll be returning this and buying a different band I was going  this one because it was cheaper monthly but as you can tell you get what you pay for. I feel Amazon can make some vast improvements such as adding HIV adding charging that you want to take this thing off better waterproofing I went swimming twice with it and both times had to charge it when I was at 75% when I started swimming.,2
762,It is annoying you have to use an app to see any info. I want a screen like with fitbit. I dont want to have to carry my phone with me everywhere just to see stats.It also can be finicky when it comes to charging. I had not used it for months and it wouldn't charge for a very long time. I thought it was broken but eventually after messing with it for a couple of hours it finally worked.I love how it shows my daily calorie expenditure and fitness points is a total motivator.The battery life is OK but if you turn on the mic it trains it fast. I dont ever have my mic on bc it is inaccurate anyway.,4
763,"I’ve had an iWatch for the last 3-4 years but wanted to switch it up and I’m glad I did. Obviously it’s sole purpose is to track your health/fitness and not make phone calls/text etc from it, which is what I like. The battery lasts for almost 5 days straight for me and I charge it for like an hour and it’s almost fully charged again (unless you have tone detection on). It’s very slim on the wrist and I usually forget I’m wearing it. The only thing I do not like about it is the ability to go into the app and select to “start” a workout you are about to do. It just auto tracks your workouts. Sometimes I will ride the Peloton and it just tracks it as “activity” and you need to go into the app and edit it to a cycle activity. Or I’ll be lifting weights and it tracks it as a walk and you have to go into the app and edit the activity. Prior to the workout you should be able to select that you are starting a run for example and after you finish, you end the run in the app. That’s something they need to add as an update.",5
764,"I love a wearable device: I have worn a Pebble, an Apple Watch, and a Fitbit (my current choice!) so I have some experience with them and generally like them.This device is such a disaster, I sent it back after about a week.  It was uncomfortable to wear (swapping out the band for a bigger size was a possibility, but a hassle.). I also hated the cloth band, which felt unsanitary to me -- really prefer a band that's easier to clean.The body scanning was kind of cool for about 15 seconds, but soon felt like a one-off novelty, and also a little creepy -- I just did not ultimately enjoy looking at the 3D model of myself, and did not ultimately trust Amazon with photos of me in my underwear.The voice tone detection is another gimmick, really poorly executed, drains the battery super fast, and the results were pretty ""meh.""  I did not find the tone detection results to be very actionable or interesting (or accurate -- it would mistake enthusiasm for grumpiness, for instance, to the extent that I could tell what it was scoring at all -- sometimes it seemed to rate my tone when I had not spoken in hours.)The battery on mine may have been defective, but it lasted way less than one day on a charge.  If a wearable has no screen and can't get through a single day on a charge -- wowzers, where is it going?When I called Amazon to cancel the recurring subscription, because I was sending the device back and did not want to be charged after the trial, no one knew what I was talking about, and it took hours and a lot of frustration -- that was easily the worst customer experience I've had in 20+ years of being an Amazon customer.All in all, I'd say if you're in the market for a wearable device, keep looking!",1
765,"Original review follows. After a very bad start, Amazon quickly replaced my Halo band. All of the issues that I had are gone. I guess that I just got a bad item the first time. Halo is a great product and is whatI expected. I still think the charger could be refined, but that is the only thing that I can give a below average grade to. I stand by my original review, but that was based on what has now been proven to be a defective item. I wanted to like this band. I did the pre-order and was happy when I got accepted. This band is good when it works. Every time, my battery dies, I have to do a factory reset in order to reconnect it. Doing so erases all of my data. Instructions are sparse and help is non-existent.  After waiting so long and having high hopes this just  did not deliver. Also, the charger is one of the worst designs that I have seen after the Fitbit Ionic. Sorry Amazon, wanted to like it but you can have it back. It just does not work consistently and I want to collect data to keep, not to lose every time the battery runs out.",5
766,"If you have another fitness tracker, you don't need the Amazon Halo. I use both an Apple Watch and the Halo, and find the watch to be much more accurate and user-friendly. The Halo doesn't have a screen, so it won't bother you with notifications, but I honestly forget I'm wearing it / never check the app.The BMI and tone recording is a nice thought in theory, but has done nothing to change my daily habits or help in my fitness journey. The BMI photos also took so long to figure out, as the app wouldn't register the correct angle of my phone.After 6 months of ownership, the sleep measurement is probably the only feature that I consistently use. It has great graphics and seems to accurately record my sleep patterns every night.My biggest gripe with the Halo is the charger. You have to position it exactly within the clamp or it won't charge, which is easier said than done. After 6 months, the Halo also stopped charging completely. I just ordered a new charger so I will see whether it is the charger or the device itself. I expected a fitness tracker and all of its accessories to last way longer than 6 months, so this is very disappointing.Overall, if you are looking for a basic fitness tracker (and don't already own one), this will get the job done. Otherwise, I think there are much better options on the market.",2
767,"I don't feel like it's extremely accurate , but I do believe it's one of the better ones. I was excited to get it, and it looks good, and is comfy to wear. Definitely worth the price.",4
768,Just got it a few days ago so I can't give a thorough review but it fits nicely and is largely unnoticable and comfortable. It's great at tracking my activity level. Sleep tracking is super accurate and really helpful for me as a chronic insomniac. I really love the bodyscan feature and provided workouts. So it's been very useful so far (48 hours). It didn't track steps on my elliptical so that's a problem. It did give me points since my heartrate was up for an hour while I used the ellipitcal though. So I guess that's what matters. I think it would be nice if it could track my steps accurately while I was on a machine though.,4
769,"So I bought the product when they had the original deal. I bought it because the tone feature sounded really cool and I wanted to try it.I loved the product it was very accurate and easy to use and understand. I didn’t like sleeping with it at first because I found it to be constricting. Anyway I have been sleeping with it since I want it to track my sleeping, and I noticed I would wake up with a red mark on my wrist.I usually charge it when i wake up and have it charging for about 1 hour, just recently I notice the back part feel off like it had burned off.I didn’t realize it was like that so I put it on and wore it like that for 2 days and ended up with a burn mark and a open sore on my wrist.I wouldn’t recommend leaving the device on the charger for long or the back will fall off. I am sad that this happened and I will be sending it back for a refund or a replacement.",3
770,"****edit**** 3/5/2022 BE AWARE. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCTIf you cancel your subscription you can not restart it.I find this absolutely disgusting.  I had to cancel my subscription for reasons I won’t list publicly.  I tried to resubscribe today and it was unavailable.  After contacting customer service, I was told you can not resubscribe after cancelling.  I asked for a reason why and received no response.  They asked for my device serial number to “escalate” my concern, and after I gave it to them told me they would forward it to the tech department to help improve the product.  So, no resolution.I am horribly dissatisfied and disappointed that I’ve invested money (and no small amount for someone like myself on a fixed income) for a product I am not allowed to use for its intended purpose.  I owned this product for less than a year and it’s of no use because I’m not allowed to pay to use it.Do better.Original Review-I really like this band.  I’ve found the sleep and activity tracker accurate.  I really like that you can put in what types of activities you were doing.  I also like that it separates it into light, moderate and heavy.  I also like the point system.  I found it motivating and it caters to my competitive side as I try to beat my points during the week.I love the programs the app offers and all the data you can review.  I’ve found the meditation and sleep programs very helpful and have seen an increase in my quality and time asleep.The body scan was really interesting.I haven’t used the tone portion.For the price I found the app and the tracker well worth it.  I loved the cloth band it came with, however the other band I’ve tried was terrible.Overall I love this product and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an activity tracker.",1
771,"Great fitness tracker! I saw some reviews claiming its impossible to reach the target score and that this device could be demotivating but I strongly disagree. I workout fairly frequently but often reach the target score within 2 or 3 days before being given a new target to keep me motivated. Even playing a round of golf (with a golf cart) I typically get around 30 points towards the 150 point target. As long as you're not sitting down all day you will recieve points and if you are sitting all day its not the fitness trackers fault for telling you the truth...The band is comfortable and without the tone feature on it lasts about a week per charge and charges full in about 30 minutesI also really like the sleep feature which tells me every morning how good my sleep was that night. So I know if I need to change any habits before bed.I havent fully explored all of the options available but the app offers a ton of different programs for fitness, sleep, and nutrition to help in any areas you want to improve. Definitely would recommend this product.",5
772,This is the first fitness tracker that I have used for longer than a day or two.  I really like that it doesn't distract me during the day but does a great job tracking.  I did not care for the voice track - I didn't think it was accurate and it just sucked the battery so I shut it off.The app has SO many great programs and challenges it is totally worth it.  My favorite thing is probably checking how much sleep I get each night.Negatives:The charger is clunky and really not sophisticated.  Not what I expected from Amazon.Took a while for me to get used to wearing it - I am not sure if i have weird bony wrists or what but I had to switch back & forth between wrsists and even wear on the underside of my wrist because it would dig in to my skin. Enough were i got a bruise.  I loosened the strap - it wasnt on very tight - maybe just was hitting a bone or someghing.  But after a few weeks I got the hang of the fit and now all is good.I wish it did Oxygen levels - that would be great.,5
773,"I wanted to love this tracker but it’s not worth the price and monthly subscription. I bought it for the 3D body composition mostly. The model looks nothing like me!! I cannot see what my specific body would look like at different fat percentages. It’s a waste. The overall app, sleep tracking, and step tracking are great. The problem is that it does not integrate with anything! Not Apple Health, Not Fitbit, Not the Peloton App, Not Google Health, nothing!! I think the only app it integrates with is Weight Watchers. I’d like to be able to Bluetooth my heart rate and steps to my favorite fitness apps.I don’t find the tone of voice tracking useful. It drains the battery a lot and I don’t find it accurate.The band itself is pretty comfortable and I like that you can swim with the tracker on. I got the pink color and it has discolored and looks gross now. Additionally it’s hard to get smells out of the band from sweating. Yuck!There’s a little light on the band that blinks every so often when it’s tracking, its bright and annoys me when trying to go to sleep.Overall Amazon has a lot of work to do. Mainly with the integration with other apps. If you are just looking for a step/heart rate/ sleep tracker then this is for you but there are probably cheaper options for that. Not worth the monthly subscription!",2
774,"Halo will shame you for working a desk job and rack up negative points. In the screenshot, I spent 4 hours doing yard work. Trimming trees, pulling weeds, leveling the ground - all in the hot summer sun. What does Halo record? 30 minutes of Intense activity. But resting in the evening earned me negative points so I ended to day with that big admonishment, just like every day.Note: Amazon reached out to me about this review. They emailed me from a no-reply email address, so my reply was undeliverable. Big LOL.Prior to getting a Halo I was using a Fitbit Alta HR for three things: Active heart rate, resting heart rate, and sleep tracking. The Halo app is so bad for active heart rate and RHR that I find myself not opening the app for a week at a time. I think it does track heart rate, but finding that info is tedious and confusing (as of Dec 2020). I cannot even speak to the accuracy of the info because I frankly do not know. The app also seems kind of pointless: No goals, no performance over time, just math and some random videos from outside sources. This app showcases the concept of ""designed by engineers"" - Yes it technically checks all the boxes, but it is terrible to use, because they didn't bring in a UX designer or get any user feedback before launching. The hardware is exceptional, truly the best wearable I have ever seen. But I am about to move back to my Fitbit just for the app. I wonder, could I link the Halo to the Fitbit app?",2
775,"Love this tracker, it is great for knowing how well I am moving throughout the day and how I’m sleeping at night.While I love it there are a couple bits that I wish were available. First, a clock. I have caught myself looking at it to check the time to realize it isn’t there.Then in the app there are the built in activity goals, it would be nice if these were more customizable to better suit my personal needs.Lastly, the battery can drain quick. With the voice recognization it drains fast and without a way to shut it fully off, I almost wish I hadn’t set it up to begin with as I’m not overly concerned with my tone all the time.That said, great band, definitely worth the cost.",4
776,"Overall... the winter is a pretty silver/blue color. It’s pretty comfortable for a band but I have small fists and the tracking plate is much larger than my wrist.  I followed the instructions for measurement and ordered a medium but I’m wondering if a small would’ve been better.Reasons for my low rating:1. Sleep Tracking: I’m a mom of 3, aged 6 and under.  You don’t have to imagine what my sleep patterns look like. The band has missed MANY periods of awake time in the night.  I’ll have been awake for over an hour with a child and it completely missed it. Then says my sleep was “great.”  Uh. No.2. The App itself is okay. The 3D body scan is neat BUT holy cow, I don’t think whatever algorithm they use was designed for women. Period. I had a comprehensive physical and body scan not even a month ago. I was told my health was great. I had a caliper done, hip to waist measurement checked... etc.  the doctor had me at 24.8% body fat. I have a scale at home that tracks body fat.  It puts me at 24.3%.  The 3D scan? 38.6%!!!I have hips thanks to 3 kids so that’s the ONLY reason I can think that “maybe” the app got so off? But even still.  For some people, such a gross error could be catastrophic to their mental health.  Do NOT let young teenage girls near this thing.  They need to seriously work on their algorithms (which they don’t disclose btw) before they come up with that math.",2
777,"I primarily purchased this fitness tracker to monitor my sleeping habits, but i have to admit, it's great for far more than that! It tracks everything that i want, but i don't have to worry about tracking calories or anything like that.For the most part, i feel that it's accurate, though there have been a few times that i've questioned whether it was able to monitor all the sleep that i got (I've woken up feeling like i got a lot more sleep than the recorded 2 hours a couple times.)I like the point system, as well as the different heartrate tiers. The app is very informative on the scoring and what goals should be, and i really like the fact that it doesn't vibrate at me or have a screen on it.The band is the most comfortable of all fitness trackers i've tried, and i appreciate that it comes in a variety of colors as well.All in all, i would highly recommend the Halo to anyone who wants to keep an eye on their health without having a device that nags you all day long. I plan to get a variety of other band colors to add to my collection as soon as i can!",5
778,"There is such an obvious target market of consumers that Amazon could quickly convert to Halo if they would have just provided similar or better statistics  Rumor even has it, that Amazon execs previoulsy met with Whoop as an acquisition target prior to developing/releasing their own device now known as ""Halo"".The Amazon Halo closely resembles the Whoop fitness tracker in its form factor and upon Halo's release, many thought that this new Amazon fitness tracking device would simply serve as a lower cost alternative.  Whoop subscribers pay $30 monthly for data analytics that includes HRV and daily recovery estimates to help determine how prepared your body is for it next workout/day. All Amazon simply needed to do was to provide similar fitness analytics and recovery information and Amazon would have easily converted the majority of the Whoop subscribers since Amazon only charges $3.99 per month for its premium monthly data package (vs $30 monthly).  Unfortunately, Amazon is attempting to shift the fitness tracking/analytical paradigm by offering some different method and metrics that as of yet, don't appear to be valued by the market. Unfortunately, I don't believe these two views have to be mutually exclusive and Amazon could have easily (and still can) provide the ""new' Amazon metrics and other information, as well as, those metrics provided by Whoop (HRV, reocery, etc.) which would have provided a win-win scenario for everyone.  As it stands now, the Halo tracker's data output and analytics provided  is substandard when compared to the common/standard metrics that are currently provided by it’s competitors Whoop, Garmin, Polar and to some extent Fitbit (new models).  Highly dissappointing.",2
779,"Update:  within 10 minutes of submitting this review Amazon called me to ask about my experience and ask if they could use some of my data to figure out what was going on. Impressive. There is hope...I am an early adopter and bought the Halo so I could test it out and compare it to the many smart watches and fitness trackers that I own and have owned.  In particular I was interested in seeing how the body scan and mood detection worked.  Overall, I have to say that I was disappointed.  On the positive side, the Halo is comfortable to wear, has acceptable battery life, and the sleep tracking is pretty good.  Unfortunately, I have found the HRM to be very inaccurate when compared with my other devices, and “credit” for activity is uneven and spotty.  For example, I seem to get outsized credit for 1-2 mile walks and not nearly enough credit for indoor activities like weigh lifting, sit-ups, using a BowFlex HVT, and riding a bike on a trainer.  I have not found either the body scan nor the mood detection to be actionable or particularly useful either.  While I am pretty disappointed at the moment, I am not writing off the device entirely.  It is possible that most if not all of these shortcomings could be fixed with firmware/software updates.  Additionally the device currently does not play with Apple Health.... if all they did was to fix that to allow the information gathered (ie sleep) to be additive to what Apple gathers with the Watch it would make it much more useful.",2
780,"First-I would never use tone. Ha! I already know I'm a loud, sarcastic NY transplant. I don't need a piece of tech telling me that.The Rest - I love that this thing isn't telling me when my phone is ringing or that I've got a message. That was getting toxic with my old band.It is great at measuring my steps and workouts. Real interesting on my sleep. Apparently many nights my sleep is awful.I haven't been brave enough to have it measured my body. I'll get there.There's a lot of bells and whistles I don't use like the sleep guides and workouts. But for someone into that I'm sure it would be good.Whatever you do, don't unpair your device! I did and it was a pain in the rumpus.Also, I use this in the water and have no problem with it. I'm in the pool for over an hour sometimes. And the band dries quickly.I'm really glad I got the Halo.",5
781,"This is my first ""personal tracking"" device outside of my phone and I love it! I haven't had it that long or dived deep into everything it has to offer.> I just found out it has a whole nutrition section..yes! <I will use that here soon, thus far I can say it's pretty Flippin awesome.Battery lasts almost a whole week before I need to recharge,Syncing is awesome, as I don't like being tethered to my phone,I have a few wrist bands, which I will upload later, that are very nice,The fact it doesn't have screen or does anything distracting is a huge plus. It's like a nice little bracelet, just not shiny..lolI have noticed initially where it sits on my wrists my skin looks a little ""different"", however my watch does the same thing so nothing alarming.I'm still playing around with it, I can't speak for fit it or Apple phone thingys...however this is simple, and perfect for me. Thanks Amazon, keep up the good work, your a better monopoly so far than walmart. 🙂",5
782,"The app is fantastic. There’s a huge selection of labs, each designed to target a specific aspect of your life. There’s also a ton of workouts from beginner to advancedMy one complaint is about the object itself.The band IMO, is fine. However the actual tracker has a sort of odd shape. It’s shaped sort of convex? So if you sit it atop your wrist the edges stick up, rather than having a subtle concave curve which would allow it to sit much more naturally on the wrist like many other fitness trackers. At first I found this to be really uncomfortable and sometimes even a little painful, but I’ve adjusted to it and hardly notice it anymore.Hopefully in future versions they focus a little more on creating a more ergonomic shape.",4
783,"The things I wanted to track seem to work nicely, however for a fitness tracker the design of the band is poor at best. The tracker fits into small rubber tabs. I have used this for only a few days now and it has called out of the band at least three times interfering with my activities forcing me to remove it. Considering that it was presumably designed for active sports minded people, I would expect it to be more secure.",2
784,"I am so excited to have my halo. Thought about fitbit versa 3 with a clock and cool gadgets but decided that's not what I need. I need something to motivate me being healthy, not help me text!Just got my halo today, so will update in a few weeks but wanted to comment on how easy, clear and a breeze set up and instructions are!! Maybe 10 minutes (with an update) and im already getting feedback on the app! Amazon is all in my house..echos etc so for me it was easy pick with halo. Hope it works soon with my home devices.. ie: my alexas tell me to move when my band senses stationery time!Very cool, and very excited!!(Stars will be updated in few weeks if needed)Update after 1 week. Still in love. Sleep tracking is so accurate! Tone is really cool. Dude that said putting on charger is difficult? Um not for me. Easy. Only charged once when was at 40%, but I turned off tone at the moment. It does what it says, and does it well. App is great. Very happy. Just need the sport band. But 25 bucks seems steep to me for just a band.",5
785,"This fitness tracker is an OK concept, but it is far too expensive for what it is. This isnt a particularly attractive device, the tracker itself is hard and bulky plastic, while the band is made out of a stiff 'seat belt' like fabric. No screen means it looks like you are just wearing a cheap  bracelet. Also, the material gives me some mysterious skin inflammation that I've never experienced with other wearables or jewelry.The function of the device is basic. You get sleep, activity, heart rate, and 'tone' which doesn't actually analyze your tone, but eavesdrops on you, listening for key-words to infer your mood (and likely purchasing habits). Sleep and heart rate works as well as any other device, but most activities you will have to track manually.The much maligned body fat analysis is what will discourage many people. Yes you are supposed to upload pics in your underwear. Yes most people will be shocked to find out how fat they are.The Labs are maybe the most disappointing feature. These are the subscription required programs that should help guide and motivate you, however there is no quality control. Some of these Labs lack audio (trying to follow a cardio workout while glued to your phone so you can see the moves change is impossible.) Some don't have any instuction at all, just ""did you do this?"" ""Short"" labs can be anywhere from 2-45 min.Overall a very average functioing device in the tracker category, but more intrusive than most, and requires a monthly subscription.*Update 2/26/22: Band has entirely stopped charging, review score dropped and subscription canceled.",2
786,"My husband got me this for my birthday and I was very excited! There are some things I don’t like about it. The voice recognition is a useless feature. It drains the battery and as a healthcare worker it violates HIPPA so I have it turned off. The other issue is that it doesn’t connect to the charger very well and I had to sit and make sure the light comes on. The other problem is that because he bought it and was approved a beta tester but gifted it to me, the program is set to his name... it’s silly but I would like to change it but can’t and that’s just a weird feature to have. Otherwise I am really enjoying it and recommend it to a lot of people!",4
787,"3.5Bought this to replace my Fitbit. I like not having a display, it’s comfortable and less intrusive than the Fitbit. I’d rather stay with the latter but they’ve been lacking in innovation.Only cons are I feel it could be slimmer, it’s a bit too high off the wrist and too thick.  The Sleep tracking is pretty useless. It only works during ‘traditional’ sleep hours and you can’t change it, doesn’t track naps, seems pretty absurd. You can’t access the fitness videos on your laptop, which means you have to look at your tiny phone making this no display device actually obtrusive. The battery is terrible. The charger is a giant plastic dongle that will surely end up in the ocean, it’s really cheap and annoying.Overall it’s okay, compared to other devices. I wanted a device I barely noticed and really don’t have to interact with almost at all. This is both there yet. It’s not very smart, and barely lives up to the concept of an unobtrusive device. It’s a first gen device hopefully gen 2 will be more refined.",3
788,"Positives:Band does not easily break (Fitbit's down fall)Encourages activities and getting heart rate upthe labs are really nice and easy to pick fromI only have to charge it once a week (not using tone)Negatives:No ability to set own goals (activity points, weight, calories, water intake ect)I wish the labs had more descriptions that you can read prior to choosing itFitbit's app is much better in customization;Halo claims to be overall fitness but it pushes more towards activity.  I'm trying to be more active to burn off post pregnancy weight but eating more than I'm burning off defeats the fitness.  Halo does not address that.I wish I could save labs for laterMy biggest complaint about Fitbit was the band breaking off even after being replaced.  However Halo does not motivate me like Fitbit did.  I'm a numbers person and Fitbit was able to congratulate me when I met my goals and that was motivating.  I was able to loose over 30lbs on Fitbit but I'm struggling with Halo.",3
789,"Overall, the halo completely missed the mark and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Amazon could have done so much better.I'll start this review with the few positives:I love the design of the onyx band, and the fact that has no screen. I bought it specifically to not be staring at and playing with a screen all day, while it continuously tracks my activity.The BMI scan is probably the best part about this product, and it seems to be pretty accurate. If you are out of shape, it might offend you.. but it is doing its job.The vocal tone is a pretty neat feature and I actually enjoy it for the most part.The sleep tracker is great, this is the main feature i was looking for as I wanted to have an idea of how much i was sleeping at night. The ability to track when you are in REM, deep sleep, light sleep, and awake is incredible.. I can look at the graph and am able to pinpoint exactly when i roll over at night, or wake up and it seems to be super accurate as well.Onto the negatives....The charger is absolutely horrible.The charger doesn't come with a brick to plug into the wall??? How are you supposed to charge it without the brick portion, luckily i had a spare iPhone brick laying around.The battery states it lasts 2-3 days, i have yet to get longer than 24 hours out of mine and i am forced into charging it every single day with the terrible charger, that routinely doesn't charge it at all.The activity / workout tracker is horrible. It forces you to go back into the app and select a time that you were working out rather then just automatically detecting a gym or workout session. The calories burned seem to be completely off...The additional features in the app like workouts, meditation, stress management for myself, are useless.Overall, wouldn't recommend until there are some serious changes made. I had much higher expectations from Amazon on this one.",1
790,"This tracker is comfortable to wear and easy to forget that it's on, but you also forget that it's on because it doesn't really track much: steps, sleep, tone of voice, that's it. It didn't do a great job of tracking my activities, so I had to retroactively enter any workouts I did. It was not comfortable to wear while working with a kettlebell. (I thought it might be since it's lower profile than other trackers) The body composition scanner is not that; it uses low quality photos and your current weight and spits out a number. Mine happened to be close to my most recent InBody scan at first, but as I put on weight (muscles) and looked more cut (I have a 6 pack) it just kept increasing my BF%. My muscle definition was not captured in the photos. It probably wasn't designed for weightlifters to track minute changes in body comp. IDK, for someone who wants a step counter, sure, but not at the price it's going for. And the subscription to me, is not worth keeping for the body comp scanner.",3
791,"Its a good product but i personally feel its bit expensive 99$, compared to other similar product which perform same functionalities are with in 40$ . In addition you have to pay for App every month or Annually (which ever you choose).Product is decent and Durable which is easy to use in daily life. Looks good on my hand and you have option to change the straps. Overall this a good product with high price tag.",2
792,"I wish I could return this halo. I love the statements and what it is supposed to do. Unfortunately it DOES NOT deliver. It doesn’t stay synced first of all. For a product like this to be a useful tool staying connected to my phone and transferring data should be seamless. If I have to take this halo off to charge , which you do every other day if you’re not using voice , it loses its connection and is unable to sync. I’ve done it all. Restart-forget the device-redo all the initial set ups. This happens ALL THE TIME. I can’t spend this much time trying to make this device work. It’s should work! I originally purchased this bc I am interested in monitoring my tone. I looooved the feature. However, it sucks the entire battery in a day. Yes you can “schedule” it but I never got the chance as it lost communication with my phone and I had to reset up the voice so many times which entails reading lines from books that when it did it AGAIN I couldn’t take the time to re set it up. The way the technology will one day be, I hope, is that you will get haptic feedback when your tone has changed in the negative. I could never remember what happened @11am when it was reported that my tone was disgusted/dismissive/ uncertain. If it would vibrate to give me feedback to check in -in the moment that would be a tool that could produce more awareness around what is going on. So for now, I have another piece of earth trash that will last longer than we ever do. Bummer. Don’t waste your money. There are tons of technology that count steps and let you know about your sleep that don’t have basic set up major issues. Tone technology isn’t here yet.",1
793,"This has a lot of potential but there are some serious issues:1) it does not track your sleep during the day. This means if you let’s say take a nap, or work the graveyard shift or—like me—-have been in a weird sleep cycle since the pandemic—-it will not track your sleep at all. Since the sleep tracking was the reason I purchased this (Apple Watch does not have as nice a break down or accuracy *when* it does work), this really just leaves a couple features which are clearly in research and design phase and we are paying to help refine—-which brings me to my second issue.2) the feature that captures phrases of positive or negative “tones” is a little bit scary. I can see why most people will not like this feature—similar to finding out you are adopted—it shows you both the good and bad times. Also, if you’re playing a game or watching tv —I don’t think it should track it as your “state”/“mood” or at least should help differentiate the sounds. It would be helpful if they had an option of knowing what you said so you can learn/compare notes and improve (which is what I’m guessing this tool is exactly meant to do/helpWith) because it does have a VERY long lag to sync/update and by the time it populates in the app, I have totally forgotten what I was doing or who I was with. This can be better.3) finally, just brief notes here as I’ve only had the tracker for a few weeks—-the band is AWFUL. Within the first 12 hours it collected any and all lint  from sweaters, towels, etc. It literally went from pink to black so I threw it in the washer on day 1! (Can you imagine having to wash this everyday?) I did research and find a black non-fabric band that you can buy separately but it isn’t due to arrive until July! I wish they either gave us an option or got rid of the fabric band altogether.Other than that, I think the app gives good feedback that can be helpful if you’re trying to improve sleep, self-awareness and health.",1
794,"I bought this as what I hoped would be an upgrade for my 2 year old Fitbit Charge 3.  Alas, not so.  At least for exercise & sleep tracking Halo has potential but it's not there yet.  I suspect, but don't know for sure, that the app is not making the best use of the data the device is providing.  For example, the app matches my Fitbit in calculating the quality/type of my sleep during the night, but doesn't seem to record a refreshing nap taken during the day.  My Fitbit does this admirably.  Also, unlike Fitbit, the Halo doesn't make it easy to see the data for an individual exercise session and recognize its type (e.g., biking vs. swimming) while providing a straightforward calorie count for that sessions.  Rather the interface bundles the data together in a ""point"" system that makes it hard to extract what benefit you got from a given session.  Overall, a miss by Amazon.  I've returned the Halo and will likely keep my Charge 3 for another year.",3
795,The mobile app is easy to use and seems to be pretty accurate.,3
796,Light weight and comfortable to use. Battery lasts up to a week if you don't use the tone feature. Awesome overall. The only reason to remove 1 star was charging experience . You need to improve the charger - make it magnetic so the device clips into perfect spot quickly. It needs aligning every time i put it in the charger.,4
797,"I was so excited about this device, and I’ve been an early adopter since Oct. I’m moderately active and have used Fitbit for my regular wellness tracking and Apple Watch for my workouts.I like the Fitbit app, the data and analytics available to users and the variety of devices in their line up - however I’ve found the devices themselves to be fragile and prone to needing replacement constantly. And their customer service is nonexistentMy Apple watch is great for workout tracking but is too clunky to wear 24/7 for other wellness tracking, and isn’t ideal for things like steps, overall calories burned, etcSo I was THRILLED to have another option, and I’m a long time Amazon device devotee.The app is a good start, I love the idea of a lineup of prescriptive wellness labs for everything from workouts to calming exercises and binaural beats. However, the data accuracy of this device renders everything else about it COMPLETELY unusable. It’s all over the place with readings on every data category. I could have a full blown meltdown screaming match one day and be totally silent the next, my tone would register the same. I could sleep like a baby for 8hrs uninterrupted according to Fitbit one night and halo would register 8 sedentary hours and dock my activity score. The activity score is an attempt at something more dynamic than steps but the sedentary hour subtractions are frustrating (even when they’re right) and demotivating - it’s not ‘standing hours’ like you might think - the device tracks EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY that you are sitting, and combines them for a total sedentary time. Work 8 hours but get up every hour at the :30 for a 10 min walk? You might call that 8 moving hours, halo calls it 6hrs40m sedentary. Better not sit again all day or you’ll lose pointsAnd worst of all, the workout tracking- I run 1hr50min 5 days/wk for years. I’m extremely consistent, it’s almost the same run every single day. But don’t tell halo that - my 12.5miles my Apple Watch is tracking? The same workout on the same wrist, halo says I logged 2,000ish steps. Barely 1 mile",1
798,"I've worn this for almost 6 months now. I like it, but decided to buy a Fitbit on prime day, and I doubt I'll go back to the Halo. I originally liked the idea of no screen., but after wearing it a for few days I realized that if I'm going to have something strapped to my wrist, I should at least be able to look at the time.  I don't need to receive text messages or phone calls on it, but the date and time would be nice. I never bothered to use the voice tone feature, not what I want out of this type of device. The body scan thing is cool, did it once, but it really has nothing to do with the band, it is done with your phone and the app. I like the sleep tracking, and I like the exercise point system. It has some good features, but it is really ""too"" dumbed down.",3
799,"Device monitoring is unreliable for sleep tracking and voice monitoring.  Ok on steps and activity.  Does not connect with anything but some John Hancock program and weight watchers.  Worst amazon product I have every purchased.  Get a Fitbit or  Garmin.  The halo device and service  is utterly useless. Sleep function either does not record or will only  record a few hours.  Tone is unreliable based on feedback of device compared with feedback from individuals involved I the conversation.  Battery charge will last about 30 hours on average.  You can get better features from other apps like aaptiv that the content Amazon is charging $4.95 a month.  Waste of money and time.  Update:  Amazon called me about my halo band review.  The person  who called, J.j. demanded my full name but would not provide his full name.  I told him that I will not proceed with a conversation when the company arrogantly assumes I must provide detailed information but they are not obligated to provide any information at all, then the same person JJ sends an email telling me that he "" tried to reach you over the phone, but unfortunately we didn't connect"", which is a lie.  Like their attempt at making a phone, Amazon should fail early with the Halo band and move on to something at which they can succeed.  This effort is doomed to be a perennial laggard in the fitness tracking marketplace.. You can tell a popular product on Amazon by the ""have one to sell feature"", i.e. a secondary market for the product.  Note that the Halo band does not have this, Amazon is having a hard enough time selling these the first  time to unwitting customers. Don’t be misled by amazon ratings, especially about their own products.  They selectively choose ratings to include in their averages, so the real average review rating for halo is probably much lower than they show.",1
800,"I wanted something without a screen so i wasnt constantly checking it. I find this to be very motivating and helpful. I find the one downside is the charger, wich is not user friendly and very difficult to get to set and stay set up to charge. I actually had the charger give out on me and had to get a replacement. Otherwise i would score this much higher. On a side note I've tried several other brands and bands and none lasted long and their customer service was difficult and often nasty. Its nice that my halo band comes with great support too.",4
801,"Mood Detection:  4/5I was initially impressed with the mood detection feature, and made me cognizant of how I talk to others. However using this feature drains battery life. I literally have to charge the band every 2 days.Heart Monitoring: 2/5It is not continuously monitored and only when you open the app and go to the relevant tab, which is a bummer.Sleep Tracking: 3/5Tracks REM and light/deep sleep well, however once awake it seems to track that in total sleep as well which is not accurate.Activity points: 2/5Just like circles on Apple watch, there is similar point program on this device. However it penalize points for being sedentary. It is not practical to be active throughout the day, and hence feels like demotivation with the points strategy on this device.Membership Price: 2/5Given the premium features like body composition, mood detection is only via halo subscription (free for 6 months initially) that goes at $3.99 / month, basic features on the device seem very limited for $99 device price.Health Data Storage: 2/5Data is stored only on the halo app and does not sync with Health app on the iOS device, which generally all other wearable devices do so.Overall:  2/5This device is innovative and has interesting features like mood detection, however with poor battery life, lack of syncing data to iOS device, no continuous heart monitoring, penalized point system, and incorrect awake time tracking in overall sleep, I ended up returning the device as it does not justify the initial price and the membership prices.",2
802,"Truly a deep app and for the value top tier, but the sleep tracking is oddly off it feels like. On nights where I sleep like an absolute poo bag I'm getting decent sleep sometimes, on night where I sleep well I'm reported to have lots of disturbances. Could use some work there.",5
803,"I was excited to receive the product and put it straight to use. I also have an apple watch and liked to wear both since I didn't sleep with my watch on.The mic stopped working 3 months after receiving the product. It also began to have syncing issues. I contacted Amazon support, it took alot of transferring to get me with someone that could assist me and they didn't seem familiar with the product. I explained I had reset, repaired, and verified no updates. They proceeded to replace the item. The soonest they could have it to me was about 2 weeks, I was fine with this. Then it was never delivered, I went and checked and the date had moved another 2 weeks, okay I will wait. Again never showed, all of a sudden I received and email asking if I still wanted the item because August was the new estimated date. I chose to contact Amazon again and ask for a return/refund for the device as well has a return/refund for the two $20 bands I purchased. Again alot of transferring, finally someone sent me the prepaid labels. I sent everything back the next day and it was received on the 18th. They still charged me the last device payment on the 24th even though they had them back and I am still waiting on my refund, now they say by the 1st. So we shall. I cannot suggest the product which is disappointing because I really did like it,.",2
804,"Tried this Halo in a give away from Amazon. I was excited for a more slim tracker and the features. I'm not into wearing a tracker while sleeping or having it listen to my private conversations. It's nice that the voice recognition feature is an option you choose to turn on or off.  I did like the fabric with the velcro feature, but found the fabric on the band does start to pill after a while.  I've tried a few different fitbits before and wish the app had more features like tracking flights of stairs.  It's a nice basic tracker with other bells and whistles. Just not sure it was for me. I wish the app was more user friendly, seemed like I had to mess around with how to use it. The charging device is nice, but you have to be sure the dots are lined up on the clip, otherwise it won't charge. Charging was really fast, which was nice. Thank you for the opportunity to try this product for free!",3
805,"I really wanted to give this item 5 stars but it has missed the bar when it come down to the voice recognition. To some that may not be important but it is to me. I want to know if I'm being pleasant and so forth. Basically, we as humans can feel as though we are one way but could come off to other another. The halo at times does not track for days. Amazon did send a replacement watch that for a few days was doing the same thing but is ok for now.It's excellent and above and beyond when tracking everything else. Would I recommend this tracker even though I gave it 3 stars! I would...",3
806,"Overall it's  decent tracker. I had some trouble syncing it initially,  and ended up having to do a factory reset. Once activated it seems to work well. It tracks steps and can tell when you've done exercises. You get points for activities and meeting daily goals which gives you some motivation to be active. The sleep tracker seems pretty accurate, and gives you a score based on your sleep. I'm not sure how it can tell, but it tracks REM, light and deep sleep. I have not tried the ""tone"" tracker or the body fat scan. I dont feel the need to do either, mostly because I don't care much about those aspects. I'm also a little skeptical about the privacy policy because I haven't read it in full. My only gripes with it are the slim selection and price of the bands. A replacement band is 1/3 the price of the device which I find ridiculous. I also wish there was a time display, but thats not as big of a deal.",3
807,Don’t like the sleep tracking..not truly accurate,3
808,"I've had this a few months. A few things to note.1. It will occasionally lose connection to your app. This means having to delete it from your Bluetooth, reset the band (lose all data stored), login and reauthenticate to the app (twice, once for Amazon and once for the Halo app; and yes all while launching the app). Then re-pairing it to the app, which requires putting it in it's charger with it's ridiculously short cord), and pushing the control button twice, hold the second push and waiting for blinking purple light which may or may not be covered by your thumb.2. The Tone feature is useless. It interpreted me as having fear and anger in a day that I found quite relaxing, most every day. Useless, unless you want to change your vocal style to a Disney character.3. No web app (like Fitbit). Charts and graphs have to be viewed on your phone or tablet, with no ability to zoom or get further detail.4. Basically a heart rate and step monitor is all it is once your Halo subscription runs out. Amazon's wrist brick. It doesn't appear they're furthering the app development or have plans for a site to delve further into your data.Get a Versa for Thirty-five bucks.EDIT - Amazon did call me and made things right. Check future reviews to see if this is still made or if they come out with a 2.0 version that fixes the device and app.",2
809,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Lots of persons are reveiwing this product and giving it a bad image but I want to make this clear to everyone who has it and everyone who is planning on getting it.  IIT'S FOR GETTING YOU IN SHAPE. ITS FOR BRINGING OUT THE BEST IN YOU. NOTHIBG MORE, NOTHING LESS. This device will not pretty up anything for you when it comes on to your body, its gives you a straight and accurate answer Base on the measurements you have inputted. It is suppose to let you see why you are unfit and encourage you to get back to the best of you. So, if you dont want to put in the work, dont buy this product, if you are not 100% committed then dont buy this product, if you are gonna complain about this product being insensitive then  dont buy the product. STOP TELL PEOPLE THAT THE PRODUCT IS BAF JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT COMMITTED ENOUGH. It has soo many features such a sleep tarcking, voice recognition, heart rate and BMI. Im in love with it. And I havent reach my best yet but im committed because i have seen the progress i have made with this product.... soo thank you Amazon",5
810,"The band fits comfortably and worked well for  about a month, but not bad enough to merit a return. Eventually it started to consistently need to be reset and synced manually. Heart beat worked well, so I thought, until I realized that any heart beat above 100 would be pushed down below the 100 mark as the day progressed, eventually leaving only the highest heart beat of the day over the 100 mark. So unless you consistently checked high heart rate throughout the day and recorded it separately, it looked like the heart rate never went to where you would have wanted it to for a heart-healthy workout. Unfortunately this was realized too late to return.Sleep monitoring was good and accurate (so I assume). Voice monitoring was great in theory, but no notifications provided in real-time to help you know how your emotions were coming across. So unless you remember the conversation you had at what time of day, or monitored it live, you would have no way of knowing why emotions were recorded as such, not allowing you to improve upon yourself.Overall, I wish I could return it and wish I would have realized the flaws within the return window. It would have been nice for amazon to have made system updates, but none have been seen in my 7 months of use. I will need to be on the lookout for a better monitor.",2
811,"I have had this for about 5-6 weeks now.  I was hesitant because I already have a smart watch.  I do like the sleep tracker better as I am not comfortable wearing my watch and my watch needs more frequent charging.  The Halo holds it's charge for several days.  I was very hesitant to use the body scan, but ultimately that is the feature that has made me decide to keep the device.  It measures body fat and seems fairly accurate.  I think it is a helpful way to monitor progress, more than just weight on the scale.  I wish it would sync with other devices and/or nutrition apps, but for the price, it is decent.  The band is comfortable to wear too.",4
812,"This band has a lot of cool features, it's just that they never seem to work correctly. How have I been sedentary for over 3 hours if I have only been awake for 20 minutes? This data is tracked in the app, it knows how long I've been asleep and when I woke up and yet it still docks the points as if it has no idea what it's actually doing. Speaking of the app, it crashes regularly which makes it a nightmare to deal with. I love the activity tracking, checking my heart rate along with the category of activity is great but that alone doesn't make it worth the price. The BMI feature is interesting, and more accurate than you'd get with just a scale, but it's still obviously flawed as well. I would try out the tone of voice feature, even though the idea of having an amazon linked product listen to my every word all day gives me severe anxiety, but it drains the battery on the device rapidly. If you're not using all of the features, just the default ones, you're looking to have a decently long charge which is a nice bonus since I am sure it thinks you're sedentary if it's charging, docking you points. This thing is so close to being a real gem, and with some minor tweaking I am sure it could be amazing, but the shortcomings compounded have me regretting my purchase.",2
813,"I was excited to try out the new Halo fitness tracker, only to find that I Hate it. I haven't had a fitness tracker in a long time and decided to get back into tracking. I workout religiously 5 days a week. If you're a weight lifter, this band is Not for you. This band doesn't track this type of exercise, and if it does, you're UX needs some serious work. Since the band doesn't recognize weight lifting, you have to manually log it in as an exercise in order to keep track of your exercise days.'Tone' feature: I thought it would just be fun to test it out. BUT it logs times of your tone, and if you go back to see what made you so happy, you wont get to know. It's pointless to know what time I felt an emotion and it doesn't do me any good if you don't even tell me what the phrase or word was!Sleep log: I found myself using my Halo more to see my sleep patterns than anything else. However, even this feature doesn't compare to Fitbit as there are fewer insights recorded with Halo.Active Points: The Halo never had me reaching my 150 weekly Active Points, which is just ridiculous and demotivating. So, I recently switched over to the new Fitbit Luxe as it's overall smaller, has small screen and fits my small wrists nicely. I didn't realize how inaccurate the Halo was until I started using the Fitbit. I have close to 400 Active Points logging in my Fitbit per week.Step Tracking: I did find that the Halo does seem to accurately track your steps. Hence, the one star rating.Overall, Halo needs to seriously step up their game if they want to make it in the Fitness Tracking business. If you just walk around and sleep, then maybe you'd like this tracker - otherwise, stick with the pros in the business for now.",1
814,"As a 5+ year FitBit user, switching to halo was not easy. The missing clock face forced me to put my watch on the right hand. As an habit, I have been hitting the top of halo the same way I used to for Fitbit. My halo failed charging for the first 45 minutes or so. I had to move it around to make sure the teeth’s align for charging.Liked it’s body fat calculator and voice analyzer, which was amiss in Fitbit.The heart beat monitor is something that I am still confused about, my Fitbit shows 5 less than halo on a consistent basis. However, not a major thing to worry about.Regarding the band, its light and gentle on the skin. Have not done extreme workouts, coz of holidays, for it to go sweaty to feel the real sensation of the band during workouts. Another drawback, you cannot change the band, and are stuck with the band you chose when you buy it, unlike Fitbit.Liked the App though. Will review the App on AppStore.",3
815,"I like to wear a traditional watch, but I also wanted something to track my fitness and sleep activity. This is a great, unobtrusive, device that does just that. And it has fun features like the body scan and tone analyzer to check your progress and keep track of how you come across to others. Reaching the suggested daily and weekly activity levels is not hard and provides great insight into improvements that can be made. In sum, the Halo band is a great way to track your daily fitness and activities.",5
816,"I like this for some features but overall not impressed. I wanted this because it was simple while still having a good amount to offer on the app. I like the live heart rate monitor. It helps when the machines won't pick up my heart rate at the gym or I don't want to hold the heart rate handles but I want to know what it us. I just prop it on the machine and go, although sometimes the moderate to intense activity recording isn't accurate. I like the body scan feature. It helps me see differences as I go through my workout process...like progress pics. It's nice that the classes are there but I don't really use them. Pretty sure the sleep is not accurate. The tone feature was cool at first but then just ended up being turned off to save on battery. The syncing sucks...there's no better way to say it. When I got a new phone it took me 3 days to finally get this thing to reconnect. Last but not least....the band. I literally measured my arm and everything because I wanted to make sure I got the size just right. I have an imprint on my arm sometimes because I have to tighten this thing so tight to 1:get it to read and 2:to get it to stay put on my arm. I really had higher hopes for this. I was really excited to try it...now I'm kind of disappointed.",2
817,"I think the Halo has a lot of cool features. The voice recognition, body scans, sleep tracker. It’s sleek and light weight. I have always used a fit bit and not sure why but this bracelet has been hard to get used to wearing 24/7. I don’t like a right fit but for it to be accurate it suggests a snug fit. I have to leave it loosened to wear it. I love it don’t get me wrong but feel like the Fitbit designs are more comfortable and I hate not having a clock on the halo. I loved the convenience of checking the time on my Fitbit. All in all I do love the Halo and it’s features. Just wished it had a clock on it.",4
818,"I really like the the Halo but the band gets dirty and I haven’t been able to find a way to order another one. I do like that it comes off so I can wash it. Another thing that’s a little annoying is that, even when I take forever to fall asleep, it will say it only took a few minutes. That part isn’t very accurate. Also the app can be clunky and not easy to navigate. Overall an enjoyable experience.",4
819,"I have a Fitbit and an Apple watch. I love the Halo. It is comfortable to wear. I have both types of bands. I prefer the one that is not fabric. I feel like it catches on my clothes less. I got Halo for the tone feature. It has been fun to see what it says. I think it is fairly accurate on my tone. I also like the labs. There are a lot to choose from that take varying lengths of time. I also like that you can set reminders so you can do your lab. I find that the movement goal on Halo is more interesting than the daily movement goal on the Apple watch. You have to get to 130 for the week, but if you sit too long it will start subtracting points. The sleep function is fine. One day it logged me sleeping for longer than I was. I couldn't find a way to change that like you can in some sleep apps. The body scan feature seems to work fine as well. It also charges pretty quickly. Overall I am enjoying it. I have had it for about a month now and have worn it every day and night.",5
820,"The product really is good for what it is. It doesn't distract the user from its intended purpose. I do enjoy seeing my sleep patterns but I can't really say that I care too much for the other features b/c I prefer not to be too bogged up in the everyday little things. But its not a bad purchase at all, especially when on sale.",4
821,"I am just all around underwhelmed by this device. The first Fitbit I ever got, easily a decade ago, was a simple silicon band without a screen and it was a much better device than this.The plastic tracking bit is clunky and has to be strapped on tight in order for the weight of the piece to not pull the fabric band around all day. Additionally, they only offer fabric bands which is a weird choice since it absorbs water when you wash your hands, etc and then stays damp and uncomfortable, sometimes for hours.The tone tracking is just not that interesting to me and frankly I don't think it works especially well either.The activity tracker cannot possibly be anywhere near accurate. It never counts my daily yoga classes but will register random half hours of high activity at times of day that I know I was sedentary. I always far surpass the recommended number of seemingly arbitrary activity ""points"" I'm supposed to get. Which does not make sense either, since I've been living in a studio apartment, out of work, and going to school online. I am more sedentary than ever before.Currently it won't sync with the app and I am trying to troubleshoot it but I am not sure why, since I don't like it or really want to wear it anymore anyway.In fact I'm assuming these are ""currently unavailable"" because Amazon didn't anticipate this deluge of negative reviews.",2
822,I’ll return to get one that had a time on it,3
823,"I really want to like Halo and I keep trying, but the app and battery life (or lack thereof) seem to be conspiring against me. Simply and crudely put, the battery life sucks. But - the app, which during the free trial worked great - now shuts itself down within a minute when I try to access my info. I had a Fitbit before and thought the Halo would be as good or better, but I am getting a hard lesson in “You get what you pay for”  Why pay for an app that  I can’t access for more than a minute before it shuts down? I have had my Halo for just over a year and while I hate to break up with it because of how much I wanted to love it - I am tired of the frustrations. I will give it the rest of this week, but if the app issue remains, I will go back to Fitbit.",3
824,"I got the Fitbit Active 4, and a couple months after I got this ""Amazon Halo"" thingy, so I had the chance to try and compare both of them.These are my main observations:The Fitbit has a screen, can display the time, your heart rate, and notifications. (I love this)The Fitbit has a vibration motor that can remind you to take a quick walk. (this is the most important feature to me)The Halo battery seems to be half the size of the fitbit or something, because it drains much faster.The features that both bands do share seem to be about as good vs each other.The only way I could possibly recommend the Halo is if you wanted the ""voice tone"" feature really badly, but I've never even tried it, and apparently it drains the battery even faster.Considering the Fitbit Inspire is cheaper than the halo, and has all the features I like from my Active 4, I would say to just go with that.The only saving grace of this would be if they managed to put a much larger battery in it so you only had to charge it like once a month or something, but I had to charge this much more than my fitbit, so uh, no. (I had to charge it about once a week, not bad, but my fitbit was always about 20-30% more charged)I guess it does look pretty simple and understated if you're into that, but the fitbit doesn't exactly stand out in comparison, so, meh.",2
825,"I actually love this band! My only complaint is that I wish there was a way to track food/water within the app. If there is I haven’t found it yet. Overall, I originally purchased for the BMI scale built in, but, I actually really love the sleep analytics it offers. I’ve never tried whoop or Fitbit but I do have an Apple Watch and I definitely like the halo more for understanding sleep and fitness. It offers a lot of programs for the first 6 months and I’m trying to use them as much as I can to see what I like and don’t like. So far so good! Just wish I could easily check off for water or get points for water and write in my food.",4
826,"Heart rate monitor seems accurate, however a high heart rate is always confused for activity even if your not doing anything, the sleep tracking has semi frequent errors where it will log you woke up an hour or even 2 before you actually woke up, the tone tracking seemed very inaccurate  and would quarter the battery life of the product, the app makes it difficult to find useful features like graphs of your heart rate through out the day, i do like the simplicity of the band, no screen, no time, just a fabric band with a bump, i mainly got this for heart and sleep tracking, and i never use the tone tracking because of how much it affects battery life, the apps bmi measuremt seems to over estimate as well",4
827,"If you’re looking for a band that is basically like your Apple, Garmin, fitbit, whatever this band is not it. It’s not going to give you time or text messages. That’s exactly what I knew I was getting and I really like it. It’s a simple tracker but it’s so complex. It monitors your heart rate, your physical exertions. It’s helped my keep an eye on my sedentary activity and sleep habits. It really breaks everything down for you. I do not use the tone feature. I’ve read where it can really run down your battery and without it I only have to charge my band once a week. The body composition feature is probably my favorite part. Gives you a pretty accurate reading on your BMI and shows you your compositions front and back. The only thing I wish it did was showed you a profile but that’s pretty minor.If I were to request just one thing, I would ask for a built in alarm since it analyzes your sleep. Other than that I think it’s a great band that’s a little more comprehensive in health without being like a smart watch.",5
828,"This is my second one. To Amazon's credit they did replace it though it was past the date to do so. However, I didn't realize at the time Amazon gave me LESS than a month to return it. I've NEVER seen a return on Amazon with such a small window. Especially considering it is their OWN product. That should be the first red flag. This thing just doesn't work. I so wanted to love it. It's the bane of my existence. The is an entire forum on reddit dedicated to all the problems this thing has. First. It's not accurate. Not at all. The steps, the heart rate the sleep, the fat percentage. None of it. The sleep numbers will literally change on you as the day goes on, and the fat percentage? Do it twice in a row see how much fat you gain/lose in 2 minutes. But now it won't even stay synced. Not at all. It's so enraging. More frustrating is customer service. They act like you're stupid. They all say the same thing, oh it needs updated. NO IT DOESN'T! I update it every time one is available. I have done everything customer service service says and they repeate the same things do this do that. The problem is amazon not me. As I previously stated there is an entire forum on reddit about this, this problem is not unique to me. What I do find interesting is some people are being given an extra free 6 months on their trial and others like me are not. Considering none of it is working it hardly seems fair to charge for this. I will most definitely be cancelling when my trial is up. The tone doesn't record unless you physically go into live and record, then after that it will catch up. I have to double press the button every single time I want it to work. And oh yeah it does not sync with WW which was the whole reason I bought it. I've gained 10 pounds since I bought this thing because not only can I not see my damn stats but it's so demotivating.",1
829,I was really excited to get the Halo. It was a total disappointment and I only used it for a few weeks before just tossing it in a drawer and going back to FitBit.The battery drains so quickly when you have Tone analysis on that you have to charge it every single day.The app is monstrously slow and takes forever to update every time you open it.The sleep analysis is not as good as FitBit.Accessing past data isn’t intuitive and despite using it for several weeks I never did figure out how to or whether I could compare month to month or week to week except to manually go through and look. I also was never able to figure out if there was a way to look at a longer time span than “this month” on the main chart. I’m guessing not and that’s a total waste. Progress should be visible in whatever timeframe I choose.The body scan is also off and marks my body as a shape that it isn’t and also guesses my body fat extremely high; even my doctor is baffled by the assessment.The other thing is that it’s really distracting; they say that they created it to be less distracting by not having it be a watch but the little syncing and measuring lights flicker constantly! That’s way more distracting than any watch ever was.It’s really too bad because I was hoping that this would be an awesome product.,2
830,"I always had trouble synchronizing the sleep tracking data with the app, it lags and is slow. I purchased it thinking that it would replace a regular watch, but soon realized - why would I be carrying something on my wrist that doesn't have a screen on? Furthermore, I also purchased the Halo View, but I am also unsatisfied with it especially because of the trouble synchronizing and because of the size of the watch, its size seems to be made for small people. It seems to be a feminine watch for its size, I always felt uncomfortable using it - I'm used to wearing something that has a size that matches my body and arm size. The advertised pictures give the impression that it's bigger than what it really is, which creates some frustration. So both the Halo band and the Halo view became useless to me when I realized that buying an Apple Watch provides everything and looks much better on your wrist. It's definitely worth the higher price paid for it. Also, it is ridiculous that the Halo band and Halo view still charge an incredibly high price for the band. The band prices are almost 50% of the device's price. The band prices are so high that always limited me from trying a different one. I wish I could return both Halos I have, but it's been a bit long and I guess it will have to stay in the drawer for the rest of its time.",1
831,"I am really enjoying my Halo. I knew my job was really interfering in my weight loss and the Halo proves it. I sit for 9-15 hours a day at a pretty stressful job. The Halo gives me point for my workouts and taketh them away for sitting. It was pretty eye opening. I do wish the bands were not so expensive or I would have several and I wish you could run the app on several things at once....like my phone and my tablet.I did get a special promo by being on Weight Watchers (see, I'm really trying), but I had been waiting for this to come out because I can swim in it.Halo, keep up the good work.",4
832,I read a lot of reviews before purchasing and didn't expect to be perfect but decided to pick it up on prime day. It has surpassed my expectations. I really like it. I was not interested in the sleep monitoring until I used it and it has been very informative.  I purchased for the tone feature. It is ok I need to use it more. Everything else is great too. I like there is not a distracting screen as well.,5
833,"I really love the Halo so far. I’ve been wearing for about two weeks and it literally does so much. You can focus on specific things like sleep or mood, or weight, or food. There are several features I still have to try but so far I think it’s one of the best smart fitness trackers I’ve ever used.",5
834,"My first tracker. I've had almost 1 year now. I feel like it's been pretty good but could use improvements. The battery used to last almost a week and now I'm down to less than 24 hours and I've never used the tone feature. A replaceable battery would be nice. The sleep tracker is nice the only issue I have is that the time to fall asleep is completely inaccurate. Also, I can't confirm but as stated in other reviews, I believe the heart rate monitor is off a little when doing intense workouts. I got this when it first came out so I got a pretty good deal on it and I'm planning on getting the halo view next. I like the zero distraction on a regular basis however, while working out it'll be nice to have a display.",3
835,"If you want a device to track your sleep, don't use the Halo!! I've had it for over a year now and have used it for weeks at a time but never get reasonable results. Example, last night I went to bed at 9:30.  I slept okay till 11:30 then tossed and turned for a bit. I was awakened around 2:30ish and got out of bed for about 3 minutes. I fell back asleep reasonably well. I feel like I tossed and turned a bit all night and I know I have sleep apnea so that probably affects my sleep a lot. That's why I have the Halo, to know how my sleep is being affected. This morning I checked my app and it says that I didn't even go to bed until 2:39am. Many other times I've had it show me that I went to bed at 9:30, but was awake for an hour and a half in the middle of the night. If I was actually awake for that long, I would certainly know. I used a Fitbit for years and it gave very different results. Results that I found to be very consistent with the way my sleep experience felt for the night. If this thing is so bad at knowing when I fall asleep, how good could it be at measuring other functions. VERY disappointed. As a sleep tracker, it's worthless.",2
836,"So here’s my review on the Halo fitness tracker released 2 weeks ago. Been wearing it regularly. It sells for $100 and $3.99/mo subscription fee.  It tracks your body composition telling you how much mass mass you have and displays an eerie accurate animation of your body scan.  It doesn’t count steps but actual “activity” & you lose points if your still too long. The sleep tracker is spot on and I’ve learned I really don’t get enough sleep!  The other feature that is cool yet borderline freaky is it interprets your tone of voice and categorizes it. And it’s CRAZY accurate.I guess it’s ok, it delivers what it promises. It’s definitely the less expensive option to be so accurate. I’ll put some screen shots in comments.",4
837,"I’ve been using my Halo band for some time, my initial POV:-No Screen - I really prefer this as I’m not constantly checking it nor having lights go off all the time. It also doesn’t look I have a gadget on my wrist.-Sleep Tracking - Seems quite accurate imo. I like seeing Fair vs Good vs Great as I know what I’m going to feel like the rest of the day. I have noticed sleep improvement as well when I made some changes (less late snacks, effect of taking melatonin etc). Pretty fascinating stuff.-Activity - it took time for me to adapt to the scoring but I really love this and find it easier to follow now. I like being able to see step averages by week for comparison and also the negative sedentary point are cool. I’ve found myself walking way more on a daily basis as well.-Tone - I enjoy this feature and find it to be accurate. Interesting to see it pick up when I’m having a bad day vs a good day. Has made me more self aware for sure.-Comfort - I find this band to be way more comfortable than others I’ve tried. Soft and very flexible.",5
838,"I love the battery life. And I love the halo app! It’s so great! I have used Apple Watches in the past and they are great except they have an awful battery life. I charge Halo band every 6 days, and it takes only an hour or two! So fast!However, I hate that it isn’t compatible with any calorie tracker apps. And they don’t offer that option on their app. If it was compatible with any free calorie trackers or had the option to track in the Halo app I would say that it was the best fitness tracker out there. But Fitbit beats it.",4
839,"I’ve been using my Apple Watch series 4 for a while now and although I didn’t necessarily replace it with the band, I find that using them both simultaneously has been equivalent to the newest line up of smart watch’s. I have also not seen the tone tracking tech in another watch and doing live feedback is super helpful for speeches or just practicing.",5
840,"If you're thinking about buying the new Halo band from Amazon - DON'T.  I bought one in my quest to be healthy.  Turns out it really only has two features.It has a ""feature"" (take note of my sarcastic quotes please) that measures your tone throughout the day.  I don't think I needed a $100 bracelet to tell me I'm a jerk.  😠Oh, and let me tell about the body scan ""feature"" - it scans pictures of you, then turns you into a robot...so you can see how fat you really are, robot style.  And then meaures your level of fatness on a grid.  Thank you Amazon.  I wasn't aware that I was the fattest robot on the planet,  but I am thankful that you clued me in. 🤦‍♀️If anyone needs me I'll be over here pretending to laugh to trick my Halo Band that I'm a nice person, and eating lettuce to prepare for my next robot scan.  😐🥬",3
841,"I mainly bought this for the body composition analysis however the body composition analysis did not work on me I'm no way obese or have a greater than 50% BMI but every single time I've tried it did not work on me but if I tried it on my dad or sister at the same place with the same lighting and everything, it worked on them so I would not be keeping this. For reference, I am 5'2"" and weigh 138lbs I really like the no screen feature, however it did become annoying when I constantly wanted to look for the time and I had to wear two ""watches"" at once so that was really annoying; other than that I really like the device and how simple the style is.the app itself is something that you have to get used to- there's a lot on there but you have to get used to how the way that Amazon set it up. It was not hard or difficult to manage in any way",3
842,I like it,5
843,"I absolutly LOVE the app and tracking features of this band. The battery life, it sucks. The looks, they suck.Battery LifeI can't wear this during the day and at night because the battery will wear out. The voice recognition is super cool but running it means the battery will MAYBE last the work day.Comfort & LooksIt isn't comfortable. It sticks up kinda high, which would be fine it was also a watch. But it isn't. I have small wrists and it just looks funny on me. It also is very casual. It will not cut it in a work environment. It looks cheap for business attire. But for sports it is really great. The problem is it is WAY more than a pedometer and heart rate monitor.ReliabilityMy first died. The microphone went out. Amazon sent a second quickly but the microphone is finicky.FunctionIMO, there is no better app. This beats FitBit by leaps and bounds. I LOVE the amount of tracking it does.Biggest IssueThe reason I don't wear it anymore? It doesn't have a screen. I don't need a super interactive screen but if it had a watch, at least, I'd have a reason to wear it. It just doesn't look professional enough to wear during the day and combine that with battery life, I had to switch to a Smart Watch. I'm sad I am not able to wear it like I wanted.",2
844,"I got the Halo at the introductory price. $ 69.00 was a low risk to see if it could provide the information I sought when other fitness trackers were so much more and had a lot of features I just didn't care about. For the first month or two, I tolerated the Halo well enough, but was getting more and more frustrated that the app was not accurately tracking my activities, particularly exercise. It was hardly uncommon for the Halo to fail to record 20-minutes (or more) of my workout activity. The voice tracking report seemed largely inadequate too.Worse yet, rather than using the Halo as a tool to help me track my activity, I became a slave to it, working to ""close "" my circles instead of simply maintaining my work-out routine. If I worked out for an hour, by my circle only said I had 30-minutes in, then I would do 90 minutes.All-in-all, I think The Halo is a good idea. I don't particularly want a smart watch and don't need all that such a device offers. But if I have to choose between paying a little more for accuracy (and getting features I don't really care about in the mix) against spending less to endure frustration that I either need to do ""mental math"" to correct the reported data against the actual results, I'll pay a little more or simply do without either.",2
845,"I am an avid user of wrist trackers whether it be from the company Garmin or Fitbit or even Apple. They all have different features and provide different options for their targeted audience.Halo watch still has not hon down their targeted audience in my experience using this tracker. For instance, there is no set goals even when using Tone to see how you speak with others. To me, the app itself seems a bit scattered and even though it provides information, you don’t receive instructions on what your next steps should be to improve. Fitbit provides this information and it’s free of charge. You can upgrade to premium but it isn’t necessary.I return it because I really like my Fitbit tracker better. It’s not the most expensive one and it’s the same size as the Halo but it motivates me more and provides useful information and ways to improve on my performance. I hope this review helps someone who maybe sitting on the fence on purchasing this product.",3
846,I don't have this anymore I returned it wasn't for me. But well I did have it  it does work extremely well the only thing I didn't like about it was the band.,4
847,"The product does most of what it says. Realistically the sleep analytics are weak compared to other trackers. The movement part is fine for non-athletes, but doesn’t really tend to account properly for intensity of physical activity.The band is mostly comfortable. It gets scratchy once in a while and I take it off for 10 minutes.I’m going to keep using it for a bit, I haven’t been using the body scanning portion since the initial use. I’ve been living in an open area recently. Honestly not much from the analysis seems like it will change my lifestyle.The voice portion does drain the battery as quickly as everyone says. It’s a pain to charge to get it to sit properly in the charger.I’d hesitate to recommend this to a friend when there are so many options on the market.",3
848,"I gave the device a couple months before I left a review. For the most part it works great. My only problem is that it doesn't sync with my phone very well. Almost every time I need to sync it, I have to go into my Bluetooth settings to reset it so that the band will connect. Sometimes it will sync great for a few days, but then it won't sync. The sleep tracking works well as I compare it with another device I wear and I get very similar results. I don't use the voice recognition much because of how it drains the battery life and it also causes syncing issues with my device. Battery life is also very short. It claims that when not using Tone, the battery should last several days. For me, it only lasts about 2 days without Tone and probably around 12 hours with it on. Overall it's okay, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it due to connectivity issues and battery life.",3
849,"Really liked this version of the Halo Band (the newer version is not comfortable and I returned it) it worked fine for about 7 months. The charger was always a bit clunky, and one day my original band just stopped charging not matter how I aligned the device.  Had to worked though the warrentary process (vs. just a return) and got a refurbished replacement; it worked great until about 3 weeks ago and it too stopped charging.I would have worked though the process of getting another replacement but just not worth the time. Three phone calls to get the original replaced and a fourth when my UPS package with the original sent to the KY return center showed as never being received, but UPS showed it as delivered. Amazon took care of the missing item.Update - I did get a call from Amazon the same day as this review asking what they can do and they offered to send another replacement which was unexpected, but I declined. Why go through all this again.",2
850,"I love this device! I love you totally oriented it is to measuring and tracking your overall physical and mental well-being. I like how small and lightweight the small version is. I also have an Apple Watch and unfortunately due to my age and slender wrist size, after having worn the Apple Watch for long periods of time, it is contributing to tendinitis on that hand/wrist. I like that halo measures your BMI and gives easy to understand graphics to show the various levels of movement intensity you have had during the day. I find the sleep app is also really good and is helping me to set better sleep patterns. I was one of the first people to own a Kindle and then a Kindle fire and the Echo, and while I love those devices, I never wrote a review about them. However, I am amazed at how fast I have taken to the halo. As I get older, it’s become more important to me to take care of myself. Having a device like this is about the closest I can come to having a motivational coach, without having to actually pay for a coach! This little device has become my new best friend.",5
851,"There are great reviews out there so I am just going to list a few issues that stood out with me. For reference I used the Amazon Halo band for just over two months; primarily when I was working, asleep, and exercising. I was uncomfortable with the invasive nature of it from the get go, but I decided to give it a shot, after all it's no more invasive than your typical smartphone.- HR BPM differed from my Galaxy Watch, I don't know which one is more accurate, but I suspect the Halo band was the less accurate of the two given what I know about my vitals via doctor checkup.- The app had a lot of interesting tips and 'minimalist' programs, but none of them appealed to me- I didn't care for the tone monitoring, it was incredibly inaccurate IMO; maybe because I have a deep voice and generally don't animate my vocalizations, but all the same that shouldn't be an issue- The charger felt cheap and clunky, but was perfectly functional- There is an incredibly bright green light underneath the body of the watch, it begins strobbing (or perhaps always is) when you fiddle with the watch on your wrist; not great while in bedLastly, it's insane to me how many of the features are locked behind a subscription (the cost is irrelevant). Big Brother Bezos and friends are harvesting, processing, and archiving my very personal data. Isn't that enough?",2
852,"This tracker os actually pretty amazing except that it does not have a watch face.  I work in a career that requires me to document the time repeatedly throughout the day.  I thought I would be ok looking at my phone for the time but that was just too much.I love the tone feature on this and the body scan.  Both are fearures I did not get with my fitbit or samsung health.I would love to see a new version with a clock face (old school) or digital time on it.  Unfortunately,  I have an injury that does not allow me to wear anything on my right wrist so I I have to utilize my left wrist for everything. The band is sleek but it is too much to wear the band and a watch.",3
853,"Not bad for a first try, but missing some simple integrations and features. I'd like to see a widget, so I can get a glance of steps/points/hr etc without opening up the app. Since there's no screen this would be nice.It would be nice if it integrated with Google maps or had a map tracker built in, just about every other band does this. And the fitness programs it does integrate with are SUPER limited. Only 2 that I'm aware of.I would also like the ability to have spo2 or blood oxygen readings in addition to the heart rate it now has. Seems a simple addition.The sleep tracker is great, it's helped me adjust my bed time and wake time to hit peak sleep efficiency.The bmi portion is super realistic and kind of disheartening to be honest. It's a real kick in the pants.I haven't tried the Tone portion, and don't think I will. I work for 911 and patient confidentiality is a must.",3
854,"I think this is an alright product. I use everything except the Tone.I like the sleep tracking, though I've found some nights its a bit off for how long you were in bed. But the amount of sleep is always accurate to 5 minutes.I enjoy the labs for workouts and I think they go well with the heartrate monitor, which seems accurate when comparing against the Samsung Health app.It doesn't take very long to charge.The only thing I really want is to be able to link more apps. Currently they only have John Hancock Vitality and Weight Watchers. Would love to see that capability with the Samsung Health app.But I'm satisfied so far and I look forward to seeing what comes next for the halo.",4
855,"I've seen a ton of reviews talking about the fitness point system and how it's discouraging. I'm not sure if I don't have this problem because the system has been updated but I'm really happy with the tracker. It does detract a point for every sedentary hour, but that's a maximum of 8 points I think. It's pretty easy to recover those points and add to what you've done for the day. I do a lot of short high intensity workouts through the week and get well over the 150 points.The best part is that it integrates workouts, meals, meditations from SO many different programs, so I don't have to have a bunch of separate subscriptions for all these services as this pretty much covers everything I need.",5
856,I liked my fit bit better,3
857,"It doesn’t have a screen and that’s why I like it. We have enough screens and distractions. Put your phone down/away for a while and do things. It tracks sleep accurately and could be helpful and improving ones sleep with programs that are offered through the app. The movement being tracked in intensity makes way more sense then just tracking random steps. I think this is a pretty good device overall for people who aren’t professional athletes or very serious triathletes or mountain climbers. If you are and want more stats maybe whoop would be better for 3x the cost per year, but for the average person who wants to be healthier I think this works as it should and will improve as time goes on.",4
858,"First, I have cleaned my band multiple times.  It smells ok for a couple of hours and then it stinks again.  My wrist smells like the inside of a cast.  New bands are expensive.  I take my Halo band off multiple times a day (every time I wash my hands) and I carefully wash and dry my wrists and still can't get past that smell.  Is it in the material of the band?  Or is it me?  I can't be the only one with this problem.Next, the voice recognition eats battery life so I don't use it.  I don't use any of the ""programs"" included.  Since I don't understand where this unusual photo of me will be stored, I don't use that feature.  I do like the sleep analysis.But my six month trial is almost up and I have cancelled the monthly membership.  It seems some of the ""paid features"" should be included with the Amazon Prime membership that has recently gone up in price.  Since Amazon has not seen fit to do that, $3.99 a month seems like a lot for sleep analysis.I tried to like this device.  But I will probably return to a fitbit.  At least I won't be dealing with that smell on my wrist.",2
859,"So here's what I like most about the Halo:- It tracks sleep very well and analyzes it well in the appThe okay parts of Halo:- I find that the band gives me more credit for walking than it does when I do a more vigorous activity however you can manually add activity in the app and it utilizes the pulse data to assign ""points""- The labs are interesting- The BMI calculations are very interestingThe not so great:- The charger absolutely sucks- If you have it listening to analyze your speech it drains the battery in one and a half days- The analyzation of speech is not helpful whatsoever- The app does not have any motivation tools",4
860,"I have had my halo band since it came out. I have learned to not write reviews right away and of course I forgot to write one. I am glad I forgot. If I had written this in the beginning, I would have given it either 4 or 5. Only because it is difficult to read each heartbeat you have had. There is to big of a span between the heart rate range on the app.Currently...My halo band started disconnecting from the app about every 12 hours or less. Then I began to unpair and re-pair the device. I called for support, he told me to do the exact same thing I had been doing. I told him I had and he told me again to do the same thing and told me if I have further problems to give them a call. He proceeded his rehearsed line to hang up. I was furious. I did call back later on and got a gentleman who apologize and said I have an extended warranty. He said they would send another one. They did not send a brand new one, it was refurbished. I know they are consider new. I AM HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. It may be their app. I have a new phone and other bluetooth items work fine. I have seen in other reviews the same problem. I use to have a cheap one I bought and it was better than this one. I thought Amazon product it must be good. ISN'T IT AMAZING THEY CAN MAKE A SPACESHIP AND FLOAT AROUND IN THE ATMOSPHERE, THOUGH UNABLE TO MAJE THESE FUNCTIONABLE OR THEIR APP FUNCTIONABLE. Very disappointed.",1
861,"Edit 1: Since reviewing, I’ve received several hang up calls and one actual message from Amazon. I’ve also received emails. Note that if you review this product poorly they WILL repeatedly call and harass you at early hours of the morning. Once is enough Amazon! To think I was allowing them access to my conversations when they pull that garbage...yikes.Not great in accuracy compared to my Fitbit. I do like that there isn’t a screen, but the sensor on this thing is HUGE! So uncomfortable. This thing also smells horrible. I should’ve listened to my gut and returned it outright, but I tried it for 2 days/nights and it isn’t any better than my Fitbit. HR tracking is very inaccurate too. I used both a Fitbit and the halo while playing Adventure Fit and there wasn’t more than a 10 heart rate change on the halo, while the Fitbit showed a 40+ heart rate change.The tone thing is pretty inaccurate, inappropriate, and sexist. I’m an American speaking English, which is what this is designed for yet I’m constantly being told I’m opinionated and condescending. I read their script thing and did 10 min conversations to test it several times yet I’m a complete arrogant jerk apparently no matter what I did. For me, I didn’t really like the tone option. It also drained the battery super fast.I do like the videos (the sweat videos are awesome and it’s actually a steal to have access to all the different videos) and stuff you have access to on the app and the free membership for 6 months, but it’s so uncomfortable to wear and gave me a rash. If they offered this membership with the videos for 3.99 a month I’d pay that but I don’t like the band. If you can stand the band, the videos are worth it.Gonna return this and get a Whoop. I really wanted to love this but I’m disappointed with the quality and huge inaccuracy.",1
862,"Using this along with my iphone and my fitness scale app for the last 6 months. This is my honest experienceThe good: It motivates me to move more . It tracks steps . It provides a goal each week. It tracks and rewards intensity of your activity. I love the slim band and face as i have really skinny wrists.The bad: it deducts points for normal workday sitting but does not have an alert on wrist to prompt you to get up and move before it starts to penalize you!! It does not track distance or pace.The indifferent: it has no visual display. It doesnt show the time so i must have my phone on every walk , especially if i have time crunch. This is a bummer in fact... but i knew it wasnt a watch.After 6 months of use, im looking for a new garmin or apple watch .",3
863,"This is the first product review I've ever written but I thought that it was important to do so since it's a new product and Amazon can still improve on it.  My main issues with the product are the following - 1) it does not accurately count activity when you run on a treadmill - the other day I ran 3.5 miles but the Halo only added ~2k steps (and this happens all the time).  I'm not that tall, so should be getting at least 1500 steps per mile.  It just makes me question all the other stats about my activity.  it does count more steps per mile when you walk outside, but I feel like it may overcount there.  2) Sleep tracking doesn't seem accurate - last night, it showed that i was in deep sleep while i was watching a movie (i wish that were true!).  3) the fitness programs on there are not very good.  If SNL was making a parody of a Peloton instructor, they'd use the Amazon running workouts (e.g. to make us sprint harder, the instructor told us to ""imagine there's energy coming out of your heart, and you're chasing it."" - seriously, that's going to make me run faster?).  I hope Amazon puts some effort into improving this but it's such a big company that this is probably the  hundredth thing on their to do list.  Maybe I should just splurge and get the Whoop.",2
864,"Works great and the body fat percentage scans are a cool feature.  I still don't have to pay the 4 dollars a month so I'm in the honey moon period (should really only be 2 dollars a month max but they aren't looking for that feedback I guess).  The biggest issue I have with my halo is that the band is starting to stink. I've left it out to dry multiple times but now when it gets wet it starts to stink. This is an issue for a fitness band you're meant to wear constantly. Whoever put on fabric bands for the device was an idiot and didn't really care about the user. The replacement silicon bands are 25 dollars each, which is ridiculous when they should have offered silicon bands in the first place. Conclusively, it is a cool device but it was clearly created to have you sink money into it over time rather than just pay higher price upfront like other fitness bands.",3
865,Once again I went for a 50 minute walk and it recorded zero in done with it cancelling todayI wore it all night according to the app I didn't have it on me for a device with no screen the battery life is not good maybe lasts 5 days until you turn on the voice recognition then it's 2 by comparison I have a full color watch with more features and it's battery lasts 10 days with much more accurate sleep tracking,4
866,"I was mostly interested in this band to see how I was sleeping. I like to get in bed early to watch TV. The Halo thinks I'm asleep. I get reports saying I slept for 10 hours even though I was wide awake for half that time. The workaround is to make a mental note of when you actually try to go to sleep so you can edit the report in the morning. Other than that, it's fine. Counts your steps and heart rate. I don't think I'll keep the service after the three month trial.",3
867,"I love this product. It's inconspicuous, light, and the battery lasts for 3 days of normal usage per charge. The heart rate monitor is my favorite feature, along with the full body fat scan, which is surprisingly accurate. I don't see the app for exercise classes or routines, but I tried the running one for curiosity's sake and was pleasantly surprised at the integration and effectiveness.The only downside is the included default band. You have to buy a sports band if you'll use this as a fitness tracker. The included band is made of fabric. After 3 weeks use, with it acting as a sweatband, I had to wash it or risk having a gym locker on my wrist 24 hours a day.",4
868,"Tl/dr - if you want a simple band that kills on sleep tracking this one’s great.I love the sleep tracker and I love the activity tracker.  To be honest I use the sleep tracker the most, I bough this because it looked like it would be comfortable enough to sleep in where my Fitbit wasn’t.  I like the mobile app a lot, feel like it’s really informative.  The activity wheel was odd to me at first but I’ve really started to like how simple it is.I love the goal setting features.  I’ve been working on my sleep patterns and this allows me to track and set goals for behaviors that will improve sleep.  I’ve seen immediate results when doing so.  Pretty coolMy biggest beef is that they need to connect it with more devices/apps.  For instance MyFitnessPal and ifit.  That is just a matter of time though since both have a developer API so I’m hopeful for future integrations.Getting my parents to get one as well so that we can encourage each other.In terms of accuracy definitely accurate enough for my purposes.",5
869,"I have had the Halo for months and I wanted to love it but the tone feature depletes the battery too quickly so I turned that off. I was frustrated with having to charge it every other day.  Also I could not get over not having a screen to show the time, steps, bpm, etc.  I found that I stopped going to my phone to check everything unlike with my Fitbit, which I constantly check to see how I was doing. The final straw was this weekend when I went hiking.  I had just finished going up a huge hill and my heart was beating so fast and I looked at my wrist to see my bpm and of course I could not see it. I didn't want to dig my phone out to check.  I think with a screen it would give Fitbit some competition but for now I am retiring the Halo and going back to Fitbit.",3
870,I love the concept of the Halo and compared to other fitness trackers I've used it is as good if not better. The sleep tracking function is awesome and I love being able to get a visual sleep cycle graph.  The heart monitor works well and step counter is accurate. The shape of the tracker causes a sore spot on my wrist if I have it too snug but loosening the band helps. Voice recognition and analysis is fun even if not totally accurate.  I listen to podcasts and audio books and I believe it is picking up on those sounds as it is providing feedback at times when I am alone and not talking. Overall I am happy with my Halo.,4
871,"Think VERY carefully before you purchase this.  I bought my Halo Band during the 'invitation' period.  I was thrilled with it.  I was especially fond of sleep tracking and voice recognition.  I came to rely on those two features of the band.  BUT.  Over the past two weeks, I noticed a problem with the band holding or getting, a charge.  Now it won't charge at all.  I never wore the band while bathing or swimming.  It has stopped working! Period!  This seems convenient since my support period expired in March when the band was humming along just fine.  Now, it seems, my only option is to buy another band at a higher price.  Bad form, Amazon, very bad form.  I have been a loyal Prime member for many years.  I'm not happy with this situation at all.  My advice to potential buyers is to think carefully before you buy.  Caveat Emptor.Product Update June 25, 2021:  Amazon graciously contacted me and replaced my defective Halo with a new/refurbished one.  This one is working.  I returned my old Halo which has been delivered to Amazon's Lexington, KY return site June 19th.  I'm waiting to hear if Amazon acknowledges receipt.  Don't want to get charged again. That would suck.",2
872,I love the Halo but can not afford to keep replacing it. The first one I received lasted for a little more than a year. The clear back plate that goes against the top of your wrist came off after about 13 months. It was out of the 1 year warranty so I purchased another one. 7 weeks after my purchase the same thing...the back plate came off. It is like the adhesive is defective and does not last. Amazon did make it right with me but....they were going to charge me a 20% restocking fee since the return window was closed. I had no idea how to get it covered through the warranty and asked them how to do that. I felt I should not have to pay a restocking fee on this. They did make it right with me. I think they should have an easier way to claim a warranty issue. I was going to buy another Halo but after thinking about it I decided maybe a Fitbit would last longer for me. I love the Halo (I am on WW) but I can not afford to replace it on a yearly basis. Hope Amazon corrects the defect soon.UPDATE...I did get a Fitbit charge and can not believe the difference. It goes directly to my WW app on my phone and computer. No more trying to sync with no luck. I have also noticed the extra points that I earn for my activities is greater than it was with the halo. I work hard and was disappointed with the point activity on the Halo. I thought is was WW understating the activity to get me to do more and lose more weight. It wasn't...the Halo wasn't properly tracking my activity. I have heard this from other Halo users and have verified it myself. Hope this helps others out.,1
873,"I've been an Apple Watch user for a few years now and always thought the calorie tracking was a little bit off because the Fitbit reported much higher burns than my Apple Watch did.  The Halo is actually right on with the Apple Watch which now confirms the Fitbit is pretty off.  I didn't care for the bodyfat tracking, it's hard for me to believe that taking a photo can accurately track body fat.  I found the sleep tracker to also be very off.  On nights I was awake a lot and obviously not sleeping, it would track that I had more sleep than I did.  I found the band to be really uncomfortable during the day and night. I also don't think the tone tracker was quite accurate.  Sometimes it caught the tone correctly and other times it seemed really off.  The body fat, sleep tracking, and tone monitor were the main reasons I got it and with those not being accurate, I returned mine.",3
874,I got this as a gift. And so far I think it's really neat. I like the tone feature. It's been fun seeing how I sound to others! The only thing so far I'm not happy about is that it doesn't have a section in the app for calorie counting.  It would be nice to compare my real time calorie burn with what I eat in one app. I use Lifesum to count my  calories  and I see that Halo has Lifesum features.....but they don't have an option to pair the device and the app. I hope that because it's a new device that this will be updated.,4
875,"I've had my Halo for a week and a half. For the most part I love it!! The app is is simple to use and understand! It works great! I feel the data it collects is far more accurate and in depth than any other fitness band or smartwatch I've had. It is incredibly comfortable to wear, even while I sleep.My only complaint is the battery life sucks. Every other band I've had the battery lasts at least a week. My Halo battery lasts 2.5 days before needing to be charged!! If the battery life was longer I'd give it 5 stars because I really do love it and everything it does!",4
876,After a year and one month the battery on the tracker stopped charging.,2
877,"The best thing going for this band is the comfort, hence I give 3 stars as opposed to less.  I have had this over a month and cannot get consistent sleep data.  It is not that the data is off, it just rarely shows anything.  I have NEVER seen sleep temperature!  Customer support has nto been able to resolve the issue and this is the 2nd one I have used with the same issues.When I contact customer support I receive the exact same initial email, reset, reconnect, etc.  Then they want to to call and we spend 15-30 minutes go over the same thing each time and finally results in being told they will forward the information to the development team and they will get back to me in a few days.  The few days never happens.I have high hopes that when the bugs are worked out that this will be a good product, but for now, it is not ready for market.",3
878,I decided to get the one without the watch face because the whole point was just to keep track of my health and boy is it awsome. It does infact keep track of your tone and that had improved how I talk to people. Than it tells me how I slept which is so helpful because the disturbance is my baby waking me up to eat which helps me keep track of when I fed him his bottle last. This band counts my steps way more than my phone can and actually holds a charge.,5
879,"I’ve had my Halo for almost a year now. I am satisfied with the exercise/heart rate tracking. I think the sleep pattern tracking is WAY OFF and never accurate. I do not utilize all of its features so can’t comment on the ones I don’t use. I don’t have an issue charging the band. I have the charger plugged in my bathroom. I place the band in the charger every morning before I take a shower and while I’m getting dressed. This keeps it always almost fully charged. However, I think the band itself is hard to keep clean. It is machine washable and you can wear the band/unit in the shower. All in all for $70 I’m happy with it. It does encourage me to move more to get at least the minimum required activity level. It helps remind me how active or inactive I have been.",3
880,"What I Like:* I can wear it to the pool without any problems.What I Dislike:* It doesn't calculate my naps. Due to my schedule, I take long naps during the day. It only calculates my sleep at night. I hate that.* When I use the voice feature, it needs charging like you won't believe. So I stopped using that.* I only have one strap, and depending on whether I continue with the halo or not, it's annoying that the strap (light pink) needs to be washed three times a week. It gets dirty very quickly.* My body fat tracker never worked. Two members of my family (far more techy than me) helped. Nothing. Couldn't get it to work at all.At this point, I'm not sure if I'll continue with this. The monthly fee isn't particularly high. Then again, over the course of a year, it certainly adds up.",3
881,"The Halo app is really great.  Easy to install, integrate, and understand.  The issue is the device itself.  My first one failed right at 6 months.  It was an internal failure that Amazon could not figure out - even after I worked with them via the computer and later via telecon for hours!  So they  sent me a new one and off I went.  Then the sensor cover on the back of the Halo fell off 5 months later and the device died.  And no, I am not a swimmer (i.e. I did not get it wet except from sweating).  As I had purchased original unit ~ 1 year earlier, there was no return.  So I'm out of all my data, my device, 3 months of subscription service, and patience.  I'm a huge Amazon tech fan with 8 Echos and dozens of other purchased tech from Amazon.  This time Amazon really failed though.  I wish it was as good as the Echo.  My original one was purchase 6-7 years ago and there hasn't been a problem.  The Halo just does not meet the quality standards I've come to expect from Amazon.",2
882,"The device does exactly four things: Tone, Sleep, Activity and Body Fat analyses.The tone and sleep analyses work and are good. It is cool and fascinating that they work. But once the novelty faded, I realized I did not find the information useful.( The tone analysis tells me everyday I am mildly depressed & irritated. I already know this. What am I supposed to do about it though? )Sleep analyses does not work accurately if you accidently sleep on your arm wearing the watch.The calorie counting in Activity tracking was good enough, and was probably the best and most useful feature.In the Labs section, the app has literally copied and pasted generic articles and videos from the internet. This is the most useless feature of the halo app.The worst part of halo was the body fat analyser. It has a very skewed perception of what a ""healthy"" body is. The body fat analysis is not at all accurate as Amazon claims it to be. If you are anything over a size 6 (in women's measurements) , it will definitely put you in the ""too high"" body fat category and say you are at a very high risk for heart diseases. I am a size 8 and this made me feel like crap about myself. While I understand that all measures of body fat should be taken with a grain of salt, this feature is very very body shaming.",2
883,"I hope it's not a finished product otherwise I would be very disappointed. For example, it has great Lab routines in the app which are supposedly tracked automatically. When I finish a Lab (such as a strenuous strength exercise), it is marked as completed but I'm not given any points, which I believe it should. I can manually add the activity and get credits but that defies the logic of auto-tracking. In fact, I returned my original band for the same reason but the replacement is doing the same thing. So, either it's a work in progress or I have a wrong understanding of how it works. My second gripe is about its sleep tracking. It usually assigns me 10 to 15 mins to fall asleep, discounting an hour and a half which I spent tossing & turning. I haven't concentrated on other feature so I will leave them out of the review. I intend keeping it because I need an activity coach, even faulty as this",3
884,I had this band since 2020 never brought it to the gym. I loved this band so much but This year I got into going back to the gym brought it with me and now it doesn’t work anymore:( I really want to get a new one because I miss it so much but when I charge it it just has a red light and won’t come on anymore:( idk how to contact Amazon about this,3
885,"The back cover randomly fell off while I was sitting in bed reading one night and saw the little black piece stuck to my wrist.  Since Amazon only gives 30 days to return, I guess we'll try to repair ourselves.  I certainly wouldn't say this was a water resistant or sweat-resistant device.  I was actually very careful to take the Halo band off before showering, and I don't do a ton of exercise other than walking.  Unfortunately, I can now say that I know what the inside of the device looks like now!Rest of the review:Charger- Not much to complain about with getting the charger to work.  I remember seeing that before I purchased in reviews.Band- The silver band showed dirt faster than I would have liked.  I would remove the device and wash the band sometimes to remove dirt occasionally, but it still looked yucky pretty quickly after I got it.Sleep function- I don't know that I trusted the sleep functions that much.  Some days, it would say that I didn't go to bed until 2 am, when I'd go to bed at 10 pm, and other days it would say 10 pm.Tone- I used the ""Tone"" function for a couple of days but that drained the battery very quickly, and it is a bit creepy, so I gave up on that.App- The app is ok.  It's a little hard to flip between days if you want to look at your sleep for the past week.  Sometimes it glitches and you have to go out and in several times, but not that bad.  I don't feel that you end up using it that much.  You can mostly stay on the main page.  The Body analysis really is stellar and could truly be worth the money if the thing keeps working for you.",1
886,"The app has some nice features and plenty of workouts included, but I don't think it's very accurate when it comes to sleep and voice tracking. It can be demotivating as others have said.The charging station construction is cheap at best and the pins bent almost immediately. I've been able to get it to charge on it by fiddling with it, but today one pin totally broke and now it won't charge. It looks like my Amazon support expired for this 3 days ago, so perfect timing!I don't see a way to get a separate charging station, so I guess this is now a $90 paper-weight.EDIT: Bumped a star for the service. I got a call from an Amazon rep within minutes of posting, who got me a replacement charger. They do sell them separately, though searching for ""Halo charger"" won't give you what you want.",3
887,"I was excited for this activity tracker band because I wanted something to replace an old fit bit but that wasn't as expensive as the newer fitbits or apple watches. I also liked the fact it didn't have a screen as to not distract me during work and keep me from being constantly tied to my phone. It does everything it advertises, but I just don't love it. The activity tracking is really off, I thought with the heart rate monitor that it would be pretty effective at assigning ""points"" based on the intensity of a workout but it seems to give more ""points"" for steps versus activity. I'll get only 10 points for a 45 min crossfit workout but then 20-30 points for an afternoon leisurely walk of about the same length of time. Just doesn't seem as accurate as other fitness bands out there. I'll be researching to spend a little more money on something that works better for what I'm needing.",3
888,In activities gardening isn’t listed as a choice,3
889,"I wanted something super-thin and unobtrusive. This wasn't it: its bigger than Fitbit Inspire or Luxe. The app was something of a let-down too, lacking customizability or some of the features other trackers have in their apps. It didn't link to my employer's wellness app, although other trackers do. It syncs every hour, draining the battery on the device and the band, but the only time it makes any sense to sync is when you open the app since that's the only way to access the information. The most unique feature, the ""tone"" feature, ended up being just too big brother to use -- I couldn't stand my device was listening to me all the time (no, I don't use Alexa or any other voice activated devices or features). Besides when looking at what the ""tone"" analysis said, it didn't seem to accurately reflect my mood or situation when I did use it. I suppose they didn't misrepresent anything, but I ended up replacing it after two months.",1
890,"I've been enjoying the Halo fitness tracker. While it doesn't have a clock or integration with my text messages, I don't mind that because the constant vibrating of my Fitbit was getting distracting. I like the body composition scans and sleep tracker. The app is easy to use and unlike my Fitbit, I didn't get activity points for moving my wrists when typing or doing dishes! The real plus for me is the Tone feature. It's great to see how I sounded during interactions. That was fun to learn from. The battery life is short, but I have all the features turned on. Charging time is quick, but I need to press the clip to make sure the band starts charging. Overall, very nice and highly recommend!",4
891,"I really did enjoy this Amazon Halo- the sleek, slim and simplistic look made it comfortable to wear everyday. I like the sleep tracker and it was really good at keeping track of your activities. I did notice that it's hard to have it sync to the app if you have another Bluetooth item connected (i couldn't have my airpods connected and Halo connected at the same time) so i had to keep disconnecting my airpods so that my Halo app could sync my activities/fitness steps during the day. I ended up getting use to it so its not such a big deal, but then after 2 months it just stopped working! i never got it wet, i would charge it whenever it was low battery and took care of it like i did with my Samsung and Apple watch that i've previously had. I tried charging it and nothing. It just completely died on me. Which really sucks because i spent a pretty penny for something to not work after 60days. Definitely not good for someone who wants to track their fitness progress longer than 2 months haha. Yeah wish i had a better review for it. but now i'm not sure if I want to replace it out of fear that it'll die on me again and that i'll just flush more cash down the drain.  I think i'd rather go back to my Samsung Gear watch :(",2
892,It only tracks my sleep infrequently. I bought it for the purpose of seeing how many times a night my toddler is disrupting my sleep. It has two major flaws when it comes to the sleep tracker. One  I will wear this uncomfortable band all night long and wake up to find out it hasn't done its job. Second it doesn't allow you to adjust your sleep times beyond what it calculated. So if I crawl into bed at 11 and it says I stopped moving at 12 then 12 is my sleep start and it took me 0 minutes to fall asleep when in reality it took 50 minutes.The rest of the tracker is fine. Uncomfortable but works.,3
893,"This product definitely has it's goods and bads. The app is not great. It's hard to find the scan body section, the app wants to shove options for working out at you and it has limited connectivity to other apps. The good things are that it records data well and doesn't have to be connected to constantly to your phone to save the info. The collected data seems to be well recorded. All in all the product is great.",5
894,"So far, this is really helpful, esp. with sleep and tracking activity.The fabric band is waaaaay too scratchy, though! And I wish there was a soft ankle band instead.The tone thing is funny. Helpful to improve communication.",4
895,"I actually don't use the ""Tone"" part that records snippits of your tone throughout the day and I don't use the body scan... and I don't use cloud storage.... but otherwise I like this band.  It measures my sleep more accurately than anything before....as well as my exercise and it comes with access to free exercise and workout programs ...by all kinds... Orange Theory ...many others... and also for every topic like sleep it has hundreds of sounds and story telling and all sorts of things to try to sleep better... by reputable brands for these topics.... so its pretty cool.  I just don't use the ""Tone"" of voice analysis or the body scan because its too privacy intrusive.  I leave the Microphone ""off"" ...and you know its off because instead of lasting 1 day on battery, I can hardly tell I am wearing it at all....and I charge it about once a week without using the tone monitoring!",3
896,"I bought this totally open minded. Wore it for 6 months. The sleep analysis is fantastic and at first I really enjoyed it. Here's my biggest gripe and probably the reason I'm not wearing it anymore - integration w/ other apps. If they have the ability, they need to integrate this product and it's data w/ Apple so it can appear on your iPhone's health app. The other two things that bothered me, paying for a subscription to access data it's already collecting, and wearing something on my wrist 24 hours a day. Drives me nuts when I sleep.",3
897,"You have to find the right spot on your arm and tightness and then it fits comfortably and is hardly noticeable during any activity, weightlifting, walks, cardio, shower, sleeping, but it does take some playing around to find the right spot that it'll work on your wrist and tightness. It collects interesting data, so far I have used the body scan once and it has produced basically the same body fat % as my impedance scale. I do like the sleep tracking and it seems to be fairly accurate and has shown me I need to sleep more efficiently and I agree with it. Overall I am content with the device and the data it collects and how it displays it to me on the app.",4
898,"Simple, cost effective, motivating way to start or continue a health & fitness journey.",5
899,"Halo opened a new world of sleep tracking for me.  I used this band for a bit over half a year (bed/sleep use only) and then it just.....stopped connecting. Or rather, it bluetooth-connected to my new phone (iPhoneSE) but was no longer is recognized by the Halo app. Charging it, resetting it, bluetooth ""forget device"", etc. to no avail. It just lost its mind. Return window has closed and after 6 months, support window closed too. Zzzzz.....Had to buy another sleep tracker, Oura, which adds heart rate variability tracking (very important for recovery tracking), and subtracts voice recognition (was never thrilled with the Halo-listening-to-me features; i gave it five stars, but wasn't really a user.)When it worked, it was great. And the add-on body-scanning feature is pretty cool. But, I upgraded to Oura and now stuck with a dormant Halo.",3
900,"It's pretty comfortable, I mostly forget it's on my wrist, the only real downside is the spot where the metal contacts my wrist smells like death and I can't figure out why.",4
901,"This little tracker has been really helpful keeping me on track and motivated. There is a wealth of useful features with the halo+ subscription. The body composition feature is amazing, gives a good baseline to reference your progression with exercise. The app has pretty much everything you would need, exercise videos, healthy meal recipes, sleep tracking, motivational programs. The battery life of the band is really good, can go multiple days without having to charge.",5
902,"Do not purchase. While it is a bit clunky, needs to be re-synced repeatedly, and doesn't really capture alot of info I was ok with it since I really wanted something to capture how many steps I take in a day.  Unfortunately, by June, the little cover that protects the chip on the underside of the band had fallen off.  While I wear it daily, I do not partake in any intense workouts.  I live in NYC so I just want to capture how much I walk since that is my main exercise. I think this bit of activity should not warrant the band falling apart after six months.  Additionally, while it seemed to capture my activity level pretty well in the initial months, now it keeps showing I have done some insane intense workouts even though I know I was sitting on the couch at that point.  While I am happy to accumulate the points I am disappointed to have no accurate grasp of my activity.  Amazon also swindles you into this ridiculous membership which really has no added value. It activates after 6 months. The first 6 months are free and then they start charging you.  I have followed the instructions and un-subscribed from this yet I am STILL getting charged.  So basically you buy the band they give you this warranty for six months and after six months, once the warranty has expired, the band falls apart and costs you more than this sad piece of excrement is worth.  Save your money, put it toward an apple watch.  I didn't want the apple watch because I find it big and clunky but honestly this is even more unsightly and un-attractive. Save your money and time, do not purchase this.",1
903,"Won't charge, doesn't track sleep well, voice recognition won't work.  Waste of money.  Needs a direct USB charger like Apple Watch.",2
904,"I got this mainly for sleep tracking to monitor my sleep apnea. Unfortunately it's very erratic and unreliable.  If I go to sleep at 10pm and wake up at 1am to ""use the facilities"" (ahem.), it starts my sleep time at 1am and the prior 3 hours don't show up at all.  Or it will do the opposite - show my sleep from,  say,  11pm until 3am, and when I get up to use the bathroom it assumes I'm up for the day and stops my sleep at 3.  I've tried it for 24 days now - it registered 1 full night's sleep in that time. I'm obese,  so thinking I was wearing it at a bad spot I've tried it 2 inches above the wrist bone as recommended,  about 1 inch above,  and at my wrist - no difference.  I even tried it under my wrist one night with no change.  It was in the exact same spot last night as it was the night it registered the only full night (I measured it to make sure to hit that spot again),  and last night for the 3rd time it registered no sleep at all.  Absolutely nothing.  And me measuring where the sensor was from my wrist the one good night was my deciding factor - why would anyone need something that delicate? I'm not being monitored in a hospital,  I'm wearing a bracelet.  It should just work.  I also put it on my right hand because I sleep on my left side,  so it literally lays on a pillow all night. I've asked to have it replaced to see if this one is just defective,  so I'll hopefully be able to update this abs change my score in case I just got a bad device,  but for now it's just not working out for me and the one thing I got it for.",1
905,"Ok, I do understand that there is a learning curve and we were basically in beta testing. I am fine being thr Guinea pig....for a while buy I want up grades and a functional device. I think that my overall health has become improved because of the feedback i am getting from, activity levels, calorie burn rate, heart rates, recovery time (sleep),  body comp over time etc...i have been able to adjust to be better on my terms! Looking very forward to the gen 2 and will deep dive there! The future is here! Dont get this one, get the gen 2. You will be glad you did! No brainer on price and metrics provided. You do you!",3
906,Love how it tracks your sleep and activity levels. I feel like it’s fairly accurate. Not a fan of the tone feature since it drains your battery faster and I don’t see a real purpose for it but overall great product.,5
907,"I used the Halo for 3 months before putting it in a desk drawer and forgetting about it. Without a screen or haptic  feedback, I felt like all I was doing was wearing a bracelet. It's bulky for not having a screen or speakers. Having to go to the phone for anything was annoying. It does not do much more than what my smartwatch does. The 3D body scan was cool, but you don't need the Halo for that, just the app. Also, the feature that monitors the tone of your voice was interesting but made people around me uncomfortable. They told me Jeff Bezos was listening in. LOL. After a couple weeks of using it I found myself opening the app less and less. One day I asked myself, ""why am I wearing this?"" Since I did not have a good answer, I put it in a drawer and have not been inclined to put it back on.",3
908,"Summary: I’ve tried Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Amazon Halo. Share of wrist is highly coveted and I cannot find enough value in the band/app to seriously consider using this device anymore.What I like-Light weight and generally comfortable to wear-Kind of sleek looking and blends into just about any clothing you wear-Since there is no face, no fear of scratching something-No beeps or distracting vibrationsWhat I don’t like-Step accuracy is incorrect. Tried Halo alongside my Apple Watch and Fitbit and Halo is way off.  This was a trust buster.-Tone feature picked up what others were saying instead of only recognizing my voice. This was a trust buster.-Battery dies in <48 hours (more like 24 hrs). I have enough stuff to charge and I demand more than 24-34 hrs of battery life from something like this.-Body Fat % is a cool feature but overhyped. Maybe use it once or twice and the usefulness quickly wears off.-Does not tell time.  I thought I could live without this but I can’t.-App is $3.99/mo after the free trial and I don’t find enough value in the features to keep paying.-Labs did not apply to me at all, could find basically all of this stuff on YouTube.-Doesn’t work with Strava, Wahoo, or any other fitness app I use.",2
909,It is interesting to see how when I don't get enough sleep how my day tends to function as opposed to when I am well rested. The exercise programs that are available to me are invaluable the number of steps is great but more important to me is the heart rate monitoring along with the sleep tracking which have both been invaluable. I am feeling better because I'm taking better control.,5
910,"If I'm being honest, I was expecting more? I think the app is the most disappointing. I mean, it does everything that it advertises. The app usage and all just feels like it falls a little flat. I personally prefer the fitbit app. I think I was the most excited about the tone monitoring but, honestly it drains the battery so fast that I don't use it. So, it's just a basic fitness tracker, aside from the body fat percentage part. Which, is cool and all but, I could do without after using it. I would say that if I could do it over I would have bought a fitbit instead. But I was so excited for this one I think I had to buy it and use it to know for myself. If you are questioning it, go with a fitbit. Overall, its a basic fitness tracker, if you don't see yourself using the tone or the body fat percentage feature.",3
911,"I tried all the features. The points system didn’t make much sense. The more I walked, the more the ‘goal for the week’ increased. I didn’t find it useful. The sleep tracking didn’t do much for me either, plus it’s not convenient to wear it. It’s also not too accurate. The microphone drained the battery like crazy, so I just turned off. The body picture: I tried. Meah. Now after 5 months, the device doesn’t charge. I disabled the app and wanted to pack the device to give it away, but it won’t charge. All in all I was excited to try this device. I gave it a good go. Now I don’t want it. If someone is disciplined and wants to loose weight and stay active, maybe this is a good device to try. Not for me. Too boring.",3
912,"I have really enjoyed the Halo Band so far. My primary mode of exercise is weight training, so being able to track other movement like steps and heart rate makes it easier to add in movements I need but am not quite as enthusiastic about doing. The movement function is also a very cool addition, and I like that they have a legit specialist like Kelly Starrett doing the exercise demos. The one major drawback to me is the cost of replacement bands. It only comes with one, and the cloth band is very comfortable but is not ideal when you start to sweat.",4
913,"I received a free Halo Band through my insurer, along with a six month subscription to the Halo services at Amazon. I tried it out for a few months, then received a notice that it had failed. I was sent a replacement which I was unable to pair with my phone. Since I still haven't figured out how the band might be useful to me, I have abandoned it. It provided me with slightly more detailed health information than other devices, but there was no real value to continuing with it. Additionally, no other fitness band that I've used failed so quickly. In fact, most of them still work, even though I've upgraded. The only value of this devices appears to accrue to Amazon as they now have access to some of my health related data, which they can potentially monetize.Addendum: Now Amazon is charging me for the replacement item even though I returned it ages ago. I took it directly to an Amazon Store, but because I had inadvertently printed the UPS label, they refused it. They did pack it for me and I took it to the UPS store a few doors down. I did this within two days of receiving the replacement (which also doesn't work). They are billing me despite an unsolicited call from Amazon to find out why I gave it a bad review. Furthermore, I NEVER requested a replacement of the original device; the y sent it to me unsolicited. Unfortunately, I have not yet figured out how to dispute the charge directly with Amazon. I'll have to wait until the charge appears and fight it through my credit card company.",1
914,"I would give the Halo 4 stars for those just beginning a fitness program, and for those that eat, sleep and live in the mainstream way. It accurately tracks your steps, sets an activity goal for you, and incorporates the intensity of your activity. The programs are decent and include things such as meditation, healthy snacking, and all levels of fitness. I would give this one star for those that already have an established fitness routine. You aren't going to learn much more than the average fitness tracker will tell you: steps, heart rate, sleep quality. As for sleep, the Halo is useless for me. As a third shift RN that sleeps during the day, it does a horrible job tracking my sleep (which I guess is an improvement since it used to not track daytime sleep at all). I usually get negative activity points for being ""sedentary"" while I sleep during the day. The tone feature is interesting but not very accurate. It only picks up on key words. If I were to tell an off color joke about death, it would tell me I am sad. Key words are taken out of context. The app is easy to use, and the body fat assessment is a plus if you are interested in sending a nearly naked pic of yourself to Amazon. Overall, this benefits me little. I will not keep using it after my free trial.",2
915,"This is really not what I expected and it is also inaccurate. I compared my number of steps with another device I have and also with my iphone, and the difference is discrepant. I didn't understand from the website that this wasn't a watch and honestly to me it doesn't make any sense. The app is really hard for me, it has a lot of information and it's hard to navigate and find what I want.",3
916,"I'm sorry to say it, but this is a disappointing product.  There are essentially four features: 1) Sleep tracking (works ok, about as well as the competitors'); 2) heartbeat (every fitness tracker has it); 3) Voice tone; and 4) Body fat tracking.The unique feature is the voice tone which, I'm sorry, just does not work well.  The evaluations aren't accurate or reliable. The interface is not easy to use or helpful. This is bad AI.  Its also, frankly, conceptually bad. The two-dimensional display just isn't useful or intuitive. This feature needs to go back to Product for redesign.The body fat thing is pretty cool, because it has a slider that shows what you would look like naked at different body fat percentages. But this does not actually use the band in any way.  Its just a machine learning model applied to images from your phone. So what's the point of the band?  Also, while cool, its not very useful. There's a big difference between changing your body fat percentage by dropping fat vs. building muscle.The other features are, well, basically what you'd get out of a fitbit.  The app seems mostly interested in selling you at-home fitness exercises.Also - it won't share data with Apple Health.  Seriously?  Amazon and Apple are going to compete by siloing my health data from each other?  I'm sorry, but on that issue, that's gonna be a hard ""no!""  This is my health data - your app MUST share it with and only with whatever I choose. If your sleep detection is marginally more accurate than Apple's, but you won't share it with Apple Health so the apps I use for my alarm can't read it, then the additional accuracy is just useless to me.I was optimistic about this product and I'm disappointed.  I will keep the band, and if Amazon improves the software, would give another free trial a try sometime later.",1
917,"Pro: I bought this as a way 1.) to track my sleep to show my Dr and 2.) to track my steps. It seems very accurate for both and I would highly recommend it for these purposes.Con: The Activity readings - I work a desk job 10+ hours a day, so even if I walk in the morning the program takes my daily points AWAY for being too sedentary. The Nutrition options for a KETO diet were limited. I'm not trying to lose weight so I don't pay attention to the movement, tone, body, or calories tools and can't comment on them.",5
918,"I've been jealous of my hubby's Halo since I got it for him (I got approved for the invitation and he didn't), but now that it's open I was finally able to get one for myself too and I am thrilled with it.  I already knew most of the features and functions, but couldn't wait to see how accurate the information was going to be for me (turns out: very!) Also, it does way more than I realized - hubby clearly hasn't been using it to it's fullest potential - and it's super comfortable.  I'm very happy so far!Update: 5 months later -We've now had both chargers break - the pins have bent and cannot be straightened back to functioning.  Why reinvent the wheel?!  It could've just been USB C...Tone function stopped working after 2-3 months.Body composition stopped working at some point or maybe never worked at all - to test it I took scans of myself, then a week later had my 14 year old son stand in as my body double.  He is taller than me, weighs less but had an almost identical body fat % output.  Tested it again 2 weeks later with someone else who is my height but much heavier, again same results.  Silly nonsense!Wake up in the night, but stay fairly still - like if reading or just trying to fall back asleep?  It can't tell you're awake and will register this as sleep time, making the sleep tracker inaccurate by hours.Having trouble falling asleep?  Don't worry, it will penalize you for being asleep by taking away points as you're ""too sedentary""The device has TONS of potential - we just need a better way to charge it and some software updates.  All the same, until it's updated I will not be buying a new charger or paying for the monthly memberships.  Too bad. :(",1
919,I've really enjoyed the Halo. Gives you a lot of useful health information & tips. Love all the helpful sleep & meditation sounds & stories. I also like the movement feature & promos to complete excersises.My main complaint is the body fat tracker isn't accurate enough yet. It seems heavily dependent on how much lighting there is. I took 3 different scans around my house within minutes of each other & got totally different numbers.This feature was the main excitement I had for trying the Halo. Hopefully it improves in the future,4
920,"I was having a hard time deciding between an apple watch or fitbit as my first fitness tracker when I saw this on amazon. The no-screen approach piqued my interest. I used to use my iphone to count my steps and was getting unmotivated because I wasn't hitting ny goal everyday, but Halo allows me to track the duration and intensity of my activities and as long as I hit 150 points per week as recommended by WHO and CDC I'm good. I don't really care for the tone feature and from other reviews it just drains the battery. The sleep feature is pretty fun and gives insight about deep, light, REM sleep, and even disturbances throughout the night so it's pretty cool. Lastly, the body scan looks neat but I watched a video of someone comparing it to an actual DEXA scan and it was around 5% off but still a decent tool to visualize changes in your body. Overall really pleased with the product and glad I was able to get it at the reduced price, saved me a couple hundred bucks and I got what I wanted from a fitness tracker.",5
921,"I got this as an early access, and overall the sleep tracking and fat analysis is pretty decent. The voice analysis is neat, but the battery drains incredibly quickly if it's enabled.Even without it enabled, the band would have a nearly dead battery by the time I'm heading to bed.. EVERY DAY. The last time I want to have to wait for it to charge. If I skip the charging, the band dies while I'm asleep, ruining a big part of why I wanted this, the sleep tracking.After getting exhausted with losing days of data due to the battery life being so short, I just stopped charging it and put it away.I then purchased a fitbit charge 4,and so far I highly prefer it as it has a screen with a watch face (I missed being able to see the time) and some basic, no interruptions apps to either track your workouts or, my FAVE, it takes you through breathing exercises to relax. Has GPS and an altimeter to track when I'm taking the stairs, too.I haven't put my halo back on, nor do I have any desire to use its any longer. Having to charge it once or more everyday ruined any convenience. I can't honestly recommend getting one.",2
922,"Pro's: The Halo does not compete with my Apple WatchCon's: The Halo does not compete with my Apple WatchI was really interested in the idea of a 'health band' that isn't a watch, as I already have a smart watch - thank you very much.  This device/software needs a lot more work though.  It really doesn't do anything more than my watch already does - and does better mind you.  Also, my apple watch doesn't require a subscription.The software can certainly be improved - and probably will by the time most are reading this.  Right now though, whoa.  What a mess - the UX/UI is just terrible to be honest.As for the hardware.  ( I didn't think this purchase out enough - and that's on me, don't be me. ) Back to the hardware:  this ought to have had a usb-c connector for power.  I'm just so over having a million different cables to charge stuff.  And the charging setup for this band is really weird - operationally speaking to use.  Sure a usb-c connector might be a way to get dirt/water in... I'm sure there's a solution to this.  Hell, maybe wireless charger? ( just spit balling here.)The band - I liked how the grey fabric looked.  Feel?  Well, not so much.  The material looks like it would have some stretch to it - it does not sadly.  Also, I guess I needed to pick the large choice - it is a pain to get over my hand (due to the lack of any give in the band material).This is a beta product to be sure.  I only hope that the software is re-thought out, the band material is made a bit more forgiving, the charging mechanism is thrown out, and finally the subscription ended asap.",1
923,It is so accurate on the sleep that it’s scary but I love every bit of my halos membership I am able to pick routines that I would like I’m able to pick diets that work best for me overall it’s my best friend there is one downfall and that is if you run on a treadmill or walk on a treadmill it will not pick up those steps which is a little disappointing!,5
924,"I decided to try the Halo to track ""non-workout"" activity - which it does well. The point system provides a quick, consistent guide that I like better than tracking steps.The sleep tracker does not do as good of a job as I had hoped - but then my sleep issues may not be common. I am up and awake more than the app says, which decreases value as a tool of ""relativity."" I appreciate how it tracks deep sleep - with the new finding on Alzheimer's, I'm paying more attention to that, and the Halo provides data that is helping me make different choices.All in all, I'm rather happy with it, even with its limitations.",4
925,"I was looking for something to help with monitoring my sleep and activity. This little band gave me so much more! I’m able to monitor my tone (attitude) during the day, which is great during a pandemic in customer service! Besides get helpful tips on healthy eating, sleeping and activities. The 6 month free trial is great and I can see continuing it to stay on top of my health in all areas. I am 70 and a firm believer in “use it or lose it!”",4
926,"The build and durability feel great.  It doesn't have a screen, and that's fine for me.  I wear a watch on my left hand and this on my right hand.The data collection seems to be generally consistent for steps and heart rate.  Sleep tracking isn't nearly as good as either the FitBit or the old Microsoft Band device.Feature wise.....it counts steps and overall activity (heart rate mainly) well.  The tone and body scan features are borderline useless, gimmicks, at best.  The software and data visuals are in a beta state.  It doesn't compete with Fitbit.  The battery is weak, when you consider the fact that it doesn't have a screen -- it needs to be charged every 24 hours (even with the Tone feature turned to the low setting).  The service fee is small but still ridiculous, when you consider that Amazon (and others) are using these for data collection.I do like the simplicity of a face-less tracker, rather than a distracting device.  And it works well enough for tracking activity, steps & sleep.  I don't think it's a bad product, but I wouldn't recommend it over alternatives, especially at the current price point.  This should be a $50 device, tops.",2
927,"The Halo is fine. The best thing? Its sleep tracking is excellent and related feedback is useful. The tone analysis is intriguing and works just fine. I don't need it to have a screen, so that doesn't worry me. My Garmin offers the screen stuff I require. Main complaint? The Halo app is generic, not tailored to me and my activity level. I don't need to do a program that encourages a walk in the morning when I run every morning. I don't need to do a program that gets ne to 150 activity points in a week when I already get 2,000. Paying a monthly fee for access to these programs in the app is also a drag. I think I am going to stop using it, since my Garmin tracks sleep as accurately. The Halo has some promise as a product, but doesn't yet deliver much that my Garmin doesn't do.",3
928,"I am loving this new band with it's simple, comfortable design and getting to know all the features. I do miss not having my 'watch' tell me the date/time and that I have to have my phone with me all the time now. Something I dont normally do, odd as that sounds. I do like the sleep function but the hours 'ASLEEP' and 'Time To Sleep' aren't actually that accurate as it counts my time in bed reading (hour or 2 or more) as being asleep or time to sleep. Must be a good book to keep me so immobile and entranced! Looking forward to using it more as there are a lot of neat features I haven't even tried yet!",4
929,"I've had this. and for a few months now and in my 2nd band because the 1st one stopped working.When it works, it's great but accuracy is not its strongest point. the sensor on the bands I had and have are horrible for some reason. Before I do any workout or goto bed i have to make sure that the band is reading my vitals. 90% of the time it is not reading. so I have to keep readjusting and hitting the connect button on the band. but if I forget to that my workout or sleep isnt recorded. so trying to keep track of my workouts or sleep is a no go since it works only when it feels like it. all I can think of is that they need a better sensor. I have also used Amazon's troubleshoot advice but that still dosent correct the accuracy.",3
930,"If you've reached the review section, you are probably still researching and questioning whether to purchase or not. The product details and images are the simplest and most effective way to figure out what Halo does. Amazon has been very transparent in how the band works and with what it does. Everything they say is accurate and it doesn't do more or less than that. It is a simple product with a streamlined and easy user experience. The heart rate is accurate within 1bpm of a Garmin or Wahoo chest monitor (as my home experiments show). This is very similar to the *cough*way overprice*cough* Whoop band and helps you track your activity and sleep throughout the day.The app is fantastic and has countless ""workouts"" for the mind, sleep, and body. Fantastic.My only complaint is the thickness. Now I'm not saying it's TOO thick, but with today's tech and Amazon's resources, I mean c'mon Amazon, it really should be a lot thinner.Overall it's a great, affordable activity/sleep/wellness tracker and the app offers hundreds of hours of body workouts, mind workouts, meditations, sleep exercises, and more.",5
931,"The Amazon Halo band does what it says for the most part. For some reason, the Halo band does not accurately track my sleep. I have followed the band guide and all instructions and I wear the band correctly, not too tight or too loose, and I do not sleep on the band, and I make sure it is charged before bedtime.Sometimes I get a sleep score of 5 or 12 that says I got poor sleep. A lot of times I get no sleep score at all. This problem really makes the rest of the band features inaccurate. On nights that I get no sleep score, which is often, it counts as sedentary time. So I might wake up and have no more sedentary time left and immediately being losing points for activity. I have included a photo of this mornings sleep results in which I’ve been given 2 minutes of sedentary time for the day instead of 8 hours. Though it clearly has measured my lack of movement, it is not able to accurately count my minutes of sleep.When one component of the app and band do not work properly, it directly affects the accuracy of other components. This band is demotivating for me because of this. There is no way this band can help me set goals if I can not see accuracy in the data leading to results.",2
932,None,3
933,"I have been using Apple Watch and Polar heart monitors for a long time not for Cycling, Sleep, Nutrition, Fitness, etc... I tried Halo and decided it is an entry level product at best.  Canceled the subscription and shelved the Halo for a later yard sale. If you do not have a smartwatch or perhaps Fitbit already this may work for you.  If you do, then you are covered, this is a novelty item only.",3
934,"I LOVE THIS DEVICE BUT THIS MORNING ABOUT 6 MONTHS AFTER MY PURCHASE THE PROTECTIVE SCREEN FELL OFF. IT SAYS THE DEVICE IS SAFE IN WATER BUT I HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN IT OFF BEFORE SWIMMING, SHOWERING ETC. JUST DUE TO SOME OF THE REVIEWS I READ. I AM SURE I CAN JUST SILICONE THIS SCREEN BACK ON BUT I WILL BE CONTACTING THEM TO SEE IF THEY WILL HELP ME OUT ON THIS ISSUE FIRST.",4
935,Like all the features it has and offers.,4
936,"I've had my Amazon Halo since around Thanksgiving and I'm happy with it so far. It's very comfortable to wear and sometimes I forget I'm wearing it. I have learned quite a bit about the tone of my voice, my body fat and the labs are really terrific. The step counting and motivation of the points is what I really like. I've pushed myself a lot more because of the Halo. The Halo app is really terrific, easy to use and navigate. My only nitpick is a little bit here and there I notice the accuracy of the steps and even the sleep amount seems to be off, not all the time but enough for me to question. One morning after I walked another 1,000 steps or more the previous night, I noticed that most of the steps were not counted. It's like they just disappeared. I hope with updates it might be accurate all of the time. Still, I would recommend the Halo as it is quite good. I find the motivation to stay healthier and to improve to be a good reason to get one.",5
937,"Using the Halo has given me so much more motivation and confidence in my ability to better myself! I have become so obsessed with checking my new scores and finding different beneficial activities to do throughout the day.The band is slightly uncomfortable at first, but you get used to it and it's nice not to try and squint at a little screen.** Aslo it works just fine on the underside of arm which is more comfortable **The app is amazing! It gives a very clear understanding of each score and how you are progressing. There are ENDLESS programs for every type of workout, diet, sleep aid, and mental health improvement.The body scanner i was leary about but it gives you a much clearer understanding than just using a bmi calculator.The tone scanner has had bad reviews but I've found it to be 100% accurate and definitely makes me think about how I'm coming across to others, especially my children when frustrated.",5
938,"I am really disappointed in this device, the app is awful and hard to navigate. The app is slow and glitchy and I avoid using it as much as possible which makes the band irrelevant because there is no display. I am fine with a simple band - but then make the app useful.The tone function doesn't provide you any substantial information, ie. will tell you that you sounded ""angry"" but not what words or tones made it that way. I don't want them to record my entire day, but even just letting me know the trigger words that indicated a negative mood.For the sleep function, I find it interesting but I really don't understand how it correlates. I woke up one morning and felt like I had a terrible night's sleep. I look at the app and it recorded it as a ""Very Good"" night sleep. Who knows if it's accurate...Finally, I thought this would be equivalent to a Fitbit and assist me with exercise. Unless you are looking at the ""live"" function on your phone you can't look back and see your heart rate after an exercise or walk. The only thing I like about it is that it tracks my steps and connects to my WW activity on the app. However, I don't think that makes it worth the cost.",2
939,"Functionally, the Halo does everything a normal sleep and activity tracker. There are a few key problems and missing features;Sleep AlarmMany current gen bands have the ability to set a silent, vibrating alarm. Some even will gently wake you in a window that matches your rem cycle. The Halo does not.SubscriptionWhat the subscription gets you is “cool” but not worth the price. I do like a lot of the content but it’s nothing you can’t get for free.Band ComfortThis one was the real killer for me. The band material is rough and itchy. Worse than that, the sensor portion causes me a lot of irritation very quickly. This photo is from 10 minutes. It gets worse fast.ConclusionI think Amazon is smart to enter the tracker race but they’ve got a late start. I think come V3 they will have a decent Apple Watch alternative!",3
940,"So far I am loving it!  Gives GREAT sleep history, activity, and even the tone works.  My only ""gripe"" is the battery doesn't last long enough.  It does charge quickly so you don't miss out on too much of your activity not being tracked.  My second ""gripe"" is the band got dirty pretty quickly.  It says you can wash it, but I am worried it will damage the device so I haven't tried it yet.  Once you delve into the details, it gives you Heart beat information... sleep temperature changes... and probably more I haven't discovered yet!",4
941,"I've been in the market for a new fitness band but didn't want something that was distracting or heavy on my wrist. In comes the Amazon Halo band, and I've really enjoyed it so far. It provides some great insights into my (not-so-great) sleep cycle and actually suggests ways I can help it. The body composition feature is great as I start to get back into shape again; I feel like I'm making some tangible progress instead of just going by whatever is on the scale. I love that it's lightweight, quick to charge, and isn't irritating to my skin like other watches have been. The accompanying app is great and easy to use as well. It does everything I wanted it to do without being bulky, inaccurate, or distracting.The tone feature is really cool, too. I actually turn it on and off because the tone feature burns the battery out faster, but it has made me more aware of my tone and how others may hear me vs. how I hear me. Really cool piece to have.",5
942,"Why 3 stars ? I bought this to track sleep habits but it doesn't recognize when I go to bed by up to four hours and lately, not at all. I am operating off 90 min.s  to no sleep at all evidently. Lol. I do feel vindicated for taking a nap.  Sleep temperature doesn't  register.  I evidently toss and turn too much for it to track my sleep habits. And then it will penalize me for ""sedentary time"" cuz I'm not tossing and turning enough, to satisfy as exertion, lol. Just lazing around till daylight.  Steps and calories seem correct. BMI too. Tracking heart rate is nice and will show improvements over time.. Can't find the app for the Fire tablet. Decent product overall.",3
943,"At first I didn't like that it didn't track my sleep during my unconventional hours. However that seems to not be an issue anymore.Update.  Been wearing it daily since purchase.  This morning I go to check my hours of sleep. Only to my surprise,  it hasn't sync in 14hrs. I refreshed double tapped the button and nothing.  When I took the band off the plate was hanging off. So now I have no fitness tracker.  I'll go with s Samsung watch now or fit bit. My only other issue I had was that I couldn't share the info with other fitness/ wellness apps on my phone. Like Samsung health or pulse.",4
944,"This is an awful device.  The final straw was it quit charging after 6 months of periodic use. What a waste of money.  The activity measurement is awful. Read the other reviews on that. The voice recognition creepy.  The fat analysis will mess with your mental health.  If you are a woman with loser skin or subcutaneous fat/cellulite. your reading WILL be disappointing no matter how hard you work out or how much weight you lose. I lost 25 lbs with a lot of hard work. I might as well have not tried per Halo's feedback. BTW. I I am 5'5"" and went from 156 to 131. Not a large person by any means. My initial measurement was 40% body fat and only came down to upper 30%s (but I could never get a final measurement since the horrible designed charger quit charging it). Each and every time I did the scan, I beat myself up for days after as I clearly wasn't making progress per Halo. Mental health is worth way more than providing Amazon more data.  The pictures are super unflattering too as you are stripped down to your undergarments or bikini.  It is a very invasive process. I feel strong that this device will lead people to trigger or retrigger eating disorders vs. promoting good health and fitness.  My only positive was the sleep feature seemed in line with my Fitbit Sense that I will be sticking with as you don't buy a fitness tracker with the primary reason measure sleep. Please save your money on this one and go get a real body fast test if that is your objective.",1
945,"It’s massive inaccurate for both sleep and activity tracking.It promises to be so advanced as to reveal sleep stages, but fails to even report how long you’re asleep accurately. It’ll be off by 2 hours sometimes!The main issue is reading before bed or watching TV while laying down. It randomly adds that as REM or deep sleep. Lol if something as obvious as being awake can’t be detected, it has no hope of knowing the more detailed info it pretends to report.The sleep quality score is completely off.Activity score is suspect. It promises to detect workouts and change your “activity level” for that time, though it always underestimates by random amounts of time, reporting 50%-95% shorter than actual.If it underreported consistently, that would at least allow you compare the daily/weekly trends, but it doesn’t. Your activity score jumps around randomly.What is the point of this thing?You can’t rely on any data. You can’t track anything. You can’t learn anything. You can’t improve anything.The only reliable thing is the membership fee hitting your card promptly each month.",1
946,"This is a great fitness tracker for monitoring activity, sleep tracking, motivation to move more with simple point based tracking. The app is clean and minimalist showing only necessary info. If you already wear a smart watch this would make a great companion tracker.The Halo DOES NOT track steps & DOES NOT sync with most common fitness tracking apps like MFP, Google or Apple, etc. The sync is limited to WW for now as far as I can tell. This really limits the usefulness if you use anything else for calorie tracking and want to auto import activity data to adjust calories. I knew this ahead of time so the feature limit is not baked into the rating, just an FYI.Not sure how i feel about the body scan feature, I sometimes take photos for tracking progress so im used to it.. just be aware that even the 3D model representation shows more detail than id ever be comfortable publicly sharing. But then again this is meant to be a private progress tracking feature so I'm just going to go with it.",5
947,I’m a fitness trainer wb20.io and I love the is tracker more than any and I’ve tried many.  The Bodyscanner is surprisingly accurate with body fat and daily calories burned is a tool I use to dial in my diet for fat loss or muscle gain. The voice analysis has given me insights into many things. Tbh I’m more and more surprised and I’m not one to write reviews.,5
948,"I am no longer sure what I purchased.  When I think about traditional fitness and sleep trackers this doesn't really fit the mold.  My original purchase was because of the tone feature.  The issue with that feature became the biggest issue with the entire device.  Battery.  This is a huge issue with almost every fitness tracker and watch, but here it forced me to turn off the tone feature.  Then I noticed that my band was not connecting to the app to report it's status.  This made me have to work at ensuring the band in syncing.  Then it came to what data is being tracked.  Sleep is tracked, bit to what end?  I can download a million free apps to give me the sleep data Im getting from this band.  And it made me think why not just offload the tone feature and part of the sleep tracking to a user's phone.  Then what data is is getting on fitness.... HR..... Is that it?  The device is as basic as basic can be, the app has a great bunch of features and a great library of content, but I bought a band that is t being used for what I want to use it for.  The shipped band does not work well with larger user's switch to the sport band asap.",2
949,"There is nothing I dislike about this product. While I was skeptical of having to take a whole body picture, I found that after i did, I became extremely motivated to get in shape. Since starting to use the Halo Band I have lost 16 lbs. My results speak for themselves.Also the sleep tracker has given me great information and helped me find a better sleep pattern!",5
950,"Not for people with office jobs, or small children - this tracker works, I suppose, but the way it tracks is really disheartening. Every time I open the app I am sad to see my activity score, because even though I might have, say, 20 hours of activity in the last three days, it shows 1 or 2 because in between those activity hours I was doing my job and had to sit down- sedentary time is subtracted from active time. To add insult to injury, unless you are swinging that device-wearing arm like a madwoman all the time, none of your daily here and there is tracked. If you are nursing- 0 points. Walking and pushing a stroller- 0 points. Walking while carrying something (a baby) - 0 points. Get my drift? Uninstalling and going back to my Fitbit, this was a waste of money.",3
951,"Ok Im going to have to say this product didn’t work for me...now Im not saying its a bad product I just don’t think the make up of it was taught through enough for every consumer.  My issue with it which prompt my return of the device is comfort, let me say this you barely notice you are wearing it but sleeping in it was my issue and also the fit of it.  Now might I add I have a very very small wrist the width of the device is the width of my wrist which makes it awkward when trying to sleep. I woke one morning with a small cut on my wrist and redness and that is one of the features I was looking forward too since I suffer with sleeping issues. As far as everything else I cannot say due to I just stopped wearing it. The product just wasn’t a good fit for me.",3
952,"I'm a fan of this no-screen design. Also, I fundamentally trust the activity tracking the device provides. Plus, I like the simplicity of the point system Amazon came up with, i.e., targeting 150 points for a baseline active week, and upwards for real activity.The problem is that the sleep tracking is borderline useless as it is now. I might be the only one in this country, who reads or watches shows before going to sleep, I guess. But my problem is that when I do so (95% of nights), the devices thinks I'm already asleep or trying to sleep. So the workaround is that I take of the band for the time of watching things at night. But than 90% of the time, I forget to put it back on before actually trying to sleep... I wish there was a feature in the app where you can override the automatically detected sleep period at least.",3
953,I got this when they first came out and wear it all the time and I was impressed with it. Then they apparently changed the software last spring and the sleep tracking was not as accurate. Then it started doing funny things and they sent me a new (refurbished) one.Sleep tracking was the same as the other and a couple months ago the voice analysis just stopped working even though it says it's on and ready.More recently I've found the sleep analysis to have become worthless. There are too many days when it captures no sleep at all or it starts capturing data hours after I fall asleep. In addition it registers every move or I don't know what as an awake period so even though I may have slept 6 hours straight it tells me I slept 1.5 hours.Totally worthless for sleep. Mine went in the trash and I bought a Garmin which works as it should and is way more accurate and doesn't cost much more and does more.,2
954,"So I love the sleep tracking. For the most part is pretty accurate. While I do know it takes me longer to fall asleep than the halo says the tracking during the night seems to be more accurate than my Apple Watch with more insight and how I can improve.The bad it doesn’t always count my labs. Which can be a glitch but it is what it is.Now the ugly. One of the features that I was most looking forward to was having halo tell me how I spoke with people and if I was to gruff or what not. The screen shot that I posted. I was on vacation and I didn’t talk with anyone that day. No phone calls, no yelling my fur baby, no yelling at the TV. The only thing that was playing was an audiobook and a couple of movies. So if you are getting the halo for this feature more than anything else I would hold off they have bugs to work out on this front.Do I think that it is worth the money in the long run for the service? Only if you want help with work outs, sleep tracking and such. Otherwise I would stick with your Fitbit, iWatch or any of the others that have been out there for awhile but that’s just me. Hope that helps.",2
955,"I waited a few weeks before reviewing the Halo. I am very satisficed with the product. I purchased the Halo for the body scan and lab features, which work well. I agree with users complaining about the band, which isn't so comfortable. I will invest in a silicone band, which I hope helps with wear. The body scan is great, but do not use if you have any body image issues. It was a real wake up call for me and jump started my commitment to losing weight. However, I was a bit jarred by the avatar showing my body image. I enjoy the labs and the variety available. I mostly focus on low-impact labs including PVolve and Openfit, which haven't disappointed.Overall I would purchase again and I am hopeful the tech will improve. If you're not into app based tracker, this isn't the right product. Also, if you have body image issues, the scan function may not be right. I don't use the Tone feature so I can't rate.",5
956,"Update: It's been 5 months since my free monthly membership expired. I took my halo band off that day and haven't worn it since. I keep hoping that Amazon will come to their senses and get rid of the ridiculous subscription model for the features on this Fitness tracker. Just sell the Halo band and include the features with their Prime Membership. It's that simple.I loved my Amazon Halo up until my free trial for the monthly membership expired. You lose all the cool features without the monthly subscription. It pretty much now only counts my steps and tells me what time I went to sleep and woke up. My favorite features were the body scan every two weeks (which showed your body fat percentage), the activity score, & the sleep score. I never used the tone feature or watched any of the exercise videos in the app. The tone feature is kind of useless if you ask me.I'm so sick and tired of all these companies wanting to make everything a ""subscription model"", so you buy their product, then you have to pay a monthly subscription fee for the rest of your life. You should not have to pay $3.99 a month for these basic features on the Amazon Halo, when they're free on most of the other fitness trackers. I've worn mine everyday for the past 9 months. My subscription just ended yesterday, and I actually took my halo band off and will no longer be wearing it because it's now useless. I would have never purchased this band knowing I'd lose all its features without the monthly subscription. This was a complete waste of money.",1
957,"I love the device itself – the step tracker is awesome and tracks intensity of my steps and the sleep tracking (when worn on the opposite wrist for side sleepers) is amazing and highly detailed. However, I was disappointed with the medium fabric band, as it only has a few rungs and did not come close to fitting on my (bony) wrist. I ended up having it on way too tight and it cut off circulation on my wrist and then my entire arm.So far, the small/medium silicon band is much better and has 10 holes for better sizing and fit on my wrist. I will update once more when I confirm there are no circulation issues.",4
958,"The daily dashboard for the app using points, in lieu of raw data like calories and steps leaves a lot to be desired.  The tone of voice feature isn't really useful.  It's really nowhere near on par with Apple Health or Fitbit's apps.  Rethink this please HALO team!",3
959,"I work nights and sleep at two separate times during the day, 4-5 hours in the morning and 2-3 in the evening. The sleep tracker sees my entire daytime as sleep and the time I am awake between my sleeps is logged as a disturbance. I like the body scan. It's a real eye opener. I was going to set up and use the tone but after reading how much it drains the battery I decided against it. I bought a sport band which is much more comfortable than the one it comes with. Have not had any problems charging or not being able to sync to my phone. I've only had it for two weeks.",4
960,"The Halo has some very unique features (tone of voice, labs and body scan) yet somehow it is not keeping me engaged.  The battery life is very short so I find I'm having to charge it every night so I can't really utilize the sleep tracker or I have to give up a few hours of tracking during the day.Very limited bands right now since it is new.  The pink got dirty pretty quickly.  Also, the tracker is pretty bulky on top of your wrist.Overall, I like where they are going with this tracker but it feels like they crammed in a bunch of features that feel disconnected and not very rewarding from a tracker perspective.  I have a feeling that future versions of this will be refined and make this a much more useful product.  Unfortunately I am out a chunk of money now and have this thing laying around.",3
961,"I got this as a Christmas Gift for my sister. She loves it. The sleep tracking is her favorite aspect. She also likes the tone tracking but wishes it alters her in real time to the red or blue tones so she can adjust in real time. She says its hard to remember what/how she was saying and feeling by the time she goes back to look at the app. The battery lasts super long and although in tone mode the battery gets sucked up much faster it still lasts longer than many other smart watches. The feature I like the best is the weekly body scan, which I'd like to try for myself. So I will definitely be getting one. I am just super bummed I have to wait so long to get the one I want - the rose gold won't be available until April at the earliest and that makes me super sad because I am so pumped to get one of my own. Its super stylish and light so you can wear it with any other smart watch you have.",5
962,"I signed up for the early access because the voice tone analysis intrigued me. After about two days of playing with it I was ready to return it. It does a good enough job, but I wanted more. Alert me when my negative tone is more than x% in a day or something. The battery life is great, about 3 days — if you aren’t using always on tone analysis. Then you’ll be lucky to get 24 hours out of the battery. I really did not like the fitness points approach. I am a nursing mother so yeah, there’s going to be times that I am sedentary. There’s no way to compensate for this and no way to move your goal. I never got all the points in a week ever. Not having a clock on something you wear on your wrist is also annoying.  Overall I just like my Apple Watch better and returned my Halo.",3
963,"I have a very unique job and it requires me away from my phone for 12 hours.  I love that this band still tracks all of my steps and activity pretty accurately through my 12 hours. Alot of people complain about the point system for the body activity, but the watch is tracking your heart rate, which I love! I feel like it pushes me to push myself harder to keep my heart rate up for better results. The more I push myself the better I feel at the gym. It sucks seeing the point go away if I'm still too long, but it gives a better understanding of my daily life. Definitely would reccomend!",4
964,"I really like all of the information that it provides.  The body scan is super cool.  I'm looking forward to seeing that progress. I love that it synced super easily with the WW app. All I had to do was give it permission.I bought the silver and it's more gray than silver,  but it's still a good neutral color.Some others have said they found it bulky and couldn't get it to fit properly.  I have had zero problems with mine.  It's so light,  I hardly know it's there.  Although it is a bit thick,  I don't find it uncomfortable or cumbersome at all, just the opposite.",4
965,"This product looks excellent and was purchased with high hopes of providing a means of self-improvement.  Especially around the tone function and sleep tracker.  In theory it IS a great product.  But in execution it really lacks thus gets a one-star rating.  The product came to me and the instructions for set-up were clear and easy to follow.  It took about 10 minutes to unbox and get started but here are the issues.Immediately after getting connected to the app, I did the tone analysis just to see how it works.  In about a 5-minute conversation is showed I was “neutral” 95% of the conversation and positive 5%.  Pretty cool.Continued wearing the band all evening and went to bed.  Got up to see how the sleep tracking went but it refuses to stay connected to the app so that it can sync. It will connect briefly; say it is syncing and then throws a message that says, “double click band button to sync”.  After double clicking it quickly connects again then disconnects with another message that says “can’t update your info. Pull to refresh and try again”.  Then you pull to refresh, and it start all over again with the double click message.  It has been 19 hours (according to the apps last sync message) and I still cannot get the thing to receive the data.  This product will be returned by the end of the week.If you are looking to get your heartrate up by dealing with a product that seems to have gone to market to early, go ahead and buy.  But if you want something that does what it says, look elsewhere.",1
966,"I purchased the Halo in October 2020. Even though the product is ""swimproof,"" I always made sure to take it off in situations where it might become wet. Furthermore, I made sure to clean it and the band every week. I take care of my possessions. Nevertheless, when September 2021 rolled around, I discovered that the back cover of my Halo had popped off, and there was no easy fix. It looks like the seams, silicone, or rubber parts had warped. I'm not sure what circumstances caused this to happen, but I never left the device in extreme conditions. Unfortunately, the Return & Support Window already closed when I looked through my order, and I could not ask for assistance with the device.",3
967,"I was excited about trying this out, but I was quite underwhelmed with the results.The voice analysis was the greatest disappointment. It felt about as useful as a mood ring in many cases.  In others it just reminded me of the ""remember-all"" from Harry Potter. It told me I'd been angry at some point in the day, and I'm just sitting there thinking, ""apparently I was angry at some point, but why and when?"" I had no context to make the information useful.The sleep tracking was probably the most useful thing. It was neat getting a breakdown of my cycles of sleep.The health aspect was about as useful as most health wristbands in my experience,  which is to say, not very. I'd put it middle of the pack there. There are better options out there if that is the primary goal of the wristband.",3
968,I have loved my All app so much but am frustrated that it connects its data with hardly any other health apps (only two). I started using Noom and it doesn’t connect with that or my Apple Health app which makes it difficult to track my walking progress. As I work in a hospital I don’t have time to manually input data from my Halo band to my Apple Health app. I don’t want an Apple Watch because of too many notifications which is why the Halo band was perfect. Wish it was more versatile with other health apps.,3
969,"I purchased this item because I am tired of wearing my apple watch since I have several nice analog watches. I also have a healthcare plan that rewards my HSA with funds if I meet specific steps goals, so I need to track my steps. Unfortunately, because this item is so new the software is not able to pair to either the Apple Health App or the Virgin Pulse App. Without being able to sync my steps to that app I'm stuck wearing my apple watch still.Sleep tracking is accurate.Comfort is good, not bulky or too large on my wrist. Fabric band is soft and comfortable to wear at night.",4
970,"I have been using this band for about 3 months. This band does not pick up static workouts, like squats or arms. I just did a leg workout for 40 minutes and the band picked up 5 minutes of light activity.  It definitely picks up cardio based workouts and tracks sleep well. I also find that the band disconnects. You then have to reset the band and reinstall the app which can be annoying.I do wish it had a buzzer to remind you to walk around and perhaps a face for the time.I have not used the voice feature or body composition.",4
971,"I don’t like the silicone and synthetic bands of other brands, so when I saw that this was cloth and Amazon supported, I got one. I am allergic to metals, but have minimal metal on my skin and have been fine. I had to factory reset the band once in the first few weeks because it stopped responding to the app. The band and app require an ongoing subscription, which is not included in Prime. The app has some great connections to other programs, but I have to reset the reminders on a daily basis, not once like an alarm or reminder. I am still deciding if it is worth continuing to use, but the washable cloth band has been more comfortable than others I have used.",3
972,So I have bought maybe a half dozen of these over the years and sleeping is the one item I know people stop wearing the other is charge. If you have to charge it every day you’ll forget in in about a week. So far I’ve charged it 1. 4 days in and at 50%. The best thing is when I am sleeping I can sleep on my wrist and not feel some metal or box messing with me in the middle of a toss or turn.Over all this is a great band. I know some people like to wear it for the watch but I have a beautiful Seiko watch and I though it look corny wearing 2 watches. So the band looks like a punk rock bracket.That could be the style. If I could get them to watch my shoes or shirts. Because changing the band was by far the second easiest thing to do. The first was pairing and setup to my phone. Apple if you need to know. I like it it a lot,5
973,"I had early access to the Halo so I had to try it out. I am a larger girl and I HATE how fitness bands look on my wrist, even my apple watch felt so bulky and screams ""I'm on a diet."" I hate it. I liked that halo has no screen, and seems like just a plain black band on my wrist. Easy and lowkey, no screen blinking how many steps I've taken. I like that it has an extensive battery life- several days without Tone detection. I haven't tried tone yet, because I bought this for steps and sleep tracking. If you lay in bed awake, it may still count you as asleep, as it has done for me one night, but otherwise I am impressed, it seems accurate, it's easy and I never really realize I have it on. Comfortable and therefore, something I will actually use. Mobile app still has a way to go, I think they could improve things but It's nothing that turns me off now. Maybe fitness challenges would be cool, like how you close rings on apple.",5
974,"I have been wearing my Halo band since mid November. I started with the cloth band that it came with, and after a month I decided to buy the silicone one in hopes it would be more comfortable. I am constantly having to slide the band back up over my wrist bones (this happens with both of them), and I now have a strange red mark that looks and feels like scar tissue where the band tends to rest when it slides. I love the concept of this, but it is just so uncomfortable for me. I love the sleep tracking, heart rate, and tracking my steps (I’m a busy stay at home mom and apparently I take between 15,000-20,000 steps in my home each day!), but honestly, now with this strange mark in my wrist... I’m not really sure I’m comfortable wearing this at all anymore. It’s really irritating my skin.",3
975,"Like all things, this too has its pros and cons. I enjoy the fact that the mobile app is convenient and easy to understand. I enjoy the voice analysis aspect as well as the body scan element. I have worn it in the ocean and didn't had any problems. I wear it to bed but I don't believe that the sleep analysis is 100% accurate.  Additionally,  charging Halo can be a bit cumbersome. If its not setting exactly right, the device won't charge. If you use the voice analysis, it drains the battery life significantly. I used it early on but then decided to turn it off simply for the sake of the battery life. So in conclusion,  being I did get it at a special introductory price then its ok to use. However, I'm not convinced I would purchase it at regular price knowing everything that I do now.",3
976,"I love my halo. I have used it for over a year now and the data it collects has prompted me to create healthier habits. My fiancé now has one too and we love to compare and “compete” together.  I only wish there were cuter band designs like for other fitness trackers. Other than that, I think it’s great!",5
977,"I like that it doesn't have a screen, no distractions, but it failed after months.",3
978,"What I like about the band is how accurate the sleep tracker is in comparison to my Fit it Versa 2 and Samsung Galaxy 3. It is a good health tracker. The downside is, I wish it works as a watch as well. I need to be able to see the time, even if I don't see step tracker and everything else. Otherwise, you'd have to wear another device for time keeping purposes. The band definitely needs improvement to catch up with the competition but it has its pros and cons like everything else.",4
979,"the only complaint I have is the light colored bands show dirt too easily.. Would like a greater choice of colors for the bands.  I am going to have to place an order for darker colored bands, so more money spent.  this works well, is very helpful in tracking my sleep patterns, and I love that it easily counts my steps and calories burned.",5
980,"I was gifted this tracker recently and it is game changing! I have been working out regularly, but since using the tracker it has helped me up my fitness routine. The more you move, the more points you earn which game-ifies working out and makes it a fun challenge. There are tons of professional workout and mindfulness videos to use for a really affordable price in my opinion. It's comfortable, easy to sleep in, and charges up quick! I have set schedules for the tone feature and my battery usually lasts three days. The data feels accurate and really helps you keep track of what you're burning on a daily basis. Ignore the hate comments, I would 100% recommend this tracker to anyone, young or old. If you want to start moving your body more and keep track of your progress, this is a perfect way to get started. It's all about finding the motivation and this tracker is definitely motivating!",5
981,"The band was comfortable to wear, especially after a few days.The app is really cool, tons of workouts and recipes that you can save.I wasn't a fan of tone it just tells you how you sounded at a moment during the day. The battery life is much longer if you don't use it.The body scan is basically a 3d picture of how you look with your bmi and body fat % whether they're actually legit I have no clue. It's really not much different than if you were to take weekly progress pictures.I wanted something to track steps, sleep, and workouts which this does.It does a good job of tracking active moments. I was worried when there wasn't a place to actually start or log a workout but this does a great job of tracking based off of movement, heart rate etc.Overall I love thus purchase.",5
982,"Overall I like the Halo band but the app sucks!!  I’ve done all of the updates but it takes forever for the app to update then it closes unexpectedly!  I reopen it and it didn’t save the update and then it closes again!  It closes 5-6 times every time I open the app to see how many points I have which turns out to be about 20 times a day because I like to check my progress throughout the day.  VERY FRUSTRATING!!I like the activity section of the band and feel like that is accurate but I question the accuracy of the sleep section.  When I add up the hours the band is usually off by an hour.  If they don’t fix the app then the band isn’t worth it!!UPDATE-it’s been 2 years that I’ve been using Halo, only had minimal issues the first year and mainly with the app.  The second year has been annoying because I’ve had to unpair and re-pair the device about 6 times!!  One day it calculated 800 activity points which I’m not sure is even possible!  You start with 150 points a week.  It won’t sync with the app again today so I will have to unpair and re-pair it with the app  again!  Time to look for a new fitness tracker!",2
983,"I love the app and the features like tone and sleep tracking but what kills the device for me is the inaccuracy of the heart rate monitor.  I've gone cycling with it halo on one wrist and the Apple Watch in the other. For Some reason the HR is always off in the first 10-20 minutes and can be off by as much as 30-80 beats per minute. Its almost like its unsure if I'm working out and it decides it would rather be conservative in the readings.After 10-20 minutes its starts to track my HR similar to the Apple Watch like it begrudgingly agrees I'm working out.I love the device and the app and I'd look at it all the time but at the end of the day, if the readings are off then its just a toy. I can't recommend this as it is right now",3
984,"The accuracy of the activity tracking seems to lowball what’s going on... then again maybe you get a an extra if you confirm you’re working out to one of their offered subscription programs as opposed to on your own. It definitely wasn’t giving me more “points” for taking the stairs (much less skipping every other one)The sleep tracking did seem a little better.The whole body composition feature claiming to  be more accurate also felt very debatable. It really didn’t feel like it’s results were any different than staring at a BMI chart despite their promoted claims saying otherwise.I would’ve gave it 3 stars overall... but upon upgrading my phone, I discovered that it no longer recognized my account and wanted me to start from scratch. I get the concern for privacy and for many folks that is a top priority. But not to have a better way of upgrading other than a factory reset is a joke. I’m now struggling to reset the setting and cancel so it doesn’t just continue billing me for subscription services that I can’t use or progress it won’t save.If it brings back my other stored data it had recorded from the last few months (whenever I do finally resolve the current issue) -I may adjust my review accordingly...but right now buyer’s remorse is steering this train towards the nearest cliff.",2
985,It works well the velcro strap is a game changer for these things working correctly. I didn't realize this untill the view came out and once I got it; I realized it had a fixed placement band. This has led to inconsistent tracking because I can't get the right tightness. Game changer fully adjustable band game ruinner they went to a fixed band for the newest version and are selling the velcro band for 30 dollars.If you are considering between the two I'm sure they both work in similar fashion but the fact they force you to buy a proper fitting band for the view is a reason I'd say get the original halo over view. If they change that and send me the proper band I'll edit the review but still the screen isn't worth the headache at this time.,5
986,"Love the design and simplicity of set-up.  I have the silver band in size small.  This thing was ready to use pretty much right out of the box, and is very user-friendly.  Additionally, it is surprisingly comfortable, so that after my first day of wearing it, I didn’t even think about it.  So far, my favorite features are the heart rate monitor and the sleep tracking. Those are very beneficial for me, and seem to be extremely accurate.  The sleep tracking fascinates me, and I can pinpoint the trouble makers that disrupt my sleep.  Additionally, while I have mixed emotions as to the usefulness and my comfort level with the tone monitoring feature, it also fascinates me.  I do think it could help with mindfulness if I track my overall tone, and also help me plan important conversations, etc. around my most optimistic, energetic part of the day.  So far, I love my Halo band, and am still testing out all of its features, like the meditation lab and body scanning for body-fat analysis.",5
987,I really like this device. It had everything I wanted and more with no distracting screen. It lasted almost exactly 6 months and the back fell off when I took it off to charge it. I didn't buy the warranty (though I don't know if that would have covered it) so they can't do anything and I will no longer have my Halo.,4
988,"I wanted to check this out thinking it would be really great.  However it's a little over the top with the tone of voice and that sort of thing.  Not really useful.  I wanted something better for health, not a big brother that scolds me for how I talk.It's really a little bit over the top / jumping the shark I think.  Body composition, activity, sleep etc are good - but it's a little too much with the other features.I also realized that I need at least a watch / time display when wearing a device on my arm.  I got used to that with FitBit and other devices.  Just having a blank band is a little weird.Also the subscription costs are a little bit of a negative.Not ready for ""prime"" time if you ask me.",3
989,"I wanted to love this product but it is AWFUL! So incredibly inaccurate, that it is shocking! I am an extremely active individual. I do a brisk 3 mile, one hour walk with my dogs daily! This Halo device tells me I am walking two miles at best! Halo band is only giving me 65% credit for calories and steps! After doing a dog walk I typically follow it up with an intense cardio dance, PiYo Drench or P90X Core workout. These workouts are typically an hour. Again, low calorie count! I can only compare these numbers with my Apple Watch and my Fitbit Versa Lite’s numbers from the last three years! Halo is incredibly off by 200 calories per activity in the deficit! I have tracked my 3 miles by car and yes it’s 3 miles but Halo says it’s only 2 and I’m in the deficit by 150-175 calories! Whereas, Fitbit and Apple Watch were completely comparable with data Halo is completely inaccurate! I typically burn 2500 calories a day according to my intense activity for my 5’ 125 pound figure according to Versa and Apple Watch for the last 3 years. With Halo I’m ending my day with 1800 calories! Something is completely off! The one thing it seems to be accurate with is my zone minutes, which is a recommended 150 points a week! I track an average of about 120 a day which is completely accurate given my activity! So explain to me how I am getting high and accurate zone points a day and the calorie and step count are extremely low? Totally irritating and defeating. I do not recommend this product because of its blatant inaccuracies!",1
990,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS TRACKER! I really enjoy that it doesn’t have a screen. It doesn’t distract me or make me feel I’m not doing whatever I should be. It provides data and that is what I’m searching for. It does have the live heart rate tracker so I can check that on my phone. Love the sleep portion, it is comfortable to wear at night. I usually just charge it when I take a shower and that’s enough. I hope Amazon keeps this in the current format because I DO NOT want a screen. Love love love this and I couldn’t recommend it higher.I will say I wish the app had a place where I could keep track of my weight that I take on a scale.",5
991,"I've been trying to synch for the last hour.  This is not unusual with the Halo.  There needs to be some major upgrade on the device to resolve this huge short coming.  Otherwise, it is a very reasonably priced and fairly useful wearable.  I like the sleep monitor.  I like the fitness points to account for all your activity (I average 500-600 points whereas 150 is the recommendation so I guess I'm pretty active) as well as sedentary time.  Specific body composition tips and movement assessment is also useful.  Fix the synch and I'd give it a solid 4 or 4.5.",3
992,"I've owned the device for a few days now and already have had to restart it several times, re-connect it to my phone, and it still only synchs about half the times I open the app.  I'm hoping, for Amazon's sake, it is just a bad single device and not a systemic issue.  I got the device because a friend told me it better captured weightlifting as opposed to other devices.  My one regret, and it's on me for not better understanding, is it doesn't give a ""readiness"" score like many other devices.  As for positives...I do love the size of the device.  I want to continue wearing an analog watch on my dominant hand and wear a fitness device on my dominant hand, so the small size is perfect (although an upper arm strap or ankle strap would be great).  I found it does a great job on sleep tracking.I was torn between a 2 star and three, but the constant non-synching and having to reboot multiple times in the few days I've owned it leads me to the 2-star review.",2
993,"Update after a month of use: First, I purchased this for my wife, and at first, she had issues with battery life. Now, she's getting 7 days and there's usually still some juice left, so she's happy. She likes that it keeps track of steps, sleep, etc. and has been overall impressed. Plus, I don't have to worry about us needing to replace a smartwatch screen, since it's not actually a smartwatch... Ultimately, it does what it say's, and worth the cost compared to some of the pricier smartwatches.I left the original review below, which was 1 star.Original Review: Will update in time, but after a full charge on Christmas Eve, and using one night and one morning, the battery was already dead. I have 2 Android Wear watches in my household and both get at least two days without needing to be charged. Why would something with fewer sensors than what my watch has, without any screen, be dead in less than 12 hours?",5
994,"i love my band! before my purchase, a lot of the reviews complaining about the point system worried me because they were saying its so hard for them to get points etc. which was fine because i wasnt buying it for that! however i quickly found that the point system is my favorite part of the band and the app. if you wear your band all the time as i do, the points arent actually hard to collect! i find myself collecting 600+ points a week compared to the 150 goal.the band itself feels awkward on the wrist at first, but after adjusting it a few times and finding the fit i like on my wrist is does not bother me. yes it leaves a light mark on your wrist, but that didnt bother me personally either.overall a great product, would definitely recommend paying for the app subscription because the point system is just that fun!",5
995,"I'd love to love this little thing, which I got for Christmas. It's provided some insights, and it's fun to track exercise. It's very insightful about sleep - but the big limit is that it doesn't always know when you're asleep. If you wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, the device may or may not register that you go back to sleep. So over time, the insights are limited.",3
996,"I purchased the halo original watch, without the face numbers, because I like the idea of it not being readable by other people. I did purchase the newer one with the numbers on the face of the watch, but I have not used it yet. I will use it as soon as I know I can trance port all of the old medical information to the new watch.",5
997,"The halo band worked as advertised! It seemed to be acurate with readings. I compared it with other devices andthe readingswere consistent...as far as heart rate, sleep cycle, steps taken, etc. Then one day it just stopped working. I tried all the troubleshooting but nothing worked. So, from my experience the band isn't durable. I expect a device like this to last over 6 months, but mine didn't.",3
998,I like the Halo band quite a bit while it was working. From the very beginning it was quirky and sometimes a pain in the backside.All I have ever done is a regular normal person workout and shower with it. Now it will not accept a charge.Band is clean. Cable is fine. Charger unit never moves from the counter in the breakfast nook.I guess I will move on to something more reliable.Very disappointed with the product overall,3
999,"Everything was great until month 10 when the Halo died and refused to turn back on again. I was lucky enough that it died in month 10 and not month 13 where it would have been out of warranty.Amazon refused to replace it, but after an hour and four different representatives from customer service (had to escalate to a supervisor), they finally agreed to refund me on return. They first tried to lie to me and said it only had a 90 day warranty. I had to copy and paste the Amazon site which clearly says the warranty is one year before they agreed to the refund.To be clear, the band has a one year warranty. The reps will try to convince you that you are out of warranty and therefore not entitled to a return or exchange. A simple online search for ""Amazon Halo warranty"" will bring up the page  that shows the one year warranty. Don't let them lie you out of your refund. It's pretty clear that the prior customer focus that made Amazon who they are is no longer the case.I understand that these days things come with a planned obsolescence, but 10 months puts it in the category of disposable. $100 is way to much to pay for a disposable device.The software is nice and the partnership with multiple exercise coaching systems is nice. However, it all becomes pointless with a dead band.I might try Fitbit instead which has better durability. Had Amazon agreed to replace the band, things might have been different. But as of now, I definitely do not recommend purchasing this band",1
1000,"This band has been glitchy from the get-go and I would avoid it like the plague. I bought my band in November because a friend had just done the same and we work out together. From the beginning the band showed serious inconsistency in the number of steps, some really unreliable heart rates. And several nights where it did not record any sleep at all. I wear the band the same way every single day so I know that is not the problem. I have called Amazon customer support no less than three times and they have suggested all the usual stuff of rebooting the band and doing a firmware upgrade. Now that I’m near the end of the Warranty. And this band is still glitching out they want me to settle for a refurbished band that some other loser sent back in LOLMy advice is if you buy one and see any hints of problems with it, don’t delay in contacting Amazon. They’re actually very easy to call although they are pretty much powerless to help you since they are busy helping Jeff Bezos get them to space. But at least there will be a pattern and maybe you can get a new replacement.",2
1001,Not real comfortable to wear and not as comprehensive as I hoped. Great idea and look but man is it uncomfortable! The metal unit that sits on your wrist does not flex whatsoever and the proper placement has it digging into my bone even when I can slide a finger under the band. My other problem is I was hoping it would give me more comprehensive information about my sleep and it seems to give me even less information than my Apple Watch does. Maybe in a year or two I will  see if they enable to read things a bit more accurately and it’ll be worth it but for me I’ll stick with my Apple Watch now.,3
1002,"I received an ""early purchase offer"" email from Amazon about their new oroduct, Halo. I was intrigued and purchased it based on the ""voice recognition tone"" feature.  I thought it would be really helpful and it might be IF it ever recognized me talking, laughing, crying or anything. I hardly ever get tone readings. And yes, I make sure my mic is turned on.  This band is basically an over rated activity tracker and I'm not even sure that's accurate. I should gave returned it within the 90 days, but I kept wanting to give it another chance.  Should have given up on it long ago...waste of money.  Plus I really dislike where it has to sit on your wrist and how tight it feels after the end of the day, but I don't remove it because it does track my sleep properly.",3
1003,"I ordered this band early July 2021, and now it's February 2022. I love it! It is so motivating. When I first got my band I was barely getting 150 points a week. After a couple months I started eating better and every week I was getting 300 points. Then I decided to go to the gym, 600 points a week. 8 months later here I am with over 1,000 points a week!I wake up at 6:30, go to the gym before work, I am a dog groomer so I stand alot at my table with minimum walking, after work I walk my dog and clean the house. I am so much more productive and I feel so much happier. Thank you Halo!",5
1004,"It seems to track sleep and activity fairly well, and the battery life is perfectly fine, as long as you don't use the Tone feature. Which you shouldn't because it's useless. The body seems like a gimmick, too, but if it's accurate, I guess it could end up being useful to some people. I have no way to confirm if it's accurate or not, however, so your mileage may vary. The app is mediocre but easy enough to navigate. I haven't tried any of the extra programs in the thing, so I can't speak to those. I have zero intention of keeping the subscription, after the trial runs out. Basically, I got exactly what I looking for; a reasonably cheap, reasonably accurate activity and sleep tracker. I wouldn't have paid the full freight for it, but I got it for the intro price, so it can stick around.",3
1005,"So I tried. I wanted this to work , I really did. I don't feel like paying for a Whoop strap each month, and this looked like a great alternate.So I will say this. The sleep tracking worked great for 2 weeks. It synced up and seemed to be pretty true to how I sleep.The voice tracking never seemed to work...and I wasn't all too worried about that feature anyway.The body scan was neat, but again I think it was off based on what i know of prior scans at my gym. So I wasn't too worried. A neat way to track progress though. However, you could just take some before and after shots and it is the same thing.The biggest issues I had were:1.) the fitness tracking I wore this band all the time. Doing CrossFit, splitting wood, walking, chores, coaching soccer. You would think the most high intensity numbers I would receive each week would be from CrossFit. However that was not the  case. Most workouts would give me 2-3 points, where coaching a game of soccer gave me 50 points one game. So something is off.2.) It just stopped syncing with my phone and I couldn't get it to sync back up. I charged. I reset. I did everything...so I returned it.Not sure it is worth the investment.",2
1006,"Fitness tracker still have a few things that need to be improved and until I have given up on wearing it. Halo as designed is good for weightlifting compared to other bulky wearables. It does however not recognize or log the workout. Even if I start with a jump rope or a little cardio and my heart rate is btw 110&150 for an hour or so I still have to manually enter it. When I go for a walk or run the tracker picks it up and logs it appropriately. The heart rate while weightlifting is not steady, it goes up and down with your sets and that seems to be tricking the tracker. This causes me to manually log all exercises and with that I am now tracking time, and not getting consistant results from device.Sleep tracking is ok and I hardly notice that I am wearing it. I do not use the tone analyzer as it drains the batteries too fast.One weird thing is that in the morning commute it logs me at extreme heartrates for 10 minutes, but I am just driving and dropping of kids. No strain, no noticable activity or heartrate, certainly not 170, picking up some nonesense, not sure what but now i have to delete activity that never happened.",2
1007,"I have worn an Oura Ring for 2 years and have tried various fitness wrist devices. The ring is great, but no wrist wearables ever felt right...from Whoop to Apple Watch to a few other brands. I had low expectations for the Halo, but it’s blown me away in every way. The low key and comfort aspect of it is great, you forget it’s there which is particularly important when you sleep.The app and the interface are simple, beautiful and elegant. They show just the right amount of information. Relevant, intuitive and well explained.I’ve compared readings with an iFit band, a cuffed BP monitor and the Oura Ring and the Halo is super accurate so far with HR (heart rate) monitoring and sleep tracking data.The voice recognition and the BMI tracking work very well and are welcome additions beyond the basic functions.This is definitely a keeper for me and I am as picky as they get.",5
1008,"User friendly app. Is it perfect, of course not. Is it AS good as more expensive smart watches, yes…and without the annoyance of a watch face and a vibrating wrist every time a call or text comes through. The voice analyzing feature will eat your battery quickly, but if there’s sort of thing interests you, it’s pretty fun to follow.",5
1009,"I use this band only for sleep and activity tracking, and will only comment on it's ability for doing these tasks.This is the most comfortable tracker I've used, among Garmin, Fitbit, Mi Band and probably a couple others. They really made it feel like it's not there, and I really like the fabric/Velcro band, easy to put on but very strongly attached during rigorous activity. Sleep tracking is ok, it works most of the time but I question how accurate it is at telling me how much I'm supposedly awake during the night. Activity tracking is also just ok, it records only steps, no distance estimation, but it's a good ballpark. Overall this is still the best option for me for an ""all-day"" tracker that I never have to remove other than showering (note I do switch wrists every couple weeks to prevent it from irritating my skin from covering it all the time).",5
1010,"It's the next best thing to Whoop.  I've never had a fitness band, as everyone I knew who had one was out of shape, and everyone I trained with at the gym didn't have one.  That may be changing with this new generation of bands.  Whoop seems great bit way too expensive for what it offers.  Enter Halo.  This gem delivers truly useful data like recovery/sleep and body fat readings which honestly are (for me) damn near spot on.  As a bodybuilder I have caliper and BodPod (air displacement) readings for body fat regularly a d I was amazed at how accurate this Halo band was using pictures.  What a great tool.  DEFINITELY worth $100 and a couple bucks a month.  I don't really use the tone/voice info.  I very much appreciate NOT having a display on the band.  It would be a distraction.",5
1011,"Update: it stopped syncing. Glad it wasn't crazy expensive but feels like a total waste of good money. Very disappointing.Original review: I bought this product 4 months ago and this is the first fitness tracker I have bought. I got it for a few reasons: fitness tracker, tone for talking with others, and body mass indicator. These were the main reasons. It tracks sleep but I can not tell if it impacts my quality of life. The tone tracking is mostly neutral for me and I probably already knew that if I thought about it. The fitness tracker part is really nice bc I get a better idea of actual activity. Now, the body scan is less than be desired. I think lighting and phone placementplay a larger role than I would have thought; especiallylightingbc it can give shadows. I have tried it twice. Most recently with an eight (8) pound decrease in my weight from 135 to 127 and it says that I gained over 2% body fat which seems ridiculous since I am exercising like always but reduced my food intake.  It should have lowered my body fat. I did try a scale that can measure body fat based on weight and it was more accurate bc I out me between 24% and 27%.  This part of the Halo is definitely a thumbs down.  I would have given it a 3.5 star value but that was not an option so put it st 3. I do not use all the other stuff on the app - maybe if I did not work then I would have more time to get familiar with all the other items.  I will probably cancel my membership after the 6 months since I don't get enough out of it.",1
1012,"During the time when I was wearing this throughout the day, including sleeping hours, I kept having headaches. I also felt unrest after a night’s sleep.It could be just me but thought to post this anyway.Because of the short time I have with this watch, I can’t comment much on functionality though I loved the integration with the mobile app. It seemed to do what it first advertised.",3
1013,"I know it's a little slim with functionality now, but aesthetically this band is 100% my jam, and it's comfortable to wear in literally all situations for me. The tough love vibes of docking points for being sedentary with the feature labs suggestions for improvement is the kind of motivation that works for me. I work better under pressure/with a certain amount of anxiety and apprehension. The tone stuff is fun but a little gimmicky, but I think it's been pretty accurate as far as my state when I'm speaking. I could see the features being a challenge or upsetting for some, so I would suggest weighing your preferences against what this band has been critiqued for.Creepy features: considering you can turn off the microphone and opt out of body composition tracking, it doesn't have to be? Even with security measures to obfuscate my online activities, Amazon already knows pretty much everything I buy, my lifestyle and my habits. I've picked my tech overlords and hope Skynet appreciates my restrained neutrality. o7",5
1014,"Not ready to buy an Apple watch or another multi-hundred dollar fitness tracker, when Amazon announced their Halo band I though it hit the sweet spot for a fitness tracker and I could still keep my reliable Casio A-158 watch. It is going on ten years and as the old Timex ad said; Took a licking and still ticking. Wearing two wrist bands is a hassle sometimes but it works. Well, like the old maxim; You get what you pay for... the Amazon Halo band does little for me other than tell me I got a good nights sleep, track my heart rate and that I need to do more walking. The app does not function on two devices and being able to track something like email and security cameras with my phone, computer and tablet are important to me. I don't like being a slave to the cellphone. The more advanced fitness bands track some functions that are important to maintaining good health. With the EKG function on some of them, they will tell you if you might be having a heart attack. Glucose monitoring would also be nice but that is still in the trial stages with fitness bands. Tone of voice does little for me.  Who cares if you only talk to pets? Sometimes they will listen to you.",2
1015,"This is an excellent tracker for those wishing for basic information. I think it's a great investment for those starting exercise regiments. The band itself is very small and light, and I hardly notice it after I put it on. The sleep tracker could be better, as I've had a few nights where the band has ""shifted"" and it couldn't give me any information other than how maybe how long I slept. The body fat composition is pretty neat, and very accurate. I can't comment on the voice measurement, as I don't have it turned off. All in all, I think it's pretty great and look forward to future updates and improvements.",4
1016,"The sleep tracking, calories burned, and heart rate are great. The heart rate on Halo was identical to hospital’s rate.The steps and activities are not good. My Apple Watch is much more accurate. The activities are suspect because of the low step count and penalties are very discouraging. Give credit and make suggestions instead of penalties.",5
1017,"I’m comparing the Halo to the Fitbit Alta HR.Halo Pros:  The voice tone analysis, body scan, and cloth band.  The voice tone analysis and body scans are features unique to Halo that I enjoy using.Halo Cons:  The app doesn’t allow you to modify any of the stats.  The biggest problem is the sleep analysis.  I often wake up multiple times in the night and sometimes take 30-40 minutes to fall back to sleep.  The app will complete my sleep analysis and not count the extra hour or so I slept after waking up.  I would like to be able to change the time to my actual sleep time.  The battery is also not great.  I have to charge Halo every 48hrs, where the battery life of my fitbit lasts about 6 days.  The Halo does charge faster, but not significantly.  I would also like to have some sort of step indicator directly on the halo band rather than go directly into the app.  Another feature I like about the fitbit are the vibration alerts.Overall a good first attempt from Amazon, but it definitely needs more work to compete with other fitness trackers.  I would give it a solid C+.",2
1018,"Android Users: I haven't seen much reviews on mobile phone capability so this is for Android/ Samsung users. My friend with an iPhone has a Amazon Halo Band and everything seems to be working fine so I decided to try it. First off mine was only charged at 2% when I received it. My friend's was at 60% and most reviews say the same. Following ALL the instructions per booklet. Mine took hours to actually start tracking. I have a Samsung Galaxy S20 a more than adequate enough device per Halo requirements. When it finally started tracking it tracked steps and live voice but no heart rate or normal voice data. After a few hard resets per instruction booklet. It finally tracked heart rate, voice and steps. Through the night dealt with back & forth connection errors. Finally started tracking again. Went to bed and woke up with no sleep tracking. Again everything disconnected and so on and so on. I've performed ALL troubleshooting per Halo recommendations and as vague as it is. Nothing still worked. That's more than 10 strikes for me. Two stars for a great idea but needs to be more compatible with Android users as well. Even the box says ""Made for iPhone"" with a logo then in small print basically ""oh yeah Android too"". Good start Amazon but needs major work. Good luck Y'all!",2
1019,"Overall, I guess amazon gets points for trying. The watch tries to occupy a niche between smartwatches and calorie based activity trackers like fitbit. But it has a long way to go before it gets to be a good one.The two good things it has going for it is a very nice body composition meter which helps visualize fat and a nice unobtrusive interface. No time, no other features, nothing. Its sleep tracking is great.But everything else is fail. Maybe if you are a WW member it works better. But it does not play well with other apps. It struggles with tone if you are from cultures with faster or vastly more measured languages. Every conversation of mine in an Indian language or Spanish was deemed angry. All conversations in Japanese was deemed hesitant. My English convos were deemed confident. Even when the nature of my convos were the same.The labs are disappointing. They sound great in theory, for example - let us restrict your carbs. But the tracking is ""did you count your carbs?- yes/no. I don't need  an app for that.I am glad I tried it and I know they will build on it. But as it stands, unless you are into one of their specific partner programs, I do not see what additional value it brings.",2
1020,I really love this halo band does what it’s post to do I use for walking and sleeping and exercise,5
1021,"One of the primary reasons I wanted this was to help track my fitness/exercise/workouts.Heart rate tracking is useless, and the basis for how it calculates your ""points"". I can jump on the elliptical and as I start to build up speed and intensity, the heartrate DROPS on the Halo. I've tried loosening the band, tightening the band, inside the wrist, outside the wrist, farther up the arm, closer to the hand and all possible combinations.Same when lifting weights, or most of the other workout activities I do. I've spent almost as much time futzing with this thing for the last week as I have actually working out, and am now admitting defeat. Returning it for a refund.The app help section actually says it cannot track your heart rate when working out!""You may see inaccurate heart rate values when you frequently clench your fist - such as during HIIT, weight lifting, and functional fitness activities"".I guess grabbing the elliptical handle falls in this category, and my guess would be a bicycle might also. It also states the activities with lots of arm movement like washing dishes will greatly increase the recorded steps, and something like pushing a stroller will decrease the recorded steps due to lack of arm movement.It may work as is for some, but useless for me.",2
1022,i’ve been using this for almost a month great i’ve charged it 3 times without it ever getting to 0% does everything do well it’s so simple beats the amazfit wich is the only competitor when i got it for 50$ I like how the band just is simple people say it invaded privacy it does not also the body fat scan is extremely accurate.,5
1023,"I love this watch, it’s EXTREMELY lightweight which makes for easy wear day and night. The fact that it doesn’t have the time on it has thrown me off a bit but I’m enjoying not having my phone calls and texts connected so I’m not so worried about what’s going on in the cellular world. The activity aspect of it has been way more useful then an Apple Watch and I really enjoy the sleep calculator. The way it calculates your exercise seems to be way more accurate then a fit bit and Apple Watch. Now let’s talk about the BATTERY, this baby STAYS CHARGED annnndddd it takes like 20 minutes to get a full charge so it’s super easy to charge once a week.The one thing I would change is the tone feature. The idea was really awesome but I don’t think Amazon pulled this one off. It’s just not super accurate and drains the battery faster for no reason. I now use it muted and like it’s other features over the tone anyway.Highly recommend this!!",5
1024,"The feedback feature is not as useful as it needs to be.  getting a report at the end of the day that you've not shown enthusiasm is just depressing, not actionable.  The device needs a feedback mechanism so I can evolve the way I sound to others.The battery was a problem at first, requiring less than daily charging.  I changed the feedback mechanism or it reset or something and now it's every day and a half to two days.  The charging mechanism is nice.The sleep tracking is sometimes useful.  I had one night where it said I went to bed at 1 a.m., which I'm not capable of.  Sometimes I sleep 5.5 hours a night and this doesn't think that's long enough to rate.  Another issue is I use an Apnea machine and there should be something that accounts for that in the app.",3
1025,"You'll hear and read good and bad things about the Halo, but for my experience, it has been only positive. The activity tracker gives me an incentive to move (who wants to lose points?!) every day. I like the sleep tracker, but not sure I completely trust its accuracy yet but it has improved since the first day I received it. What I do especially love is the labs offered for sleep. I use them nightly and have found them so helpful and believe they have improved my sleep. This is my first tracker, but I am so glad I chose Halo. There are some improvements that can be made, for sure. The labs on exercise are difficult to do on my phone, for example, so ideally there will one day be a way to put it on a larger screen. It's best to see Halo not as a fitness tracker, but a lifestyle tracker. I use the Tone feature only for giggles. That said, I 100 percent use Halo every day and have been very happy I bought one.",5
1026,"I absolutely love the Halo. It’s by far my favorite fitness tracker I’ve owned! The step counter seems to be very accurate. I have found the activity tracker and the way it uses points to track your weekly activity to be extremely motivating and eye-opening. I LOVE the sleep tracker and the fact that it offers you suggestions on how to better your sleep. I quickly discovered I was getting way too much REM sleep and was able to find ways to correct it and have been feeling much better during the day. The band is not bulky, is stylish and I can’t even feel that it’s on my wrist once I got used to it.I wasn’t thrilled about the Tone feature. I found that it drained my battery to the point I was having to charge it every day rather than once a week, but with the click of a button I was easily able to turn that feature off.Overall, I would highly recommend for anyone who is looking for a simple, quality activity tracker.",5
1027,"I have been wearing mine for three weeks now.  It is lightweight and barely noticeable.  It just seems like so much more work than other trackers.  It is there... but I can't look at it for info.  I have to open my phone to gage my workout.  The data seems very accurate and I like the way the app is set up.  It is just strange to look down and not have anything to read.  Still working with it, and hope to get into a good routine with it.  I don't dislike it, just not sure if I love it.",4
1028,I love the fact that this doesn't have a screen or a display. The tracking has been spot on and the voice tone recognition has been great as well. The app is doing exactly what it is designed for and I enjoy the BMI features and suggestions. The main issue I have with this is where on your arm it is suggested to wear it which is two fingers above your wrist bone. I assume this is for accuracy reasons and I get that. I do believe it has been more accurate than my fit bits (have had many) were and more convenient than using your phone for tracking steps and whatnot.,4
1029,"This tracker is perhaps the most inaccurate unit I've ever owned. I purchased it primarily for step counting and sleep tracking, and it failed miserably on both counts.My steps are consistently overcounted by at least 20% compared to other trackers worn on the same wrist. I'm a Senior Citizen, and although I'm active, I do NOT average over 20,000 steps a day.The sleep tracking is abysmal. It shows my reading time before bed as trying to fall asleep, and most nights it shows me awake from exactly Midnight until 1 AM. The combination of these two things gives me a terrible ""sleep score"".I do not sleepwalk, nor are my awake times that punctual. This is clearly a software issue.The battery life is absolutely terrible. Their 'solution' is to top off the battery daily.Really?The app features aren't too bad, but the ""Labs"" do absolutely nothing for me. I cancelled my membership 2 months in, even though it was free.I purchased this to replace my 'Bit when that company was sold (I didn't trust my privacy would be maintained), but after trying it for nearly 3 months, I'm giving up in favor of a G--min, which has proved to be *much* more accurate.I gave it two stars only because I liked the look of it.",2
1030,"I used my device for six weeks before returning it to Amazon.  The app offers little value and makes it difficult to find your data among all of the ""suggested content"" that is rarely relevant.My complaints:- Wildly inaccurate as a fitness tracker.  Used it on three hikes on my right wrist along with a Garmin Fenix 6 on my left and an iPhone in my pocket.  Garmin and Apple were within 8% of each other.  Halo was consistently >40% higher.- Body composition is inaccurate.  It's cool, but also had significant variance with a Withings smart scale and my doctor's Tanita.  The Tanita and the Withings were within 0.2% over six weeks.  The Halo would be above or below them by 3-4% of body fat.- Poor battery life.  You cannot have it monitor tone during the day AND wear it as a sleep tracker at night.  Just not enough power.- Shifty subscription model.  I've been in an online chat with a very nice person in India for over an hour trying to cancel the membership.  They don't know what it is.  But contacting customer service is the ONLY way to end the subscription.  Have you ever tried getting a human at Amazon?Finally,- Jeff finds out before you do.  It's not really your data.  It's Amazon's.  If you are using the device somewhere without internet coverage your phone will not sync with the device.  That's right., even though it communicates with Bluetooth to your phone, you can't even see your current step count unless it can connect to Amazon's servers and upload your data before it presents on the device.  Insert all the profanity here.TLDR: low-grade hardware, even worse software",1
1031,"I bought this for the sleep and tone analyses. Both are good but could use some refining. I have compared the tone reading with others with whom I was meeting. There are issues that require interpretation within context. For instance, we were spit-balling ideas and Halo recorded the interaction as ""worried.""The sleep analysis is a little more problematic. There are times when I am lying on the couch or bed reading or on my phone and Halo records it as sleep. Then I get up and move around for a while. That's interpreted as interrupted sleep.All-in-all it's good but needs some tweaking.",4
1032,"I like this Halo a lot. I like the features it adds to what I had in my Apple Watch. I particularly like the intensity of activity tracking, the calorie expenditure per day tracking and sleep monitor. I am really finding the information from this useful in terms of trying to get more fit and generally be healthier. It has been a great way to encourage me to push myself a little more in exercise - both in time and intensity. I like the point system of activities. I find it motivating more than I would have expected. The tone feature is interesting, but I don't get much from it personally as it doesn't track enough phrases. I will likely be turning that off to extend battery life. I fully anticipate extending the use of this past the 6 month trial at this point, and when I bought it I thought it might be worth it just for 6 months. If it died now or I lost it or something, I would purchase another one.",5
1033,"Okay, I understand now that sleep takes a few days to gather enough information. However, it still isn't great at tracking sleep. My pattern is ""sleep at 10pm-ish, then wake up at 11pm is for an hour or so and try to get back to sleep, then fitful sleep until wake up."" The band thinks the 10pm to midnight or 1am is me being ""awake."" Not sure if this is possible to fix, the sleep pattern is an odd one :-). Aside from this, all other functions are really good.",4
1034,"I’m on the fence with this band  , I have not activated voice and the battery lasts two days. I’m unsure if it is any better then my 25$ Sound peats. I don’t care for the charger- it seems to take along time to charge (again my cheapee 2 hrs max) several hrs for this band,  and no indicator when charged. Cannot connect to two devices should be able to put it in WiFi mode to add my second iPad to see progress. Don’t think the scan feature is accurate as advertised in compared to measure and weight. I’ll give it some more time but rethinking and may revert back to old cheapo , I got to hand it to Amazon tho,  that was quite an advertise campaign , got me thinking I needed it- definitely won’t be a subscriber to the halo 3.99 per month deal. Thanks",3
1035,"I have lost weight, improved muscle tone and realized how I sound to others! I love the app and the variety of workouts! I tend to get bored with doing the same thing . Then I stop working out. But with the app, I can change daily, do more than one class and continue progress ANYWHERE!!",5
1036,"This product is a nice attempt by Amazon to provide a comprehensive health monitor. However, the measurements it takes are woefully inaccurate. The variance between the Halo heart monitor and my Garmin chest band heart monitor seems to average a difference of approximately 25 %. The good news, I suppose, is that the Halo is consistently inaccurate, meaning that it is “off"" the correct measurement by the same amount most of the time. So overall it MAY provide useful health data. Unfortunately, with the sensor input being so far off, I have little confidence in this device. It still motivates me to do the hard work of staying fit. AND I was most impressed that Amazon called me to understand my feedback better. I’m confident that they will continue to improve the product.",2
1037,"I liked the sleep app, although it would record me as sleeping when i was laying still reading a book. It gives a lot of info.  The heart rate seemed accurate,  when i would compare it to manually taking it.  The band is low profile, i barely knew i had it on. My first one was great,  but it was too large.  I had to return it and buy the smaller one. They wouldn't do an even exchange because I bought mine during the early release.  The second one wouldn't connect to the app, the purple light continually blinked. I contacted customer service,  they didn't try to troubleshoot it. So, I decided to get a refubd and try the Oura ring,  along with my fitbit. Also, I wish Halo had HRV, (heart rate variability). In summary the halo is good.",3
1038,I may not be able to keep the halo and use it for all that it can be used for as the covering over the sensor caused red welting where it was against my skin. I currently have it in my pocket and will try to wear it at night to track my sleep. The step count is nothing near the same as the Fitbit I've had for years and neither is the activity monitoring. I've had it just a month now so I'll try to continue to use it and monitor it against other activity trackers I've used in the past to see if things change.,4
1039,I have been using this Halo for a few months no. I use it mainly for sleep track which it does a decent job at. My real issue with this thing is charger.  It's terrible. I have to fiddle with it for 5 minutes to get it to work. Who thought a flimsy clamp with a good idea for a charge. Such a terrible design. I won't be subscribing to the service. I don't see the value,3
1040,"If you are anything me, middle aged, overweight, no motivation, and think you can't do it!! Then the Amazon Halo is for you!! I've only had it a couple of weeks, but I feel as though it has changed my life. I had already started doing a little 20 min walk about 3 or 4 times a day with my dog. Thinking I was really doing something! Wrong!! But the Amazon Halo really gave me the tools to change my life for the Good!! Of course you are always excited to get a new gadget, but this one is worth every dime! It made me want to challenge myself. So instead of just a 20 min walk  3 or 4 time a day. This past Saturday and Sunday I walked 8 miles!! 4 on Saturday and 4 on Sunday. I am serious!! I will post a picture below. I'm hope I can keep it up!!",5
1041,"I like the look and feel of it, although it would be nice to at least be able to see the time. I really only use the tone part and the sleep part. The tone part is interesting, but not enough info and not likely to make me change anything. The sleep app shows me sleeping poorly, with only minutes of deep sleep. Another tracker I have does not show this, I would like to know what the Halo uses to track sleep. Overall I’m not blown away by this, but this was my first real experience with a tracker. I feel like it could use some upgrades.",4
1042,"I wear it all the time, except place on charger when showering, I'm in the app everyday checking status, it has definitely helped me improve physical activity habits. I especially love having all of the tracking without an additional screen stuck on my body. I'm a fan.",5
1043,"Sleep tracking seems horrible inaccurate. I have issues with sleep which is why I purchased it. It will say I fell asleep instantly, when I lie awake at night for quite some time before I actually fall asleep. Other nights, it seems to be right. But unsure, since it doesn’t always record my ‘awake’ times in the middle of the night. The fitness/activity tracker also seems off. I do really love the body scanner- very cool concept and mostly on point. It was super uncomfortable at first, but I have gotten used to it. The tone tracker is SO off. I work customer service, so I am very aware of my tone and it does not track properly, which is unfortunate. Extra bands are high-price and I wish a non-‘cloth’ band would come standard like many other fitness bands.",3
1044,"The first one I bought for my husband for Christmas stopped charging in February. We have two charging cables, and neither works, so it’s not the cable.  Amazon told me to order a replacement (which I did), and then the product mysteriously showed up as unavailable on the website a couple days later. I got an email asking if April delivery was ok, and I said yes (assumed they were having low stock issues). Today on March 16th, the new one arrived (now 3-4 weeks “early” based on edited expected delivery date), but it is clearly not a new item. It has a random sticky note with the number 1 on it, the inner box is not in the outer shell correctly, nothing was taped up, and the band and halo were throw in to the inner box and not how they are supposed to be around the wrist mold. I don’t know if I received someone’s returned item or a refurbished item or what! I’m very turned off and have never received an item of such poor quality from Amazon before. This is disgraceful. The device will not connect and is not able to be used at all. I would have rather waited until April and received a brand new item. I just talked to customer service and was only given the choice to return it, as they are still listed as unavailable on the website.So what I’m wondering is if there are known issues and Amazon removed the product to try to fix something before fulfilling more orders. Whenever this comes back in stock, be weary of ordering. I love all my other Amazon products (and we have a ton!), but something doesn’t seem right about this one.",1
1045,"The BMI feature, that uses your photos, is the sole reason I bought this. My wife's Fitbit is probably better for many of the other features. An Apple watch runs rings around both. HOWEVER, if you want to see what your body fat is, pretty reliably, then this is the one. Since owning this band, I have gone from 24.5% to 21.9%. It is very motivating to track your progress this way. I think other reviewers have a mistaken opinion of the muscle and body fat ratio, and are think they are harder bodied than they are, and are blaming the features of Amazon's unit. They are mistaken. This thing is accurate.Sleep tracking works, as long as you don't get up in the middle of the night. It doesn't count naps.Step counter only works for steps. Forget cycling, swimming, rowing, as it won't track it.HR monitor is accurate.There are some other useful features in the app, but I wouldn't buy this band for those.",5
1046,"I will say I am surprised at how average this tracker is.  I own and used the Whoop Strap, Samsung Active 1 and Active 2 watches.  I rate this my favorite tracker.  The steps seem the most accurate, the caloric burn is average, auto tracking is above average on tracking, sleep tracking is above average.  I found the whoop and Active watch to be very inaccurate on caloric burn.  The whoop was best sleep tracker, Halo is 2nd, Active is worst.  Step tracker Whoop and Halo are great, Active randomly counts steps while driving.Overall great purchase to monitor overall activity levels.",4
1047,"The features I find most useful are the Body Scans with body fat %, Activity Score, and Sleep Rating. I turned off tone because it does noticeably drain the battery faster and in during the pandemic this isn't as useful a feature for someone who lives alone. I like that sedentary minutes are subtracted from your Activity Score, as this is something I need to work on. I also find it useful how it breaks your activity into different categories (intense, moderate, and light). I don't find I use the labs much beside some of the sleep ones. I do like that it also analyzes their effectiveness. For instance, I actually take longer to fall asleep listening to the sound bath or nature sounds although I like both of them. The Body Scan with body fat % was probably my deciding factor in buying this and I'll be interested to see how this changes. Lastly, I appreciate how easily this syncs with my iphone. I often have had syncing issues with Fitbit and some apps with the iWatch.",5
1048,I got this product to track my steps and coordinate with WW but that's not been the motivating factor for me. This product measures your body fat percentage.  It's easy to have the app take a photo of you--from all sides!!!--and give you an instant measurement.  I WAS SHOCKED!!  Not only to see photos of myself in my underwear from all sides in broad daylight but the % #?!!!  WOW!  That's worth the price of admission!  That's what I'm gong to be focusing on...getting that down.  I can't rate the sleeping because I don't wear it during the night. I found the fabric band it came with uncomfortable but I just got the rubber band and that seems to be better.  I haven't worn it in the shower. I can recommend this product if only for the fat measurement feature.,3
1049,"I love the idea of it.  The concept of activity points that you earn based on your heart rate during exercise is a fantastic idea.  It made me work harder than just getting my steps in.  However, when I’m lifting weights or doing something that doesn’t cause my hr to go over 100, it doesn’t count it as exercise.  So unless I manually put in my routine, it wouldn’t count.  Also,  it’s been acting up lately, not holding a charge and not syncing properly.The voice recognition (tone) was cool, but drained the battery, so I turned it off after the first week.  Again, cool idea, but it wasn’t practical. I think that with a few adjustments and tweaking that this could be a great product.  For now, I’ll go back to using my Fitbit.",3
1050,"I love my fitbit. I wanted this primarily for the voice and tone feature. I wore both at the same time. Stats for the other things were comparable.  However, the ONE thing I wanted this for NEVER worked consistently. If I was having a conversation I had to go on the app and try to tell it I was talking. What is the point of that? I had very little results and I wound up honestly just getting frustrated with it. It's not even charged at this point and I havnt worn it it weeks. Wasted money because I threw out the box and couldn't send it back.",2
1051,I was excited to try this as I've had a fitbit in the past.  This is nice that it's not a screen on my wrist.  I do with the battery life was longer but I assume as time goes on and they perfect it or come out with newer models there will be more bells and whistles.  for now it's nice tracking my sleep.  I do agree with someone who previously said it might not pickup the time if you fall asleep on the couch as I often so.  but it's also incentive to get in bed instead of falling asleep in front of the TV.,4
1052,"It is just as Amazon says. The body scan was an experience. I wore it religiously for 6 months and I was hoping it would push me to move more. It did not it was very comfortable to wear  and unless you have one, it looks ok like a wrist band.  It tracked my sleep, though I knew I had awful sleep patterns. I was so excited to get it and to put that fitbit to rest but now every thing is resting. Its up to me not a device to get motivated and start caring for my health.",4
1053,"I love this for sleep tracking and activity tracking. That’s about all you’ll get but it’s worth it just for that alone. I guess the saying if you’re going to do one or maybe two things then do it well and this little guy does do it’s job. NOT LIKE an apple/Samsung watch, not even close. No time telling, no Alexa. Does come with 6 months of “service” free. Not sure how much after but still a good product. If your curious or have sleep issues then you should get this and decide the $4-5/month or whatever is worth it. I’m about 2-3 months in and for the data I’m getting I THINK i will pay for the service since I do have sleep problems. ONE THING TO KNOW AND AMAZON PLEASE TAKE NOTE, the charging/charger concept needs to be reworked and/or reengineered. It’s a little finicky and touchy to get the pins lined up, maybe I have a finicky one but it’s something Amazon needs to look at. The durability may not be there!!",5
1054,"The sleep tracking, steps, and the heart rate monitor are the most helpful tools on this device. I personally liked not having a display, and the band was comfortable (unless it got wet). However, the lack of certain features turned out to be dealbreakers for me and I return the product and got a FitBit Inspire instead, which does everything I want it to and more. The Halo app needs to include a food tracker or at least integrate with another food tracking app. Apparently the only app it works with is Weight Watchers, which I have no interest in joining. I never got around to using the tone of voice or body fat analysis, but I am perfectly fine without those (creepy) features. So, if you aren’t trying to lose weight or track food, this might work for you. I just needed more functionality.",3
1055,"Updated Review: The back fell off the unit sometime in the last 24 hours. I haven't been swimming, I haven't created impacts on this unit. I just use sunscreen and other skin lotions. So I have no idea why/how this happened. Ironic on a device that does not have a 'face' that's exposed to dangersAmazon support has agreed to issue a full refund upon return.****** Original Review Below *****I've been wearing Fitbit Charge 2 bands for over two years and I have had an Apple Watch for 7 months. I decided to try Halo so I could have sleep tracking overnight while my Apple Watch (Series 5) charges.  So far I'm happiest with:* Comfort* Charge lasting multiple days while wearing all the time (except showering)* Sleep tracking details with upgraded subscriptionHere's what I don't like:* The charger is HUGE and not as reliable in making a connection as Fitbit or Apple.* Useless without the app, and the app only provides notifications for 3 things (2 of the 3 being charge related)* Fabric band is getting dirty, and there are no cheap alternates to the bands Amazon sells* Sync needs me to double-press the band too often.* Body Fat estimate is more than 200% what my scale estimates. I doubt either are correct, but erring on the side of being complimentary would make me more likely to participate.My overall impression is they did a nice job on the sensors in the band, but the overall usability is very limited. Once my initial membership downgrades, I won't pay for the service. And that will have me going back to Fitbit, even though they have not been as durable as I'd like",1
1056,"I'm more of a stats and numbers person, so I really like all of the different stats that the Fitbit gives you.  Halo?  Not as much.  First of all - no watch face.  Drives me a little crazy that I have to go to the app to get my heart rate, time, activity minutes, etc.  that's probably the biggest drawback for me.  Plus, I'm a WW member, and the same activities on halo vs Fitbit net me a lot less ""points"" which is a bit discouraging for me.I received this as a freebie through WW, but I definitely wouldn't buy if I had to spend money on it.",3
1057,"Band constantly unpaired with phone  sleeping. Contrary to what the manual states,  the band does not track data, while it is disconnected (or mine does not anyhow. The app makes you redo the set-up for your band and the data from the time disconnected does not sync. Really frustrating and disappointing. In addition the app will not allow you to switch devices without an entire new set up. All, so frustrating!Update: Amazon attempted to contact me about this issue, but when I attempted to call back and schedule a call: crickets from then.",2
1058,"I've never been a watch wearer. And I was a little skeptical about wearing a wearable device like a Fitbit because of the distraction factor. And I was also concerned about irritation to my skin since I have very sensitive skin.But I have to say I really like wearing the Halo. It's comfortable, doesn't irritate my skin, I can shower with it, the recharge is fast and it really keeps accurate measurements of my activity. The thing I like most is the way it watches my sleep which has always been an issue for me and this is giving me more accurate information about what's actually happening at night. I just had my second knee replacement surgery and I thought that monitoring my activity each day with the Halo would help me monitor my progress. It has really been insightful and helpful in me tracking my activities and progress over time.",5
1059,Way more useful than just a step counting activity tracker.  This one gives you points based on your heart rate so if you are running at 128 bpm+ you get 2 points per minute and if you are just walking briskly at 95 bpm you get 1 point per minute.  The first review said it wasn't motivating because she didn't get many points.  I think it is very motivating to get and keep my heart rate over 128 bpm so I am getting points in the intense zone.  Don't expect to get many points if you're running but not fast enough to be in the intense zone.  My sister gets 1000 points a week because she spend like 2 hours a day doing HIIT. I target 300 or so.  I just wish it gave me a way to track my weight training.The body scan and tracking is great also.,5
1060,"Having used a fitbit and an apple watch, I bought the Halo out of curiosity. It is a decent band for the price. Has some of good features without a distracting screen.Pros:*Good sleep tracking*Body fat analysis is way better than just looking at a scale*Accurate heart rate monitor*Good battery life (if not using tone analysis)Cons:*Points tracking doesn't do much for active individuals. 150 points is easily achieved*Not enough exercises recognized or in list*Band is kind of uncomfortable, leaves marks on skin even when worn not too tightly*Tone analysis drains batteryOverall, I would use the band to track body fat. But that's the only feature I plan to use regularly. I would recommend the band if you are getting started on your fitness journey and want a low profile tracker with reasonable features.",3
1061,"The band does not track all sleep, even in one night. Last night I fell asleep at 10 pm, woke up at 12:30 am, then had to get up to do some things. The halo totally ignored that sleep time and just started up again from the time I went back to bed at 1:05 am. Totally lost those 2.5 hours. Not sure if tracks naps, but I'm not hopeful. Also, I would like for it to sync with Google Fit since that app is so widely used by folks who give me money when I walk enough, like Oscar the insurance company. It recognizes only Google Fit.",4
1062,"I love this fitness tracker. I wish it had a face on it to show my steps and the time, but I can find any information I want on the app. It charges fast, can track a lot of information about your health, can get workout classes with the app on your phone so the positives, in my opinion, outway the cons. I have tiny wrist and the Fitbit would not fit right and give me a rash, but this band does not. It attaches with a velcro snap and the band is super strechy. When I play soccer I do not have to worry about it getting torn off has this has happened with my fitbit.One more positive, I do not like being too tied to tecnoholoy and I like that I do not get text or email alerts. Some might find this as a negative, but I do like this feature.Overall, if you're looking for a fitness tracker without a face to tell time/steps, I would recommend this product.",5
1063,The halo band is a great product when the app is working. I’ve been a member for over 2 years. Something changed with the app about 3 months ago and getting your updated info takes hours. The app sends a message that it’s on their end and to try back later!!,5
1064,"I have an Apple Watch, and was a little skeptical about Halo, but after awhile I decided to bite the bullet on Prime Day for 50% off. This is a much better and more comfortable device to track sleep, determine your bmi or fat content and a great tool for exercise. Definitely purchase!",5
1065,"I've had fitbit since they first came out. But this, altho is not able to answer calls I rate this better than any fitbit, by far!But I'm sad to say syncing to app started not happening. I've been wearing a little over a month when I noticed the sync was not happening. I tried everything to get it working but.... Nothing.I really love this whole idea and it worked wonderfully. It looked great on my wrist and I believe it is very accurate.So I returned it with a heavy heart. I'm going to reorder after a while, let any kinks get fixed.",4
1066,"My review is primarily for the Activity tracking feature.The basic idea - move your body, get the heart pumping, score points.  You score more for 'high intensity' than 'low intensity'.  You lose points for being sedentary for too long.  Goal for the week is 150 points.On the screenshot included, I accumulated 50 points on 1/4/21.I basically did four things all day thanks to quarantine, here's a breakdown:11:30  - Played with dog in the park for 15 minutes, breathing heavily -----  8 points16:00 - A little quarantine lovin' with the girlfriend ---------------------------- 5 points20:30 - Walked the dog for 40 minutes, not breathing hard at all  ----------- 35 points23:00 - Lifted weights for 60 minutes, heart racing, out of breath often --- - 2 points (WHAT???)This is not an anomaly, have worn the Halo for two weeks now, and it's the same every time.  Lots of points for brisk walks, almost none for strength training.  I'm just disappointed.  Not to mention I look at my Halo a few times a day for the time.  : /The Halo itself fits well, is lightweight, and sleek.  I found the body fat measurement to be sort of accurate.Just two weeks of observations.",2
1067,"I've had this since it was an early-access type of deal and I love it. Not sure why it had such crappy reviews. I love how lightweight it is and that it doesn't have a screen. I hated my Apple watch because it was bulky and distracting. You don't even feel this Halo on. It tracks my sleep accurately and can sync to other apps. The battery life is really good and I love how it captures my tone even though it tells me I'm condescending a lot (I have 2 kids, 4 dogs, & 2 cats) haha. The band is easily washable with soap and water. The mobile app is easy to use and comes with a lot of cool features like Headspace, meditation, yoga nidra, etc. I just came on to buy my husband one and had to write a review because the negative reviews seem to be people who didn't actually read the product details before purchasing.",5
1068,"There is something defective with the battery life.  Please note, I don't have the tone turned on at all, and I haven't used the body feature or scan yet. I've done a reset 3 times since I received it in September, and I'm ready to do another reset.  The battery shouldn't be draining so quickly.  However, I do love this device, and I am excited to use more of the features Halo offers.  The Amazon support for Halo has been very prompt and helpful.  I may have gotten a bad batch, considering I've only had it 5 months.",4
1069,"This is not an in depth review but mainly about the sleep tracking feature. My boyfriend got early access to the Halo and purchased one for me.  One con I have found is that the sleep tracker is inaccurate. I could not fall asleep one night and was up past midnight in bed, scrolling on my phone. When I woke up I was curious to see my sleep quality, and was surprised it said I slept 9.5hrs (it was only 8am when I checked). The time I was awake in bed scrolling was captured as light sleep. I was skeptical about sleep tracking and my doubts have been confirmed.I laid in bed for another hour after waking up , on my phone again. What happened when I checked the halo app? My hours slept increased but I was awake the entire time.",3
1070,I liked it but returned it since I wasn't able to wear at work. Definitely had some cool features I wish I had more time to get familiar with.,5
1071,"You better watch out,You better not cry,You better not pout,I’m telling you why:Halo band is coming to town.It’s listening in,Checking your Tone,Gonna detect your body fat zone,Halo Band is coming to town.It sees you when you’re sleeping,It knows when you’re awake,It knows when you’ve been bad or good,So be good, for goodness sake!So far, so good (one week in), minus a day where a factory reset was needed to get the band to sync. Otherwise, it’s meeting my expectations and acting the part of a good angel, as its name implies.",4
1072,"I thought it was cool that this offers workout video programs, however I cannot cast it anywhere. It does not have the capability of casting to FIRE STICK, but it will cast to Chrome? No idea why Amazon would limit functionality on their own devices. I just wanted to be able to watch the videos on a bigger screen, so I tried to use my iPad instead. And nope, you can only pair ONE device to the Halo band, so can’t even use my iPad unless I want that to be my main tracker, which I don’t since I don’t always carry my iPad. There was so much potential there, but the intentional limited functionality is not it.The only thing cool about it is the body scan feature. Still though, this band is pretty ugly. The band has a dark pepto bismol color and it doesn’t even integrate with MyFitnessPal, but it does integrate with WW. This would be convenient if I was already doing WW, but I am not a fan of the point system so that would be your only option. The first one I got stopped charging, so I got a new replacement and wish I had returned it sooner. If you have an apple watch, stick with that. Not worth it.Update, the second Halo band that I got is now having syncing issues. Similar issues that I have also experienced with the first one. So if you stop using it for over a month, good luck getting it to sync. I have tried factory resetting the band and it pairs, but will not update therefore rendering it useless… Yeah get a Fitbit instead, you’ll get a better experience with a cheaper fitness tracker.",1
1073,"I really like the app for tracking steps, points and sleep.  I did not like how unreliable the heart rate tracking is.  It is constantly too low or way too high.  I don’t trust it.  It’s a shame because the members app is great.",3
1074,"I don’t like sleeping without my Halo. When I had trouble syncing it, customer service was really helpful.I’m happy with my purchase overall",4
1075,"I got the Halo band primarily to track my activity through out the week. It seems to be a bit glitchy still as there was one day when it showed I walked 17,000 steps before 6am. It will rate work outs what I did not even break sweat like jumping on a trampoline equivalent to 30min HIIT sessions that left me drenched. On the the sleep tracking tends to be more accurate. There are times it shows that I woke up when I have no memory of waking up and times it does not show me waking up but I clearly remember going to the bathroom. I do not use the voice recognition, and only body scan once a week if that. Overall I think it still needs work but it motivates me to continue working out to meet my goals.",3
1076,"The product worked great when I first got it. I love the available exercises on the app and the fact it tracks steps at points so I don’t have to solely concentrate on steps. There’s a lot I like but here’s the drawback.The app and the device are no longer connecting. It started happening on 2/3. It took me 2 hours to get it reset and I had to reset it by putting it on the charger, pressing and holding the button down until the white flashes then check the app to make sure the band was connected.It disconnected again today! That’s annoying because I lost three days worth of data.It’s not big and bulky like others say. It’s just like the first Fitbit model.I went back to app for the simple fact the device won’t stay connected and it doesn’t seem Amazon plans to add Apple integration. That’s a problem for me. I was one of the lucky few that was able to get an invitation to order before it was officially available to the public. Now, it’s nothing more than another device that doesn’t work like it should.I’ll update this review if and when Amazon figures out a fix to keep it connected.",2
1077,I love using the halo band to track my activity and sleep. You can edit the activity goals to suit your needs/lifestyle and it really motivates me to get some extra movement in throughout the week. The sleep tracker is helpful to identify evening routines or activities that hurt/ help sleep quality.,5
1078,"This is my first smart watch so I’d own have anything to compare it to. I thought set up was super easy, charging is very simple, body scan set up was also simple. I have to say I wasn’t impressed with my avatar, but then realized that was me!! So I’m thankful for seeing myself in a new way to help me get back on track with my fitness goals. I groom dogs for a living so I wanted something I could trust to get wet and not get ruined. So far, so great! I’m excited to switch bands and get my husband one. I think his body scan avatar will be less than impressive also!! I love the sleep tracking and voice tracking. I am one who sometimes speaks louder than I should, not because I’m angry just because I’m loud. So this has already helped me lower my tone. The sleep tracking is great! I now can see how much quality sleep I’m getting. Over all no complaints about the Halo.",5
1079,"I have had the Halo band for a while and I must confess I love the accuracy of the sleep tracker. The mobile app is amazing. It has content workouts, recipes, headspace for good sleep. I honestly love to sleep with the bedtime stories 🥰😂. The customer service is prompt to help you with technical support.",5
1080,"Interesting fitness tracker. Works good most of the time. Some mornings i wake up with 500 or 1000 steps though.  Also doesn't gets my heart rate right when i use a stair master: it's always 1/2 of what its supposed to be. Otherwise it does a pretty good job tracking stats.I was between a medium and a large, so i went up to large as the guide said and it fits pretty good. I do have to tighten the band as far as it will go and it makes me worried that it won't fit if the band stretches out over time.",4
1081,"despite years after the fitness wearable revolution, I think the idea of a simple wellness band is still underserved market.  I own several fitness wearables, Garmin, Fitbit, Apple Watch.  I was hoping this would serve as a long battery life, discreet, wear and forget type of band which would give me rich analytics given Amazon's deep root in AI work.  Specifically I was hoping Amazong would do a better job than Apple, give me an HRV analysis, a simple dashboard to help me monitor my general wellness and make sense of all the telemetry that it was collecting.  in summary, the band fell short of my expectations for battery life and while I have no doubt the app design / service will continue to improve, my trusty series 3 Apple Watch actually gives me everything I need for now.",3
1082,"This is a super comfortable fitness tracker, and I love all it does.  I had a Fitbit HR 2 and it just felt huge on my wrist.  I enjoy the software on this product, however, I do not feel that the sleep monitoring is correct. (not a big deal to me).  I honestly don't know how long I will wear it though- I really miss seeing the time more than I thought I would.  I read the information and knew before I ordered that it does not show the time- did not think it would bother me as much as it did.",4
1083,"Typical, middle-of-the-road device adding some features without asking is something they want to try will be supported by any software, other than theirs, of course! Anyway, registers sleep stages better than Garmin, Doesn't necessarily detect sleep as well as Garmin. We are talking 4 v 9.8 hours, but sleep stages are far better registered- I dream most nights, yet only the Halo can that. The Garmin says I only ever wake up, never dream.I know which one more accurately represents my own life in a certain aspect. Find what's best for you, and what you can afford. If you can afford multiple devices, it helps to use different varieties (especially as different algorithms are involved across generations and brands of device",3
1084,"Could not make it through a day with the battery. I bought for 2 features that really dissapointed. The BMI measuring photo ability and the voice analysis to see how I come across to coworkers, public interactions, etc. Most of the time the voice analysis did not even pick up on my dialogue so no real good data there. The BMI measuring is no different than just photos of what you look like (could do with photo timer on your own) and does not take into the account if you are a weight trainer. Weight will be heavier and will still need to use calipers for measurement as this tool does nothing. I was hoping would be based off of photo and data to get true BMI but is not. Maybe future product will be better. No way I could use for sleep analysis and my work day. Battery would never last the night and day. Barely makes an 8 hr work  day now with reduced settings. And to top it off, no display on the unit so is just a strange looking band on your arm. Not for me. Was excited but let down.",2
1085,I've tried a couple of other fitness trackers and in my opinion the Halo is the best. It tracks everything I need it to plus more. It's a little difficult to sync at times but that happens with most devices. There is a good selection of additional bands online so you can coordinate with what you're wearing.,5
1086,I have had my Halo a little over a year now. The feature I like most is that it does not look like a tracker. The app is easy to use with or without the paid subscription. I would get another one once this one stops functioning.,5
1087,"I do not believe that the Halo is tracking my sleep correctly.  If there is less than 2 hrs of sleep this time is not added to the total for the night and if you sleep before midnight and wake up shortly after midnight the tracker will start your sleep time at 12:01 am and not from the very first time you fell asleep.  The steps do not give any distance only time and points. I went golfing and got a total of over 15,000 steps for the day and it only shows my walk in the morning as far as points for the day.  The voice ID will drain the battery.  So I am not pleased with this I was expecting Amazon to have a great product.  I plan to get a better product some time this summer.",3
1088,Great for tracking steps and sleep patterns,5
1089,"I have been using fitness trackers for years now and this Halo band is my favorite. For starters it is a really good price for all of the features it comes with. The sleep tracking feature has been great. All of the details the app provides on my sleep has helped me make adjustments to have a better quality sleep. Next, the activity tracker is another key feature I use daily. Working from home has made me very sedentary, but paying attention to the activity tracker has pushed me to stay active. You get +1 points for light activity, +2 for moderate, +3 for intense, and -1 for sedentary time over 8 hours. These points are added up for the week. This simple formula makes it very simple to see how active you are during the week. Finally, the app has many ""Labs"" that give you ways to improve your lifestyle. I have been using the sleep quality labs very often to improve my sleep. Great band. I would highly recommend.",5
1090,"I specifically bought the Halo for its body fat measuring feature.  However, the Halo itself has nothing to do with measuring body fat; you use your phone to take pictures of yourself from different angles, and then the *app,* NOT the device, uses an algorithm to compare your pictures to thousands of pictures to give you a body fat percentage.  I thought the Halo was offering a new technology via the band to calculate body fat.  The band does not do that.There seem to be two groups, those who expected an activity watch (think Garmin or Apple watch, for example), and those who didn't.  If you expect it to be like activity watches, you will likely be disappointed.  If you expect a ""wellness"" watch, you may be satisfied with the Halo.I did return my Halo.",3
1091,"I have a lot of little aggravations with this fitness band - the step measuring is wildly inaccurate, the device itself sits funny on your wrist, VELCRO etc. But I like the body measurement feature and I like how it doesn't have a big screen on the front of it. However, my biggest problem is that it doesn't sync with any sort of calorie counting app like MyFitnessPal or LoseIt etc. Which seems like a huge oversight to me, as I was hoping for a tracker that would connect to everything so that I would only need to reference one app for everything. However, the only food tracking app it syncs with is Weight Watchers, which I have no interest in joining. That fact alone makes the tracker almost useless to me. Oh well, lesson learned and i'll be picking up a different device to try.",3
1092,"Its and OK product if you want a super-charged pedometer.Pros:- Great app with tons of functionality (but exclusively within that app and ecosystem)- Comfortable and nice lookingCons- My biggest con is the lack of integration with other apps like Strava, MyFitnessPal, Apple Health and so, thats the dealbreaker for me. The amazing set of apps it offers (within the Halo app) are great but offer no integration externally.- Tone(voice tracking) makes you wonder about privacy. Talk very excited about buying ""blue unicorn poop"" while wearing it and then see all Amazon ads for it... creepy and weirdGarmin Vivosmart 4 and Fitbit Inspire 2 are pretty much the same thing. Their lack of internal offers (like headspace or sweat or others) is compensated by the integration with other services.",3
1093,"I was apart of the invitation for the Halo. It is everything I wanted in a new health tracker. I have not use the voice tone part of the system, but I absolutely love the sleep tracker. It is giving me a great picture of my sleep pattern. This is a minimal tracker but the app is where it is at. Also this is the first time that I have had a battery last one week. The only thing I do not like is the charger that came with the device. It is a bit tricky. I am going to see if there is another charger I can get for it. I love the band that came with it but I think I am going to get a couple of more to change up the style of it. Thank you again Amazon for allowing me to have this item first. I love it.",5
1094,"Ok you still need a scale for the body scan to be accurate... but it's sooo worth it... you can see the changes the scale doesn't accurately represent and its helped me stay motivated even when the scale doesn't move.  I have had many fitness trackers over the years, but this one is the most intuitive one yet.  So much so that I even got my husband to wear one and now it's a competition who can get the most points doing chores.  Like all fitness trackers take the info with a grain of salt, but this provides valuable insight to overall health, including stress levels through the voice recognition and better sleep habits... I was not getting as much sleep as I thought I was.  All it needs is a voice operated nutrition tracker and it would finally be down to one app and device.",5
1095,"I really loved this fitness band. I like that it doesn't have a distracting, ugly screen. I like that it is lightweight. I like that it charges so quickly. This band really did improve my fitness training and sleep patterns.That being said, six months after using the band the device completely stopped working. After contacting customer service multiple times, I finally got through to someone who actually helped me. BUT there was no repair or replacement option. I got a refund, but because I got it at a special promo price, the refund doesn't cover the cost of a new band. This is terribly frustrating. Even though I truly did love the band, I don't want to spend more money for a second band to just stop working after another six months. I am undecided on what I will do.",3
1096,"I wore this for a month or so, and I just wasn't impressed overall.Cons- The battery life is about 2 days- it gets fairly dirty, quickly- very noticeable on the wrist (both in terms of looks and feeling)- very uncomfortable, especially while laying in bed/ sleeping- charger was pretty low-quality material-wise- mobile app is confusing to use- sleep tracking wasn't as solid as I expected (sometimes would cut out for periods of the night)Pros- charges extremely fast- good price point- even though the sleeping tracking wasn't as great as I was expecting, it was nice that I could wear it at night and see my sleep score",2
1097,"I really like this product for exercise and sleep assessment.  I also use the meditations a lot, but then I received the Calm app and I use that more instead.  The Halo is cool because it scans the tone of your voice.  I thought my tone was more positive, but I guess the year of covid always has bad news. The one major problem I have is that the band gets so dirty.  I have the pink band which I love.  But have to suds it up pretty often. It might be better if it had a protective coating on the band.",4
1098,"The Halo gives you a lot of information about your lifestyle.  I have only had it a couple of weeks and have yet to tap into all it has to offer.It can be hard re-pairing it if it loses connection with your phone, but not a huge issue at all.",5
1099,"I guess I ordered too big, I didn't understand the measurements, I believe I got a large for some reason, should of got a small probably. Anyways it does it job, not sure why anyone would pay for the membership really, just pointless stuff, I turned the voice off because it ate battery and didn't tell me accurate voice info. The charging system is annoying, I have to move it around to get in the right spot...buy again? Nah, maybe something more basic or hight tech? Not sure but this is alright, probably not worth the cost.",4
1100,"My primary testing was focused on how well it worked as a fitness band for running and other exercises. In this area it is able to capture heart rate, duration, distance, calories burned and more. The reason it doesn't work for me is I would prefer audio feedback during the exercise, but to be fair I did not look into this prior. It is light weight though I am not a fan on the standard strap that it comes with as the velcro constantly gets snagged when trying to put it on or remove it. Build quality looks and feels solid.I have no use for sleep tracking and the value for a financial membership is not appealing. The tone of voice sounds cool in concept but not something I care to have tracked or having this turn into a listening device.",3
1101,I love the device itself. It’s hardly noticeable. I don’t know why they would put a fabric wrist band on the tracker. It collects sweat and becomes itchy quickly. It’s a hassle to remove and clean it every time. I enjoy the sleep tracking since it’s automatic and seems pretty accurate. I also like the fact I don’t have to manually turn on work out mode since it does a good job of tracking active movement. The app you use to control it is a bit clunky. I can never find the labs I sign up for until it prompts me the next day.,4
1102,"Amazon Halo is like a beta version of the first Fitbit to ever been released in the market. It is highly inaccurate and measuring steps. Shifting gear usually adds around 50 steps. 30 minutes after i woke and it say i already walked 1400 steps. which is insane. it's most special additions like voice tone and body fat are uninteresting and not worth the price tag. Heart-rate monitor does not show resting heart-rate while sleeping. It's probably amazon's worst product.Update:The only way to actually use this device is to only strap it on when you exercise. When it comes to sleep. It appears it only track it at night. it does not track my naps at all. and some days it does not track sleep. and there is no way to manually add a sleep cycle.On the 20th of May I was contacted by Amazon customer service regarding my ""negative"" review. I was told i should replay to the email (as per their instructions) so they would contact me in 24 hrs. I explained my situation in an email and responded with another number.This is the email i received was this:Hello,You've written to an address that is not currently accepting incoming e-mails. You can visit our help pages to findanswers to common questions or use the contact us link at the bottom of any help page to talk to a customer serviceassociate.Apparently when. Amazon says to you (Once your information has been updated, please feel free to respond to this email and we will be in touch within 24 hours.) they don't actually mean it.",1
1103,"The band is comfortable, and compared to my Garmin 645 Forerunner, it's just as accurate in measuring heart rate. And that's about it.  It's not gonna knock your socks off in any other category. So if you buy this and use the subscription....just like ALL OTHER FITNESS TRACKERS....it's 100%  up to you to put in the work to get the rest, lose the weight, change your diet, etc...and input all that data into the app.",2
1104,"I’ve had my halo since September. I love it, it’s simple but informative it gives me all that I’m looking for I think the tone portion is very cool and interesting. But the biggest issue that I find with it, even on the less tone mode it still died REALLY fast it doesn’t even last 2 days most times but if you don’t mind charging a product randomly during the day since you want your sleep tracked (if that’s why you bought it for) you wouldn’t be able to charge it overnightOverall I’m pleased with it but the battery could use improvements!",4
1105,"The size and form of the device are fantastic, you barely feel it on you. The step tracking feature is as good on any other, and frankly daily +/- 50 step accuracy is not something I care about. The best features for me are the Body Fat Analysis and the Labs, the body fat analysis really surprised me, showing that I have more fat than I thought, but that gives me even more motivation to get on the treadmill :) and the Labs tab is full of free programs from apps that usually cost $50 annually like Headspace, Relax Melodies and many more.Many of the negative reviews here sadly seem to be because of human laziness  to read the product description, one should not buy a microwave and expect it to refrigerate an ice cream :)P.S. HR live tracking is very useful when working out on your cardio equipment, no more need for another heart rate monitor.I love my Halo.",5
1106,"First off, it looks nice. Was easy to charge and set up. I always wanted to look at it for the time though bhahahahahaha, silly me. I was super motivated to use it to it's full potential to help change my life. Now, I returned it only because it wouldn't charge. I don't think I had it for a full week. The steps I believe were inaccurate because I wasn't moving and it was calculating steps. I thought maybe it was getting my steps from my phone from earlier, I don't know. I love the sleep feature. I actually learned about sleep patterns using it. Heart rate feature the same. I literally watched and tried to get my heart rate lower, I did. The voice feature needs an upgrade. I don't understand why it won't tell you the words that you used that gave you that rating. It's super vague. That is your rating and that's it. I didn't have time to look into the feature more or any other features at that. I was looking forward to the body fat, workouts, and meal plan features. I didn't want a device that dies in less than a week. I really wanted this to work out. I was willing to look past a few things that needed improving with time.",1
1107,Been wearing my Halo for over a year and I love it. Tracks my sleep accurately and encourages me to get to bed on time. I find myself pushing harder to keep my activity level up each day which is helping me get fit. The Halo has had many updates and it gets better everytime!,4
1108,"I really love the design. The look and feel is great but it has one flaw, the velcro strap. I don't really exercise much but the strap seems to not want to stay connected. I ended up sewing a new strap and it works nicely. I'd hate to get it for the price it is just for the strap to fail. The app is great but for some reason when setting it up it wouldn't let continue setting it up after selecting gender. Hopefully that's resolved now since I haven't had to set it up again. Charging it on the band is a hassle but thankfully it's easy to take apart and put back together. One thing I love about it is that I was able to hook my watch to the band so I can have the band and my smart watch.",3
1109,The app is great for tracking sleep and activities but fall extremely short on Nuitrition.  The calories are based on the meal plans available in app. You can't search for a specific food or add a personalized meal/recipe. I go back to My Fitness.I am on a trial for 6 months. If Nuitrition hasn't i.proved I can't see wanting to pay for a monthly membership.,5
1110,"The activity tracker (points for heart rate), which is a basic function for any armband is paywalled at $4 per month.  They give you 6 months of courtesy membership, but afterwards, the core functions of the device that you have come to know and love become bricked.  I purchased this device because it was the most economical fitness tracker for having long-term.  It had unique functions that other devices did not, however, at $48 a year, holding on to this device makes it among the most expensive fitness tracker on the market if you have it for any significant amount of time.When  I purchased the Halo band, it was my impression that the fitness content and the nutritional videos  were priced at $4 a month, however, this line has moved over the last year as Amazon has realized that even that content is not worth the value.  Instead, they priced locked the activity tracker, which one has come to find as a CORE feature of the device and the TONE function, which was a major selling point.  I have purchased this device for several family members and am now considering steering more people away as this has made the device one of the most expensive on the market because they price-locked algorithms that are innate within the device's software.  It is bricked.  I attached a picture of my home screen when I log into the device.  First image I see is a lock. Quite welcoming for a device I own.",1
1111,"Sleep tracking is definitely not accurate, it is usually off by 20-30minutes or up to 1hr. I suspect this is due to how long it takes it to realize you are asleep (that's why it doesn't register naps). Go to sleep at 9:30pm, wake up at 6:00am and says sleep 7hours and 15min.I have noticed this pattern over several days, and I fall asleep extremely fast.It also doesn't track naps, which is annoying, since a nice nap at 4pm will affect sleeping stages later, therefore it throws all the stats off.If it can't recognize a 45min to 1hour nap, it makes sense why the night sleep is off, it means it takes the app that long to realize you are sleeping.",3
1112,"Update, so the application setup was a nightmare but maybe that was my doing(see below) but now that I have it set up and am using it I really actually enjoy this band its comfortable and so detailed in everything it presents to you.  I wish the exercising portion was a little more seamless (I went on a 15 min walk and it wanted me to keep the screen on to play relaxing music the whole time) but I think as time moves on this will get evened out some.I got an amazon halo and was very excited to use it but I cant because the app wont send my phone a message to verify my account and also then locked me out of my account telling me to wait an hour to reset it and its been 3 hours and is still locked out.",5
1113,"I honestly don't understand some of the complaints here.  It's not at all difficult to charge.  You just clip this plastic thing to it, and it charges automatically.  It's not difficult to put on or take off.  It's velcro.  How does something get easier than velcro?  As for the device itself, I mainly use it to track my sleep, as I have not been sleeping well. It also tracks your heart rate and voice tone, which I think is a pretty interesting, if not useful feature, for me.  I've not uses it to track my steps, because my phone does that for me. I've tried a few of their labs, some of which are more useful than others, but that's really more of a personal thing.  It's lightweight, as comfortable to wear as a medium size watch, and holds a charge fairly well.  It retails for $100, so comparing it to a $300 device is unfair.",5
1114,"I wanted a fitness tracker without a screen and without distractions.  This one meets those two needs.  It also includes a great interface that provides more than just counts of steps and hours of sleep; activity and sleep scores that help contextualize the data.  I haven't used all of the features yet, but am very pleased so far.",5
1115,"I recieved my Halo as a gift and the only reason its 4 stars from me is the sleep tracking does not work for me. However I love most of what this band offers. I like the app it's easy to navigate and use. The activity tracking seems accurate. The only issue I have with this band is the sleep tracking, it does not work for me since I am a mover in my sleep.",4
1116,"The band reports 3200 calories daily average consumption which is in the ball park (within 150-200 of actual) of empirical data with weight, age, height, body fat, exercise frequency combined. HOWEVER, which dropped two stars from my verdict is the heart rate measurement. For about 20% of the time it can be very inaccurate: I feel my heart pounding at about 110/min but the live monitor only shows 70+. If you touch on the wrist pulse and time for 1 minute, it will be very off too under those wired 20% of time. This is extremely noticeable when you are wearing a wrist wrap on the other hand or the same hand. I am a hard core weight lifter and calculates calories intake during bulking and cutting so daily accuracy is very important. But it fails you about 1 out of 5 days...",3
1117,"I love this wearable device EXCEPT for the body scan. The halo says I’m 15% body fat, my smart scale says I’m 10% and the handheld scanner at my gym says I’m just over 8%. I weight about 140 lbs, 5 foot 8, and in great shape. I think the halo’s body scanner is very inaccurate.I really like the calorie and step counter. I feel they are a lot more accurate than my Apple Watch. I wear both everyday. I think the sleep tracker is accurate but don’t have anything to base it off of.Solid product but definitely room for improvements.",4
1118,Having had a Garmin fitness tracker for many years I took the plunge to try something new and so far have been very impressed. The move away from steps to time and intensity of activity has been a plus for me as I use a Peloton bike as my main exercise activity. Sleep tracking matches more how I feel my sleep was than the reading I got from Garmin. Body scanner is an eye opener and has been a big driver for me to lose some weight. You can not hide from the image you get. The apps could do with a little more work one example is when I cycle on the Peloton it knows I have done exercise but I have to delete that and re-enter it putting that I was cycling would be good if there was an option to edit it correctly and change to what you had been doing. Over all well impressed with first month of use,5
1119,"I have had it for just a few months and it is giving me fits when charging. It will show the red light that it is connected to the charger, but a while later there won’t be anything and stops charging. I’ll reconnect it and the light will come back on, but it can take almost a full day to get it to charge all the way. It’s getting worse as time goes on.",3
1120,"I’m loving my amazon halo. It has a lot of useful information. Recipes, sleep tracking, counting steps. I’m really finding so many wonderful recipes. And lots of exercises. More than I expected it to be",5
1121,"I really wanted to like the Halo fitness tracker but it just has too many problems. I love that the band is small and doesn't have a screen as I love wearing a watch and I don't need two separate devices telling me the time. I just wanted a small, unnoticeable fitness tracker to wear and this is what attracted me to the Halo fitness band. The problem is, this fitness tracker is bad. The tracker regularly misses my workouts so I can't tell what my HR during the workout was and I don't get to see the points added to my daily log unless I manually add them. The sleeping tracker missed half my nights of sleep which is annoying as that was one of the features I had been really looking forward to. Charging this fitness band is a nightmare to do as there is often no notification light that the band is charging resulting in times where I think my band is charging for several hours and then I notice the battery is still low. The app is nice when it works, it is just that it crashes on my pixel 5 often. All in all, I wish I went with a more reliable fitness tracker...",2
1122,"Was part of the beta program for this product and was highly impressed on its accuracy and features. Make no mistake this is a fitness tracker and NOT a smart watch. The focus is holistic and balances sleep, nutrition, exercise, mood, and body composition to give you a total health picture.  In this scope of fitness, this band does more than you’d expect. Biggest downside is having no visual indicator for at least basic feedback of time or critical alerts/notices. A display screen even if just LED would be useful. Battery life is solid despite a bit of an awkward charger.",4
1123,"So the only thing I don’t like is when you use the tone, the battery dies within the day. Other than that, there is no clock or screen on the band. It fits right on my wrist, it’s not uncomfortable. Without the tone analysis on, the battery lasts about a week. The app is easy to use and even has helpful hints and tricks to help you exercise, sleep, speak, and look better. This band is actually focused on making the wearer a better person, for that I couldn’t be more grateful.",4
1124,"I purchased a Amazon Halo because at 68 years old, I want to watch my health closer. I received the device today (9/13/21). while attempting to put the device on my wrist it was obviously too small. I contact the Amazon customer service hoping I could just swap my medium band for a large. All they semed to want to do was give me my money back. I asked if they wouldsend me a large band, at my expence but they just wanted to refund my money in the form of a gift card. I hung up. They seem to assume that everyone wants something for nothing.",3
1125,"It’s nice to be able to wear fashionable watches then just a tracker/apple/Samsung. Which is one of the reasons why I got this. Down side is it doesn’t log food intake, and sleeping HR. Being an athlete those are both important. It’s a start. Price is reasonable. For all you get. It’s a good starter band for most first timers getting a change in one’s life style.",3
1126,"The band itself is a good product. I've been able to track my activity and health over the past 6 months and I have made some real positive changes in my life because of this feedback.The body scan feature, however, has frustrated me to no end. it used to work great, but for whatever reason, the app can no longer recognize my body against a clean, white wall even with all the room lights on. The app continues to tell me to move backward, and glitches between telling me to widen and narrow my stance. Incredibly frustrating that this part is not working because it worked flawlessly before and is one of the only reasons I considered paying the monthly subscription.",5
1127,"I have just started using my Halo band and I am blown away with the capabilities. I am still learning, but the sleep tracking is amazing. I will add more as I become more familiar. There is so much to learn in using it to the best application for me. Wow!!",5
1128,"I was loving most of the features of this tracker, then after a little over 6 months, it fell apart.  Didn't buy the additional warranty, so I have no recourse, which sucks.  Most likely will not repurchase.",4
1129,"I loved the look and design of the Halo.  I really wanted to like this tracker since I don't want or need a screen on my fitness tracker.  The band was comfortable and easy to use.  Tracking was adequate though it did report some video game time as light sleep on me.  The App was simple and highlighted the important tracking stats well.  I only tried the BMI measurement once but ultimately wasn't an important feature to me.  The real fatal flaw and reason I returned it after less than two weeks was battery life.  Even with the microphone turned off, I could not go a full day on a single charge.  For a device with no screen, this is absurd.  I was always stressed over the charge level and when I was going to be able to get it back on the charger.  Returned and got a Fitbit Charge 3.  While I don't like the look and feel of the Charge 3 as much as the Halo, the battery lasts at least a week at a time.  I really wanted to like the Halo but can only recommend it if Amazon can address the battery issues and clean up some bugs.",2
1130,"Pros: Sleep tracking is amazing, faceless tracker, syncs with WW (Weight Watchers), interesting “lab”articles & videos, long charge (I don’t have voice tone turned on)Cons: I was hoping the actual tracking mechanism was more slim (it’s about 1/2” tall off my wrist) - would be great if it was hardly visible; while it syncs with WW, it only applies to steps and manually designated activity from the Halo app, I still have to manually track my sleep on WW for now; I hope to see a lot more band designs/options in the future - the offering is really limited.",4
1131,"This discreet and comfortable tracker keeps you informed about your sleep quality and daytime activity. I do not usually wear a watch, so I didn’t expect to be comfortable with the band and tracker, especially while sleeping, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The battery lasts about a day, and the app lets you know when to charge up. I sort of wish it had a clock display but it’s quite unobtrusive and easy to wear. The charging clip is not good.  I hope they redesign it because it’s somewhat awkward and the clip is so strong that it’s difficult to handle.",4
1132,"Things I like:1)It's comfortable. No really, I've tried a couple other healthbands, and am constantly tightening or loosening them. This stretches and adjusts on its own.2)It works. I want to know what my heart rate is or how bad my sleep is? Ding! Right there.3)the charger! It's not small, but that also means it clips ""better."" If you've tried some others, you know charging can be interesting. This? Giant clam eats band. 👍👍 Works for me. Very well in fact.What I don't like:I have to get out my phone to see what time it is.That's it. I'd like it if it did... If it was a watch too. I'm glad it's not a Dick Tracy. It doesn't call attention, it just does its job. 🙂For the pictures, that's a medium band and my wrist is 7"", the end of the strap doesn't pull through, so getting my hand in is a little tricky, but the stretch helps. 👍",5
1133,"The more holistic and comprehensive approach to health and wellness is a much needed advancement as wearables become more ubiquitous in our lives!I rated the product 5 stars because I think it delivers on a lot given the price. Here is some feedback I have to improve the product:I would like to see a better charger design, the charger is not very intuitive and requires me to press down to make contact. Also the latency from charger to LED is a bit long especially if the device is completely dead.The button combinations are not very intuitive and I do not remember them and I believe the button to be unnecessary. I think it should only be used for mute and unnmute.I would like to see more third party app integration especially to Strava! I find myself wearing this band and my android watch to track runs, hikes, or bike rides. Halo should be able to track workouts as well.",5
1134,I have been wear the halo now for awhile as well as the Fitbit sense. They vary in sleep time so not really sure which is more accurate but I like them both. They each have nice features. Just wish there were more bands available for the halo,5
1135,"*edited April 2021After my review, I was contacted by Amazon support, and they offered to replace the device. After replacing it it worked quite well, with very few events where it disconnected and wasn't tracking sleep and activities.It keeps on disconnecting and there is no way to know that your activity is not tracked. The double click doesn't work most of the time. There is no way to know when the battery is about to die. The sleep scoring doesn't take in considering that you have unavoidable reasons to wake up (like a baby).",4
1136,"The only problem I had with the halo is that I have arthritis is my wrists and having to have the band tight on my wrist caused it to flare up and hurt. My husband is now using it and he loves it. It charges quickly the sleep tracking is accurate. The body scans alone are worth this. When I used to go to golds gym they charged 80 dollars per body scan. And they were not as good as what you get through this. The labs are also wonderful, the auto tracking to meet the labs is very useful.I will say I wish I could curate the information in the app to find specific answers to questions I have. I know the data is there but we don't have access to it.All in all great and if in the future there is a monitor that is less hard on my wrist bone I will gladly buy it.Thank you",5
1137,"Using Halo since September. Likes: no screen, the point systems for exercise and sleep are very motivating, seeing intensity levels for exercise and having that show in my points for the day along with steps and calorie burn, the body fat system is my favorite feature….it’s incredibly motivating to look at the before and after photos and be able to monitor that percentage.My only dislike is the drain on the battery using the tone feature but you’re able to turn it off.",4
1138,I really like this band! The only thing that is a hit and miss the tone.. sometimes it doesn’t read but once a day which is crappy…. But it is really awesome to see my workouts in depth along with my heart rate. I do intend to buy a friend one too!!,4
1139,"Most bands are irritating, bulky, or distracting to me, but the Halo is very comfortable. I have no problem wearing this band all day. It's smaller and unobtrusive than I thought it would be. The charging clamp works perfectly, just remember to give it an extra squeeze to engage the charger and a red light should appear. The app is very well done. It is easy to navigate, interesting to browse, non-pushy, and works well so far. Remember to swipe down to sync and refresh, it will take several seconds for the new data to appear. The program seems to suit folks who want to just casually monitor their lifestyle or those who are really serious and want to dig in deeper with lots of details and built-in programs for exercise, meditation, and wellness.",5
1140,"I Have an Apple watch and a Whoop band, but I decided to try the Amazon halo band just for the hell of it.I will say it has been a month, and I am impressed.I activated all the features and tried them all.So far, they have been right on the money, and it is a lot cheaper than the Whoop band.I will recommend the halo band to anyone trying to track activities, Sleep, Movement, body, or Tone.It is fun seeing that I am coming across as sarcastic and disgusted when at work.And my movement was fair, and the Halo Band gave me a routine to improve it.Apple and Whoop both informed me I was an active person, But Halo band adds a little fun to it with the recommendations and programs all in one place.",5
1141,"I bought it for the sentiment detection, but that feature really isn't that useful. It randomly picks up the sentiment that I find often surprising, and then I have no idea what I said afterward. In other words, I don't find the feedback actionable. On top of that, voice analysis crushes the battery. I get a week without it, just over a day when it's turn on.HOWEVER... the sleep tracking, body scanning, and exercise detection are top-notch. Also, I find it comfortable to wear and it's fairly small and unobtrusive. I think it's a great value for the money.",4
1142,"I purchased during the initial roll out of the product, and as an avid athlete, was primarily interested in more data to base decisions on.Overall, as a fitness tracker I am underwhelmed.Features I like:Battery life is goodSleep tracking does give some valid information that my other devices can't, such as a baseline temperature and variations from it once established. The remaining sleep data seems accurate as well.The band is sturdy and comfortable for the wearer, but is rather abrasive and scratchy/clunky for your partner in the middle of the night.The step tracking is fairly accurate.Features I don't like:The recurring revenue model is simply not worth it to me and I have canceled it proactively at the end of the six month trial. I'm not sure if I won't have a hundred dollar paperweight at that point, but it simply isn't worth 4$/moThe body fat analysis app is cool, but I suspect it has very little to do with the sensors on the watch and more on mathematically calculated data that you give the app.I have not turned on the tone analysis, so I have no opportunity to observe.Overall result. I wouldn't buy again...hard pass for me",2
1143,I've had my Halo for nearly 1 year. I mainly bought it to help track my sleep. The sleep tracker is hit and miss when it does track.,3
1144,It was good for your basic tracking. If your looking for a more detail and accurate maybe not the right. If you are looking to start a weight loss or getting into a routine it would be a good starter tracker. The charger was cheap and ended up braking on me and coupling charge the watch anymore.,3
1145,"I've had this product for ten days. It's been touch and go all the way. Whilst it monitors my sleep and heart rate rather accurately, the work outs and step counting has been spotty at best. I've been walking two miles  a day on a treadmill. Sometimes it records the activity, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it synchs with the app, sometimes I have to restart my phone several times to see the data on the app. Compared to other trackers, it's pretty much okay. I just expected a bit more for the price. Hopefully, Amazon will continue to update and improve this in the future.",3
1146,"The Halo has been working well for me, right  out of the box.  Setup was quick and easy. I've been enjoying review each day of it's data, with regards to my sleep, exercise, and tone.  The Halo has a unique feature, in the ""Body Scan"".  Once you get used to positioning your phones camera.  Also you need to have a fairly large area, that allows your phone's camera to see your body from head to toe.  I like this feature and plan to use it more in the future, as I have only used it twice, since owning the device.Overall, I'm happy with the Halo, for what it offers in a health tracking device and hope that Amazon continues to develop it in the future.",3
1147,"The main thing I wanted was the voice tracker and the activity tracker, and the voice tracker does not seem to work no matter what I try.  I have done all of the tips and tricks it suggests, and it still does not record any voice data during the day.  I like the activity tracker and the points and stuff, and I love the fact that you can get exercise modules and suggestions, but half of what I wanted doesn't work.",3
1148,"Pros:- lightweight- decent colors- tone & sleep monitoringCons:- Battery life :  needs daily charging- a challenge if you wear it to monitor sleep and during the day. It doesn't help that the charging clip is slippery an needs to be _just_ right to charge.- No display means the live hear beat monitor is no use without holding a phone in your hand.- The wrist bands: the length is ok but it's tough tot put on; ot buy a size bigger but then you it wrapping around your wrist too much- Subscription: I'll cancel as soon as the free months are over.Overall, with the subscription and no display, it is not good value for money. I have started the return process.",3
1149,I would love the same exact replacement band but cannot find it anywhere. Mine is two years old and the band is fraying. Any ideas?n,5
1150,"I have had it about 90 days, but have only been wearing it for the past 60 days.  It's a good start for fitness, but I almost wish that it had a watch.  I had actually lost it for a few days and wished that I had a tracker to track it.  Maybe that can be added to the app since it does tell you when the battery is low and when it is good to go again.  I really haven't used all of the features, but that will change shortly.",4
1151,"Better than any Fitbit I ever owned. I really enjoy the workouts provided in the app along with recipes and suggestions for improvement. Very motivating.  I'm not really sure about the Sleep Tracker but it gives me a general idea how much sleep I'm getting and how often I get disturbed during the night.  The app is super easy to navigate.  I turned off the voice tone after the first couple of weeks. It wears the battery down quite a bit and I found I'm mostly happy :) The thing I love the most...it's Waterproof!!! I have worn it in the shower, in the hot tub and don't worry about it getting sweaty when I work out.",5
1152,"As someone who has used a FitBit before, I much prefer this one. Is it as sleek? No, but it’s not like it’s bulky either. I like that it logs activity based on how intense that activity is instead of just by steps. Mine typically lasts 3-4 days without charging it, I have no issues with the charger either. No it doesn’t have a screen but I went into this purchase knowing that, so I’m not gonna detract points because it doesn’t have one. The sleep tracker is nice and helps me keep track of how many nightmares I have a night by measuring how many disturbances I experience. I really like the app, the only thing is I wish it was waterproof but hey, nothing can be perfect. More realistically I’d give it a 4.5 out of 5 due to not being waterproof, but it’s not a big enough deal for me to remove a whole star.",5
1153,I switched from a Whoop tracker over to a Halo when the Halo was launched due to the lower monthly price.  I feel the Halo does an equal or better job of activity tracking and the sleep tracking feature mirrors Whoop's recovery feature in many ways.This is my second Halo band.  The first was lost playing sand volleyball using a knockoff band.  I've learned my lesson and will only be purchasing Amazon supplied bands going forward.,5
1154,"I have had mine about 3 months now. Overall I like it and ave not had any connection or reading errors, such as missing sleep graph data. I could compare it to a fitbit, one without a screen. REMEMBER this is a activity tracker NOT a smart watch. Amazon's goal was to make this one less device trying to be another device, beeping or vibrating and distracting you, as most of us already have enough of that. The body scan is interesting as I havent had that before with my multiple fitbits or Samsung active2. I am not sure if I would pay a monthly fee for stuff I could get with a one time purchase. It might be worth it for someone who uses the scan regularly( I am not sure if it is accurate, as I have nothing to compare) or the labs. I do enjoy the simplicity of the device and the functionality of the app.",5
1155,It is one of the more comfortable bands I've had. No bulky and you don't even notice you're wearing it. The only one I've been able to wear when I sleep.Heart rate and steps seem to be accurate. I've gauged them against a smasung smart watch and Google fit on my phone. The sleep monitor won't capture all nights for some reason and doesn't give you an explanation of why it didn't track on nights when there is no data.The tone and visual analysis features are creepy and seems like a waste of r&d budget.I won't continue use after the trial because it doesn't connect with any other apps and doesn't have nutrition collection capability. Easy fix is to integrate with the countless other apps out there that do thing you don't.,3
1156,"The app for this is decent enough - I especially like the sleep tracking. It's been good about catching when I'm having problems. I don't use the voice functions because I'm a mental health therapist, so if I'm doing my  job well, my tone will always be relaxed ... and If I'm doing my job well, I'm not going to use tech that records anything of what's going on.My big complaint is that the band and my skin are definitely not friends. It's left an irritated ring around it.Overall, not a great purchase, but I'm going to try to stick with it for now.",3
1157,"Hale is good, and works all good and even the voice recognition works really good as well BUT if you turn it on the battery doesn’t last a whole day, so you won’t be able to track your sleep as it will be on the charger..",5
1158,"I was excited to try the Halo band and app when it first released. Couple of reasons why I discontinued my subscription 1) The Halo App on mobile is very limited. It seems like you can only tie one device to the app. Having a way to view this on laptop or iPad besides the phone would have been key because workout plans, trends are easier to view in a large screen. ii) Several functions are limited or don't really deliver on its promise. Examples are Sleep app - I am well rested but it always shows a demotivating low score. Tone is a waste of money - it tells you nothing that is constructive or usable. Display of heart rate trends and its interpretation is quite unusable.The body measure and step counters are ok - if those are the only reasons you want to get the app.",2
1159,"I really liked the Halo and all the data it collected! I wanted something that could track my sleep patterns and it seemed to do a really good job. I thought it was a lot of fun…in the beginning. But when the novelty wore off after a couple of weeks I realized it was kind of expensive, and that’s without the membership fee. Also, I had a permanent bruise on my wrist where the halo sat, no matter how I tried to adjust or maneuver it, it was actually painful to wear! If not for that, I might’ve kept it but couldn’t see paying that much plus a membership fee for something that was causing me pain.",3
1160,"I have both a fitbit and the Halo. I wore them both at the same time for about a month and honestly, I didn't get a whole lot of new information. The sleep tracking was probably a little more accurate than fitbit's. I was most excited for the voice tracking, and it ended up being more disappointing than anything else. It doesn't explain which phrases it is tagging as a certain emotion. And upon testing it specifically while monitoring it, unless you talk like a super upbeat peppy person regularly, your voice gets registered as sad most of the time. The body scanner was a cool added part to the app, and still it didn't do much to give more information than what I could figure out on my own.",3
1161,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The app is just OK. It gives lots of good exercise tips and meal tips. The body scanning does seem to be very accurate. The only downfall is I wish it had a calorie tracker.",3
1162,"UPDATE: A year later...the sleep function from the Halo app still didn't download to the WW App- although most troubleshooting sources state they  can pair for that function.  Nothing I could do worked, and Tech support wasn't much help.AND- this morning I took it off to wash the band and the entire plate which covers the sensors and is against your skin completely fell off- the rubber/silicone edge which keeps it in place (and I guess water tight) disintegrated. So - pretty much- I got about a year of use from this..  I didn't wear it swimming, and most times took it off to shower, so it wasn't exposed to water or chlorine hardly at all.For the price, upgrade and purchase something else!I purchased this over other options because it was hyped by Weight Watchers. I’ve usually been pleased with item WW features, but this is kinda “just ok”.  I should have waited to see reviews because it  seems to be very basic in functionality.The exercise does sync easily with my WW app- which is nice, but I don’t see it syncing any of the other functions.I like the sleep tracking, but it is off tracking steps/ movement by about 5+\- % compared to my phone and pedometer .  I’ve been monitoring my speech intensity to gauge my stress level, but not sure how useful it is as a tool. It is ok comfort-wise, but I would have preferred something thinner and I like that I don’t have to take it off to shower.And my biggest complaint is it needs charging pretty much every 36 hours.  Would I recommend? Probably not.",1
1163,"I was excited to be chosen for an early invitation but extremely disappointed with the actual product.1. It’s bulky...I already use an AppleWatch so adding this was a lot going on my wrists2.  It’s actual functionality isn’t much.  It’s just a basic activity tracker with a listening feature which I couldn’t get to work.  No screen so you can’t even tell time with it.3.  Band limitations...you are stuck with the band it comes with which is sporty but ugly when outside the gym.It did have a great battery life and I did like the sleep analysis function but it really irritated my wrist keeping it on all the time.All in all, I was disappointed and if now sits in a drawer.",3
1164,Good but has flaws.On live view the heart rate monitor is consistently off the reading on my chest strap.Update after six months of use band works well for every day activities the connection issue isn’t a problem. Would be better if it had a ANT + technology to connect to a chest strap. Band alone will not keep up with any exercise.,3
1165,"I was so excited about this device I went on a waiting list to even have the opportunity to purchase. I could write a detail review, which would drag on, so I'm going to give the condensed version.  Its horribly uncomfortable, and really not super attractive. Honestly, look at the pictures, its not something you want to wear everyday.  Next, the voice ""tone"" function.  I was so uncomfortable reading the report and it saying I sounded ""angry"" at 1pm.  Drove me crazy because I kept replaying what happened at 1pm.  That function also drains the battery in no time flat.  I have zero faith in the fat scan.  Its a 3D digital image, how is that really going to give you an accurate number.  Their explanation is waist to hip measurements and blah, blah, blah...Not buying it.  I don't see any published data telling me how and why that's so much more accurate than other methods.  Last, when I first read about the device it's selling point was to keep you from being fixated on your numbers and constantly looking at your wrist.  So yea, it did that, but I was constantly looking at the app on my phone.  The app is another can of worms.  Way too much information.  The app felt like one big advertisement for additional services.Sorry, the review wasn't as short as I'd hoped.  I returned the device in 5 days because I really wanted to give it a chance.  For the record, I love my Amazon devices, but this one not only failed as a fitness app, it was just plain weird.",1
1166,"I’ve been an Apple Watch user for years. This is not an Apple Watch. As someone who is easily distracted and wanted a fitness tracker this might be it. The sleep tracker is great, the point system for exercise is a little weird, but with all the added workouts and lifestyle reminders so far so good.  One thing for sure the charging clip takes a little extra time to clip in but the battery lasts so long that an additional minute out of my day is not going to kill me. Also not sure where people are getting this but you DO NOT have to be naked for the full body scan. Tight fitting clothing (workout attire) worked for me. Seeing the body scan give you an estimate of how your body would look at different stages is definitely a huge plus for motivation for me. This little guy just allowed me to see into the future and I’m here for it.",5
1167,"I was really excited for this and was on the rolling out early access list, but it was a little underwhelming. I'm glad I didn't spend 100 for it. I think this could be a great fitness tracker for someone who is just starting and wants some help to stick with healthy habits. The heart rate tracker is ok, its no better or worse than other wrist heart rate trackers. The app is clean and easy to navigate and the body scan is nice, there is about a 2% difference between my scale body fat percentage and this. Overall I feel like the exclusivity of the roll out list and the cool video really got me. I thought it could be compared to the Whoop band because it measured intensity but I could live without this.",3
1168,I think the sleep tracking could be better. My fiance slept longer than me but had a lower score. It always says I fell asleep in 10 minutes or less when it was closer to an hour.Disappointed in how the band and tracker fit. They could have shaped it better to fit nicely with the natural shape of the wrist but it sticks out more than I feel it could. It takes a few tries to get the fit how you like it and I feel my bad got dirty very easily. I work retail so I don't see how it got discolored so easily.,3
1169,"It’s OK, but not great.Lack of integration is my biggest need with it. I feel forced to use in-app meditations or exercises that to me are not great. It doesn’t sync with apple’s Health app, so I have to track multitude of apps now. Meh.Sleep tracking is non-existent. I read before bed, and apparently I’m in “deep sleep”, when I do wake up it doesn’t register, when I don’t - it does 🤷🏻‍♀️Once when I slept I did 20 steps. (I didn’t) so I’m not confident that 1000 steps difference between my phone and Halo on a 6k steps walk is a testament to Halo. No way to check, because it doesn’t update as you do thingsOverall I’m not excited, but it reminds me to be active, I guess...",3
1170,"Been wearing for two weeks so far, definitely helps motivate. I don’t feel as though the body fat calculator is very precise however the body scans are interesting. I have a faster resting heart rate and when I am stressed/heart rate is up the band thinks I am working out when I am not sometimes. I wanted something similar to the Whoop band - similar features but a fraction of the price. Does a great job at tracking sleep.I recommend getting the black band instead of pink as it has already has started to look a little dingy.",4
1171,"I thought I would love this Halo (and at the time, I found it cheaper at Target) but, I have had constant issues charging the device as well as the accuracy seems off.I wish I could have loved this Halo.... but it's eh.",3
1172,"Halo does everything it says it does and the app is great. But I can't switch over to if from my FitBit because it doesn't have a display! I use the fitbit as a watch and check my steps constantly. I'm not going to check my phone that much. The price is great and the app has great details so if you can do without the display this might be the tracker for you. As of now, I'm still wearing the Halo and my Fitbit.",4
1173,Very easy to use and set up. I actually love that it has no screen and therefore is not distracting at all. I dont think anything will ever be 100% accurate but I can safely say that it is more accurate than my smartwatch. The app is beautifully set up and easy to read and understand. I love the health tips! The only problem I seem to have occasionally is it loses its connection to my app and double tapping the button to reconnect rarely works so I restart my phone and it connects as it should,4
1174,"I've been wearing a WHOOP strap for the past 6 months and I really like it, but the monthly subscription is pretty steep.  So when I saw Amazon was releasing a similar band with a much cheaper subscription i figured I'd give it a shot.My biggest complaint is the battery life.  if I turned on the mic to collect tone data it wouldn't even last a day.  this ""feature"" makes the whole thing worthless.  Even if the mics were turned off I was still only getting a couple days, a fitbit with a screen can do that.  the biggest issue is that you have to take it off to charge it.  either I wake up and need to charge it and I forget to put it back on, or I charge it over night and I don't get consistent sleep tracking.The app is fine, it does seem directed towards a less active person, suggesting very basic activities to get a sedentary person moving.  It does not recognize common activities, I need to tell it what I'm doing every time, It should be able to recognize what I'm doing after collecting some sample data.  also the body scan is really inaccurate.",2
1175,"If this contraption could show me my Hypnogram every day I would be very happy person. As it doesn’t, I am not. I do enjoy the aids for getting to sleep at night because they really do help but I would really like to see the graph the next day showing how I slept. I don’t need an explanation of REM sleep or deep sleep or light sleep. The definitions don’t change every day. I don’t need definitions I need a picture! Maybe that makes me juvenile but I do have time to return this halo if it doesn’t start performing better.",3
1176,I love this. I wear it on my right wrist as my Apple Watch is on my left. It is very informative. Way better fitness tracking that my Apple Watch and better than any Fitbit I’ve ever worn before.,5
1177,"Things were working well until today. The activity section on the app is wonky. It says 0 pts, but I did a long walk this morning and it is even recorded when I look at the details of my activity.  I feel like this should be an easy fix for Amazon.Update:It's been working well until now. It seems as though if I take a nap after a workout, for some reason, my workout details (including points earned) just disappears. This only happens when I take a nap about ~ hour after a workout.",4
1178,"It’s an alright device for Amazon’s first attempt at a fitness band. My main complaint is the sleep tracking. I bought this specifically to motivate me to get up and move more AND for the sleep tracking. I always like to read before bed until I get tired enough to sleep. Let’s say I stop reading at around 1am to fall asleep, I’m the morning when I check the tracker it’ll say I fell asleep around 11:30pm. It’ll show me in a light and deep sleep when I clearly knew I was still awake. So it doesn’t really help me with knowing how long it actually took me to fall asleep. It’s a little disappointing.",3
1179,"I used to have an Apple Watch but didn’t like how often I had to interact with it and charge it each night. With this, there’s no screen, automatically tracks workouts that you can label what they were later and I get 4-5 days on a charge. I’d say it’s as accurate as the Apple Watch. My heart rate and activity reading are very much the same. I don’t use the tone feature but I like the meal planner, workouts, sleep tracking and the app in general. It’s so easy to use and feels light and thin on my wrist.",5
1180,I purchased this because i loved the idea of the body composition. I love the labs and the design of the app. However I notice the accuracy isn’t very reliable. I’m a nurse working 12 hour shifts in a hospital setting so im always on my feet power walking from room to room but it counts my activity at work as mainly sedentary... i’ve reset the device and everything and it still didn’t help. Even the body scan isn’t accurate. I’ve taken multiple scans at once to see the consistency and within that same 10 minutes my body fat % has jumped between 3 whole percentages. Not impressed with the accuracy but like I said i love the labs offered. I might go back to using my fitbit for a bit until they make some updates.,3
1181,"Too uncomfortable to wear at night. Intermittent and unaccurate results during the day. the only time this worked well as far as tracking my exertions and heartrate was during the first couple of months. Unbeknownst to me stopped working several weeks ago, shows absolutely no collected data and for whatver reason can no longer verifies my account so I can reactivate the app on the device it was working on most recently. Only activates on old phone I originally set it up on, no matter how many times I deregister everywhere available (app, Amazon.com), delete data and uninstall/reinstall app. The only thing that continues to make this desirable for me access to the supplementary programs, but at this point I'd rather spend hundreds of dollars for individual memberships to than keep wasting my time and sacrificing my sanity to this piece of junk. Oh, and my free product support ended four days ago so even that isn't an option anymore for recovery. I've only had one other gadget fail me within months over a couple of decades of purchases. At least the other vendor was willing to give me a replacement.",2
1182,"For a fitness band, it looks okays.  Band is noticable and I find irritating.  Battery life is not good.  I am used to multiple days and this needs charged every 26-30 hours.  It charges quickly though.  Tone is interesting but I'd like deeper data available in the app.  Should partner with scales and other smart health items as I don't like the body scan feature.  Seems intrusive.  I am not seeing the value of 3.99/mo for the information provided, but I still have 4 months to see improvements.  I am generally an early adoptor of tech gadgets, so I had high hopes that Amazon would change the paradigm of fitness trackers like The Echo and The Cube did for home assistants.",3
1183,"I couldn't wait!! I hit the be selected for the pre-order and was given the opportunity. I changed all my workout habits, etc. However? I think its a great start, but not for me. I do very strenuous work, with my job walk about 15 miles per day. And it's just off. I've tried everything it has to offer, but I just don't like it. The voice addition? Perhaps I have been doing something incorrectly it just doesn't meet the standards it's supposed to. Trust me, I work in an environment where it's much needed. It's not for me. I won't continue. And I know that it's not a ""clock,"" so to speak, but I just keep looking at it waiting for it to show out of habit from fitbit, etc. It needs work....",3
1184,"This watch does exactly what it says, but lacks in the app. I am not sure why others say it is uncomfortable, because unlike other smart watches, I don't even remember this one is on it is so comfy. I would give it more stars if the sleep tracking was better. It gives 2 times and then little indicator ticks, but I don't know if that is an hour or 30 minutes. If I wake up and hit snooze for 30 min, I want to know the initial wake up time so being able to zoom into the data would be helpful. Also, the sleep doesn't sync with WW like the fitness points, so I have to manually enter my sleep. Not sure if that falls on WW or Amazon so it is what it is.",3
1185,"It is quite a disappointment be honest. The features are sooooo basic! I’ve been using Whoop which costs a lot more than Halo, I thought I could get off Whoop once starting using Halo.  The only feature that is useful for me is the body temperature which corresponds with my hormone cycle. It does not offer HRV tracking, no recovery score, fitness tracking is weak with very little data.The sleep track is not very accurate either. It can’t tell the difference between laying in bed reading and being asleep. It just gives me a low sleep efficiency score.Overall it’s a device for people who are not into fitness, just want to track their steps and feel accomplished.  I already stopped wearing it.  Still wearing my whoop.",3
1186,Doesn’t connect with other apps. No food logging ability.,2
1187,I don't use the voice recognition it seemed to overwhelm the app. The discover section with the sleep section is FANTASTIC.,5
1188,"UPDATE:Amazon support proactively reached out about the sleep tracking issues and sent me a replacement in January. While the sleep tracking appears to be more accurate on the replacement unit, it decided to stop charging all of a sudden after about 1.5 months. Unfortunately the return window for this item closed two weeks ago, otherwise I'd return this product for a refund rather than attempt another replacement through warranty. Just NOT worth the trouble. You buy these things for the data, and when you don't even know if you can trust the data, or if you have to charge it every day but the charging is unreliable, it fails to provide the insight that you were looking for. Product itself is one star, but an additional star for the stellar product support.The band stinks even though i wash it with detergent after every workout. Sleep tracking not as accurate as fitbit and the voice analysis is a joke- gives minimal insight (only listens in sporadically or unless you tell it to and even then not always accurate) and drains battery fast. With voice analysis on, you’ll need to recharge it every day. Won’t find out how accurate the body analysis is until my annual exam next April.",2
1189,"The bad itself looks much better than most. The app loads and syncs WAY too slow and never until you open the app. It needs movement reminders either vibrate or on the app. I measured my wrist according to the size chart and I was a size lower than they suggested... otherwise the band wraps all the way around my wrist. Get a smaller size. The body scanning seems fairly accurate, but they need a place to put your weight daily, as it keeps people motivated.",4
1190,This is not a fit bit or an apple watch. Frankly it is designed what it is suppose to do. One you slip it on it is adjustable on how tight or loose you want it. 2. It does wonders as I finally started to lose weight with it. I am an avid hiker do 13 miles on a weekend and active during work. It tracks my sleep i was not getting enough sleep. So I competed nightly to get at least 6 hours. I was getting 3 to 4 hours. I average 10k steps daily and my activity for the week is 150 to 300. So it tells you heart health.. I am not distracted by a screen. Period. I check and sync at my leisure.. That is bonus. Fitness is leisure and peace of mind. Not to constantly stress. Thumbs up. I will update with a video..,5
1191,"i love collecting data on myself and my body.. just to get to know myself more. to be able to know how i feel and why i feel this way. you know? its really nice being able to get in touch with yourself and this bracelet my not tell the time, but it looks cute and helps you to do that. i love the sleep tracker on it. i can see how i slept so i know how tired i will be during the day. sometimes i wake up super groggy but i still have a great day.. i figured out thats because i woke up during a REM cycle even though i had a really high sleep score. NOT because i had bad sleep. interesting to know!",5
1192,"This product is awesome value for money. Good accurate tracking, food suggestions, body fat calculator, workout routines, all top notch. The only negative is it doesn’t have a great UI but then the price is also very competitive",5
1193,"I wanted the reviews to be wrong. They aren't wrong. The app nit-picks your self esteem to pieces. It has this very passive aggressive way of making you feel like no matter how hard you try, you're never quite good enough for it. Today's example...It's always criticizing my sleep... like I'm sorry, I really can't control how long I'm in REM here dude. So apparently last night my sleep score was somehow satisfactory and guess what... it decided to make me feel like crap because my steps yesterday were under my average. Ok halo, I'm a teacher and yesterday I had to sit through trainings and meetings all day. I can't explain it, it just is the opposite of encouraging to me. Instead of focusing on the positive progress you're making it only points out what you need to improve. I will never be good enough for halo. I'll wear it to track my steps for my health insurance but beyond that it serves no purpose to me. I don't like it's attitude.",2
1194,I love the Halo band. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I thought I would miss having a display to check my progress but I do not. The app has so much to offer that I find myself exploring often.  I used the mobility feature and was amazed that after getting the results I was presented with a plan to improve my mobility.  My husband is also enjoying his Halo band.  He loves doing research and the app has a wealth of information for him to explore.I recommend the Halo band as it offers so much more than other fitness bands that I've tried.,5
1195,"I love ...the sleep tracking and how it breaks down my nightly patterns.the activity tracking and how it breaks down the intensity of your exercise.the meditation, exercise and other healthy programs that are available in the appI wish ...It was able to take my temperature, it reads it when I am asleep so why not when I am awake?it could take my blood pressure, which I know is not very accurate but it would show changes up and down.I don't like ...It doesn't always track sleep accurately. If you sleep on the arm it stops reading.The band gets dirty and you will never get it like new clean again.I took my Heart Rate while the watch took my Heart Rate and I found it to be close but not accurate.Overall it's a great product and Amazon has been updating it.",5
1196,"I was an early access user of the Halo.Likes - with the pink band, it disappears on my wrist, and is comfortable to wear, even when I am sleeping.  Admittedly, the number of people pale enough for this to happen is on the low side, and very everyone else the pink band is going to look like a lumpy bandage.Dislikes - I can't edit the Sleep record, so If I get up in the middle of the night to read, the time is recorded as ""Sleeping"" and cannot be corrected.  I can't seem to find a history of stuff like heart rate - yeah, it's cool to know my heart rate is elevated right now, but how long has it been like that?  No O2 sat measurement.Hates - I have to basically re-boot the thing after recharging or it won't sync with my phone.  I should be able to slap it on, and go, but instead I push buttons, push them again, press and hold, give up, etc.I bought this with the monthly installments, and I don't think I've even paid it off, but I'm tossing it in a drawer and looking for something else.",2
1197,"I like the sleep monitor and heart rate monitor. The values are pretty accurate.I don't use the microphone or BMI.One thing I don't like is app could use a little more polish (at least on Android)1. When watching workout videos the screen turns off, so I can't check the upcoming exercises. I noticed that this only happens in single workout video, not in program videos.2. No streaming of workout videos to chromecast, I have to watch them on my tiny phone when working out?",4
1198,"Update:  I have officially being wearing this for 7 weeks.  I adore this.  It has improved my sleep, I have started to become more physically active, and I love the tracking of those things.  I really like how it rewards for activity based on heart rate and negates inactivity.  I have completed several of the labs and the available work out videos.  One of the best things is that my kids have joined me in the work outs and have fun doing them as a family.  I am a numbers person and this has provided me real information about my day that is now inspiring me to do better.  Lastly I love that it focuses on a 2 week body scan verse the normal weight measurement.  Honestly have only lost about 2 lbs but my body composition is changing and that is a huge incentive right now.",5
1199,The device itself is pretty good.  I find it was reasonably accurate and the fit is great.  I never really realize I have it on.  Having a clock on the band would be nice but don't want to mess with the weight if that happened.BUT THE CHARGER...It's the worst charger I've ever dealt with.  I get up in the morning and take it off first thing to charge.  And then the dance begins of trying to get it to fit on the charger just right so that it engages.  Just painful.,3
1200,"I absolutely love the Halo! I tried a fitbit but it was bulky, awkward and uncomfortable. The Halo is sleek, stylish and comfortable and I forget I even have it on. The app is easy to use and has some great features to help motivate my activity. It charges quickly and the battery lasts for several days. I take mine off and charge it when I shower so it never goes dead. I disabled the mic to save battery but it is a neat feature to have. Plus the Halo is very affordable! It reminds me a lot of my husband's Whoop but at a fraction of the price. I haven't done the BMI simply because I am not trying to track that but again, another neat feature. I think it is so great that I just ordered my mom one for Christmas!  I also ordered myself a second band. I would definitely recommend getting one!",5
1201,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 As someone who has used Fitness Trackers, my favorite being FitBit (except when they break the same time every year), I wanted to try something different with Amazon's Halo. It's very different from other trackers and you may like or dislike these features. I'll update my review if my experience changes.- No face, clock, thing on your wrist to look at. You see everything on the mobile app which works with Droid and Apple.- After 6 mo $3.99 a month subscription to get all the features, including classes, labs, meditation, all the bundled analytics. A lot of Fitness Trackers charge individually.- There are AI components like Tone (you can switch it off).- It asks for photos that it doesn't store but uses to improve accuracy. You don't need to include your face.- Utilizes body temperature for sleep accuracy.- Isn't distracting, however if you're used to looking at your tracker for statistics, you'll need to look at the app instead.- Very comfortable.",5
1202,"Thought I might try this as an alternative to my Apple Watch but going to toss this in the garbage where it belongs. Here’s why:1) As shown in the picture, the band causes some sort of rash on my skin from extended use which took about 12-24 hours of wearing to develop... and it’s not the normal imprint that you might see if you press an object against your skin too long. Presumably this is from the green LEDs but not entirely sure. Seems to be violating consumer safety standards if this issue is widespread...2) It’s not bulky but it is uncomfortable. Definitely not something I enjoy wearing to sleep which defeats the purpose of the sleep tracking function.3) They use cheap tactics to keep you paying a recurring membership fee. In the app settings you aren’t allowed to edit your membership (which is a simple feature)... instead they make this statement: “To manage or cancel your membership, please contact Amazon customer service.” Furthermore, they put you in a “free membership period” before starting to charge you and hide the time remaining. These are ploys you’d expect from a cheap car salesman and quite frankly unexpected from Amazon, who parades its customer first mantra.4) Clip on charger is impractical and terrible. It’s excessively oversized and you need to set the band in just the right orientation to get it charging. The designer must have thought that it was super clever and would stand out from other products but it just sucks. Plain and simple.Only real positive thing is the mobile app. Guess that’s why they pay the software engineers well.",1
1203,"I absolutely love the Amazon Halo band and app. I'm actually able to get a visual perception of my health and lifestyle.. the videos chosen for me in the app such as the type of yoga, meditation, all types of exercise from begginers to experts. I absolutely would never chose another device. The only thing that I think needs improvement is when Halo band is disconnected it tell you in the app to double press the button on the band but that hasn't worked out for me so when I have to reconnect it if the Bluetooth doesn't work on reconnecting in I have to do a whole factory reset, then everything is started all over like I had to do when setting it up.. I know all y'all will love the Amazon Halo band for sure..",5
1204,"Really like the halo!! Comfortable and easy to track/use. The only additional thing I wish it had was time. It would be helpful so that I could see the time when I'm at work, working out or running errands... it would be nice to just look at the halo for the time so you don't have to wear a watch separately or look for your phone to see what time it is.",4
1205,"I've had this for almost a month. I love that this doesn't have another screen. It does what I wanted it for - tracks my steps and sleep. I don't use to tone analyzer. I can't say it's super accurate, but gives me a good understanding of where I am and how to improve. I'm a fan.-----------I've had this for a while now. I do love that it tracks my activities and sleep. Once my membership expired I tried to reactivate it but it's really hard to figure out how to do without having to contact someone - and I haven't had time to do it yet. Also, it burned me. I'm waiting for my skin to heal and I'll try again... Maybe",3
1206,"UPDATE: I'M LIVID! 7 months ago it was NOT clear that I would loose most functionality after my free trail was over!  I was fine losing access to the exercise programs, meditations, (discover) etc BUT NOT the sleep and activity data!!!!  Honestly this is not worth it then, and I'm wondering if I can get a refund!  There was no monthly subscription fee for my fitbit! Seriously Amazon can I get my money back!  you can have ur 0 star garbage back!  DO NOT BUY!!!!So since this is still in beta, here are some things I hope you improve:-add a digital clock along the side without the button like the Samsung Edge display, or have it verbally tell you the time at the button press (or some other action- wrist spin?).-give the watch a vibrate functionality for alarms/alerts/notifications.-add the halo app to the Amazon app store so I can login and watch videos from Kindle Fire or Fire stick/TV (with username & password).-make it easier to confirm that a lab was completed.-remove the limit/cap for the number of labs you can 'subscribe' to-make a goals function, like what would I need to change to lose 2lbs a week, how much exercise should I add?-add the actual time to the sleep readouts.- it's not good at picking up naps, or if I go back to sleep-READ the reviews before saying contact for IT support, my app review had said that my issue was already resolved after a factory reset... but then the response was 'We'd like to help you troubleshoot ' ... so that made no sense.",1
1207,"It was working fine for about two weeks, now when I try to charge it, it will not charge.",3
1208,I really prefer something I can see on my wrist rather than on my cell phone.  Also order a different colored band as the silver one gets dirty pretty fast.  I have not tried the voice part as the battery goes down fast enough without using that application.,4
1209,"I purchased this during the prerelease at a special price and was very excited about the features. I picked the blush and rose gold and it looks more like a cloth bandaid color but it’s fine. I watched my tones for a few days and although it’s fun, I am a sarcastic person and it often thinks I am upset when I am joking. Didn’t really provide much so I turned that option off as it is a real battery drainer. I do like tracking my sleep. Helps me understand why I’m extra tired some mornings. I do like that it’s not a watch and a simple tracker so it’s not distracting. Other than counting my activity and watching my sleep, I wouldn’t have gotten much out of this and wouldn’t have paid full price. When the free membership is up, I will probably look into purchasing a different tracker. As you can see from my pictures, the tracker does dig into your wrist a bit as well. The charger is also fickle so you have to make sure it’s lined up exactly. I would say pass and get something a little more accurate, comfortable fitting and one that you don’t have to pay a monthly subscription fee.",2
1210,"I hope Amazon develops this product further, because right now what it offers doesn't set it apart enough from other fitness products. Most of what it does, other devices do just as well and have the benefit of a screen so you don't have to check the app to learn what's happening. The body scans are a great feature, and the voice monitor is also interesting, but I haven't found either to be terribly insightful yet. I continue to wear it, mainly in support of this product that I hope will grow with time.",4
1211,"I was really excited to try this and wanted to love it.  On the positive side, the band is extremely comfy and lightweight, I often forget I have it on.  But that's the only major pro so far.  The amount of time I have to spend inputting data is ridiculous.  It only auto tracks activities about a 3rd of the time.  Even the workout classes that I take through the Halo App are rarely recognized.  Sleep tracking is decent however seems flawed as well since it tracks I'm sleeping even if I'm up late reading or swiping on my phone.  The body scan is kind of a joke.  Not a fan, will be switching back to my Fitbit.",3
1212,"I like the information it provides. It doesn't measure the flights of stairs or hills I climb, but what it measures in sleep and speaking tone are so interesting.I quickly replaced the band that had to be slipped over my hand because it doesn't fully open with a rubber one that does. Now I wear the tracker always except while it is charging or I am bathing.Measuring my tone is the most interesting feature. I also enjoy it measuring how my body temperature changes while I sleep and number of sleep disturbances.I don't think it is as accurate in step count as my fitbit, but I can't know for sure. The information it provides is helpful and accurate enough is all we can expect from trackers, anyway.The mobile app is intuitive for me so easy to use and helpful.",5
1213,Like the device  a lot. I like the fact that it is faceless. It allows my to still wear a watch. My major complaint is with the membership. There doesn't seem to way to watch the videos online instead of on my phone. The second issue is there doesn't seem to be a way to search the videos. Finally it would be nice to be able to convert the steps into miles.,4
1214,"So I have had it for over a year. I love it for the scans and the crazy accuracy of my sleep!Unfortunately my watch has died and I am not sure why?!?!? It's just DIED!But if it didn't just DIE, it would a total 5 out of 5 for me.(FYI I am not a fan of traditional smart watches).",3
1215,"the device does not track steps, it ""calculates"" steps, for me, they are always incorrect.  I work third shift and this uses a clock that resets at midnight, so my ""work time"" is never calculated correctly.  it gives no reminders when you are sedentary too long, and even if you are up and moving and doing things if your heart rate isn't high enough and the GPS telling it you are making substantial movement it will count that time as you being a lazy slob.  so doing dishes and cleaning the house is considered ""sedentary"" unless you are doing jazzercise at the same time.  why is that so bad?  becasue it takes ""points"" that it uses to ""motivate"" you away if you are not keeping your heart rate up and keeping your GPS active a minimum of 8 hours a day.this might have been amazing when I was in the army, but today it's just a demotivating distraction on my arm that makes me keep looking at it for the time when there is no watch there.  I got this early for a discounted price, and I still consider it wasted money.",2
1216,"Overall I like this band. I mainly monitor my sleep and activity. I used the tone feature in the beginning but since it drains the battery much quicker, I disabled it. I like the fact that it doesn't have a screen...that was one is the main reasons I purchased it HOWEVER I really really wish they added a watch feature to it kind of like the echo dots have now. I hate having to wear a watch separately. Otherwise, I'm happy with it and can't wait to see what other features they'll add.",4
1217,"I have truly enjoyed my halo band! I purchased mine through the 2021 Prime day sale!  I love all the features and additional insights on my physical well-being. I initially had an issues where my hand wouldn’t charge, I contacted Amazon support and within a few messages they sent me a new one that I received in 2 days and just returned the defective one. A lot of the complaints I see on this band are silly- no it’s not an Apple Watch. I use mine in additional to my watch and I believe between the two I have increased how active I am and I’m more aware about my body and overall health! I recommend it if you’re wanting to try something new !!",5
1218,"I like the concept, design, app, etc but there’s a big bug that might make me return it. The whole concept and point system is based off of heart rate zones, which was a big reason I bought it, but it is clearly not very accurate. I was doing hard floor workouts, breathless, heart pounding, and the live heart rate monitor says my heart rate is.. 80. This has been the case for a few weeks, so today I used my peloton heart rate monitor and did it by hand and my heart rate is in the 150-160 range while this reads 80. When I bike it seems accurate but floor exercises/weights it does not pick up. Wonder if this is a software push or a hardware issue",3
1219,"I brought Halo for the Body Scan function. Almost all body fat tests on the market (including body scans) show that my body fat percentage is between 12-15%. Halo says 28%+. My BMI is only 24. I go to the gym six times a week, and I can squat more than twice my body weight (doubtful being skinny fat). I think 28% is unlikely to be accurate.Besides, sleep monitoring cannot detect short daytime sleep. Halo will consider a nap as Sedentary time and deduct points for your Activity.Finally, although I don’t want too much information to disturb me, I still think time display is a valuable feature. After all, Halo occupies my wrist position; I hope it can provide a function to replace my mechanical watch.",3
1220,"It looks great, but I can't understand why they didn't put a clock on the face of it.  That and the Tone feature is highly inaccurate and does not pick up on sarcasm or a lot of intonation.  The sleep feature seems good and I do love the body scan fuction on the app.  The Activity recorder also seems inaccurate, I guess unless you are walking or running it does not pick up on other activity, I do more strength training right now and it shows like I sit on the couch all day.  The different features such as work outs, and other articles to help improve your ""points"" are nice but you can easily find on YouTube or Google as well.",3
1221,"The only fitness tracker I’ve used before the Halo is the Fitbit so I’m no expert. I do really like the Halo. Pros:The lookThe supporting phone app features of body scan, body fat %, variety of workouts, sleep tracking, heart rateHistory of above features is retained for referenceCons:I wish I could repeat workout programs as trackable programs (maybe you can and I just don’t know how to do it. Instead, I just go back to my history and manually choose individual workouts from a program I’ve previously completed)I have stopped wearing it to bed. I find it a bit bulky and the green light it emits from inside the band is annoying in the dark of nightEven with the cons I am really satisfied and happy with the Halo. It gives me an extra kick of motivation to keep moving and pursuing good health.",5
1222,"I like the concept of this band but don’t think it’s hit its potential yet.  This band only will give you points if your heartbeat is pretty elevated.  So for yoga or weight training exercises, you can do a 20-30 minute workout that is challenging and you are sore from but receive little to no points but a walk around the grocery store gives you 25 points.  The goal is to hit 150 points a week.  So if you do cardio, you’re golden but if work out in other ways, you’ll never achieve your goal.For sleep, I find it’s mostly accurate.I haven’t tested the tone feature.Comfortable to wear and long battery life.",3
1223,"I got this because I thought it might give more insight on my behaviors than the rest of the fitness gadgets on the market. Hasn't panned out so far. The big hype about it was the ""tone"" evaluation. Personally, I think it's just a tool for Amazon to collect data for their Alexa line of products.Not sure why there's a subscription fee for this. I'm not getting anything for the fee that I can figure. It does what it's supposed to do, but so does the amzfit neo that I also wear for comparison. The most annoying thing about it is having to charge it every day. For something with no screen, you'd think the battery would last waaay longer. It will last longer than a day, but not quite two. And the charger contraption is is one of those ""why?!"" stupid designs; kinda like a clothes pin, pops out of your fingers, then fiddle a bit, till, finally! it starts charging. Uhg!I use it for sleep and exercise. The Amazfit Neo seems to be much more accurate.Update: (5/9/21) Read this article and cancelled my subscription; ""Shhhh, they're listening-inside the coming voice-profiling revolution"" 4/28/21 by Joseph Turow, theconversation.com",2
1224,"After going thru a fitbit a year for 2 years, i got a halo for a fraction of the price of a fitbit and i love it. Great look, super comfortable band that is secure and does not fall off. Great app.",5
1225,"I used to love my halo, but all the sudden it stopped charging. I used 2 different charges and 2 different plugs and got nothing. There is no support or any way to get it foxed. This is total bull crap.UODATE: About 10 minutes after I posted this Amazon called me to trouble shoot my issue. They couldn’t so they are replacing it. I was very surprised.",4
1226,"Picked this up as I use an Apple Watch but charge it at night so I wanted something for sleep tracking.  It seems to work decently for that.  Gives the usual stats of how long it takes to fall asleep, the amount of time you spend in different levels of sleep/awakeness, etc.The step tracking seemed a bit high compared to my Apple Watch, sometimes double, but that was probably just because I was wearing the Halo on my dominant wrist.  The app is easy to use and navigate and pretty full of recommendations which I didn't really dive into.  The points system is interesting, but felt somewhat out of whack.  One week I had 200+ points by Tuesday, and some weeks I just barely make the 150.  My work is pretty physical, but it doesn't typically vary that drastically.The reason for the one star is the charger clip.  It's garbage.  It takes several attempts to get the band properly seated to start charging and then sometimes will stop charging randomly because it doesn't lock into place in any meaningful way.  I bought my band in January and last week it stopped charging the band altogether.  I reached out but got the ""Sorry it's past 30 days so we can't do anything for you"" and there's no replacement charging clips for sale on Amazon so I basically have an overpriced paperweight now.It's sad, there was a lot of potential here, but definitely got ripped off and wouldn't recommend anyone else buy one until the charger's are overhauled.",1
1227,"I will be returning. the Halo. I prefer the instant information available on the FitBit screen. I like to see how many steps I have gone at several points during the day and I am not always in the position where I can pull out my phone to pull up the app.  The wrist band is a bit big and uncomfortable. I have a small wrist so I have to put it on pretty tight to have it in the location it suggests. I was pretty excited when it came out because I am a WW member, but it doesn't seem to do anything else the fitbit doesn't already do for me - except charge a monthly fee. Sorry - I really did want to love it.",3
1228,"I have had my tracker about 6 weeks. I purchased this tracker for the body scan feature.  Then I discovered that scanning apps are available online.  I have had 3 incidents of the tracker disconnecting from my phone. Besides the fact that you can only view your info on the phone.  So, if your purchase this tracker, be aware that all it does is record data, doesn't even give you the time.  Another thing I noticed is that two days ago it would not switch to today from yesterday.All and  all I am not sure if I am keeping it.  I even purchased it at the rate of 69.99, but I am not sure if it is worth it.",3
1229,"It does everything that it says and maybe too well. Only 3 stars because I can't turn off the ""points"" that you get for activity or subtracted for being sedentary. In an ideal world, yeah, I'd only be still the 8 hours I'm supposed to be sleeping but that's not gonna happen. Otherwise, it works great and I really enjoy the insights to my sleep.",3
1230,"Some of you whine about the pettiest things. The Halo is cheap, at $100 initial and only $4 a month for all of these features. You could get the competitor for $30 a month?I LOVE that is has no screen. I’m not constantly checking it to see what I’m doing. I don’t find checking where I’m at during a workout helpful, I find it a distraction. The band is too tight or too loose? Get a different one! I have an Apple Watch which I still wear on my other wrist for notifications. The Halo is insightful. I can see how I slept, instant heart rate, BMI, and helpful videos for $4 a month!! I’ve been waiting for something like this to be release. Amazon knew it can’t compete with Apple compatibility so it didn’t try and that’s genius. Instead they made a product you could use in conjunction and I love it.",5
1231,"Sleep tracking and the tone are really the only useful features. While this product does have hundreds of skills, I haven’t found any use for them.On another note, while the tone is on, it drains the battery about 3x faster. Considering this is one of the only useful features, it’s a real shame.Charging is also another thing. I have been wearing the halo for about 2 weeks now. I need to charge it everyday. While I only need to charge it for about an hour or two, it gets super frustrating because putting it on the charger is very finicky. Most of the time it doesn’t want to charge, so I have to mess around with it for a minute or two to get it charging.",3
1232,"I had a stressful time connecting the band to my iPhone. After a failed attempt to get hold of customer support I left a one star review and someone called me. The issue was with my phone not being updated. So don’t forget to update the app and phone. The app has worked ok after connecting with a little bit of a learning curve.I’ll re-write my review after a few weeks of use.So far I’m disappointed with the battery life usefulness with the “tone” feature on. You’ll have to charge the device within 1-2days. With having to recharge the device every night, it will disrupt the sleep monitor feature or any other record while it’s charging....I will see how long it takes to 100% recharge.",3
1233,"I was so excited to try this but very disappointed. I LOVE the sleep tracking. It's the best feature! The body imaging is pretty cool too. Other than that, I can do everything and more on my Apple Watch (haven't tried to sleep tracking on the watch yet). I've been wearing this for over a month and the band is already showing wear. I got the white (really it's gray) band and it is looking dingy. It's not a nice enough accessory to wear with nice clothing so I take it off often. I saw that there are new band options so that might persuade me to wear it more often if I loved it. Overall, there's just nothing great about the Halo, in my opinion.",3
1234,"This is the first time I have ever been disappointed in an Amazon product. I think you just rolled this one out too soon. It has many quirks. I will hang on and see if they are fixed. The sleep feature thinks every time I call it a day and set and read or watch tv I have gone to sleep. It constantly thinks I go to bed at 7-8pm. I am convinced the step counter is off. I had a fitbit flex that counted steps perfectly. I could count out 100 steps and my fitbit increased by 100 steps. This does not. I know my activity in my office and it takes way more than 700 to get through my morning. I turned off the Tone feature because it could not distinguish my moods. It said I was sad when I was just being matter of fact, and other things misinterpreted. However, I called Customer Service and they were AWESOME to work with. They helped me understand many things about the Halo. I continue to wear it and will for awhile longer to see if Amazon amps up the progress and gets the quirks out.",2
1235,"I love this thing! I really do, and the app is fantastic! The battery does drain a bit too fast for my liking and the charger can be fickle and a pain to set up but it is fantastic otherwise! I have super sensitive skin and just as I had hoped, the surface is comfortable enough yo not cause me agony! I'd recommend",4
1236,"This item does exactly what is advertised.  Comfortable fit,  app is easy to use.  Good price... I figured I would wear it with no problem,  which I do. Didn't realize I would miss the watch face.  Feels like a watch so I forget sometimes,  and then look at it and realize it's not a watch.  Voice recognition drains the battery very quickly (2.5 days) .",3
1237,"Well I bought it for the tonal analysis. Thought it would be cool and it was, for a few days.  The analysis is accurate but I don’t think it tells you anything you don’t know how you sound.  The sleep tracker and the report is great, I find it to be the most stand out feature.  Activity tracker is no different than any fitness band.  The body fat analysis a weird, I think it’s accurate but I won’t be scanning (taking picture of) myself frequently.Overall a good useful device but I really wish it has a display to tell time.  Wearing a bad 24x7 and can’t use it to tell time is a lost opportunity.",3
1238,"EDITED 5/1/2021I absolutely love the Halo, but I'm on my FOURTH one..The replacement I received in November 2021 failed in April. Unfortunately, the device was no longer under warranty and I opted to buy another.Why? Because, I love it when it works!!The original purchased:11/19/20Replacement: 4/16/21*Replacement: November 2021Each time, the sensor cover came off and the device wouldn't work (connect, detect HR).I love the tracking and all of the resources, just wish it was more reliable, durable.",3
1239,"Pros: I find it very easy to use. It's comfortable on the wrist and easy to remove. It charges quickly and I like not having a screen.The Sleep tracking is thorough..Cons:The app is buggy. It often crashes when I scroll down to see my daily steps and calories summary. Sometimes it just crashes when first opened.The activity tracker seems very inconsistent. I walk several times a day on the same path with a consistent stride and yet my activity points per walk can vary wildly from walk to walk.Sleep score can change during the day. I check my sleep score when I first wake up.  If I check again later in the day sometimes the score has changed even though I haven't gone back to sleep or even laid down.The interface is bloated with stuff I'm not interested in.  I just use it to track my workout performance, to evaluate my sleep and check my heartrate.  So most of the gui is useless to me.",2
1240,This is a game changer for me.I’ve used different tracking apps for steps and sleeping but with no real accurate info. I’m blown away by what I’m learning about myself  in less then 2 weeks of wearing my Halo. I put myself thru the movement program and received corrective workouts to do for 2 weeks and then retest. The app was spot on identifying areas that I’ve had physical therapists work on in the past. Recommends that you do mobility tests every two weeks to gauge your progress and I’ll be doing that in next few days. For those that are worried Amazon is monitoring them…your scans etc can be immediately deleted.  Showed my spouse several of the workout  recommendations and we’re now ordering Halo for him!,5
1241,I bought this to monitor my sleep. I use the activity tracker to motivate myself to keep moving.,5
1242,What I love:Activity Points (about to have my first 600 week- when I started 150 was hard to get with wfh).Body Scanall of the many data points it teaches youtracks sleep better than a Fitbitgraphics & educationthe BMR calculations are spot onTone FeatureWhat needs work:The tone feature is great but it drains the battery like crazy so I disabled it.,4
1243,"I'm loving the Halo. I've used fitbits and apple watches for years, but the Halo is so much easier and tracks everything I do. Was kind of nervous for the tone tracker, but hey I guess I was right when I said that I was always frustrated at work.",5
1244,"Great medical band that looks and feels like a medical band.Pros:1. Good and accurate sleep, steps, and body fat tracking2. Lasts about 5 days and fully charges in about 2 hours3. Very nice and simple approach in regards of tracking important health things.Cons:1. It doesn't feel like a fancy accessory at all rather something you wear while staying in a hospital.2. No wristwatch option.",4
1245,"Comfortable to wear, after a month I turned off the voice monitor, it was interesting but took up too much battery life. Definitely monitors sleep well, sometimes if I sit still to read, thinks I’m asleep.",5
1246,I got this as a Whoop replacement.....it seems to do the job except for it does not charge as it should....,3
1247,"I already own a Fitbit Charge 3 but I was intrigued by the tone and body scan features and decided to give Halo a try. After a full week of trying it I am going back to my Fitbit. Halo is good and inexpensive but I didn’t find the Tone feature to be particularly informative and the body scan feature is interesting but it doesn’t need the wearable , just pictures from your cell phone. The main thing that made me go back to Fitbit was Halo’s poor battery. Fitbit Charge 3 can last for a full week while Halo was empty after 1-2 days. The Tone feature is the biggest energy consumer and can be turned off but then why would one switch from Fitbit.",3
1248,"I have been wearing the device since April of 2021 and I’m not sure why I still am. I mainly bought this to help track my calories burned and heart rate during my workouts. Writing this review from that perspective, I have to give it one star. From a cardio aspect, over 100 times I have had very intense workouts with very high heart rates. Only to get feedback saying my Hr only got up to 115 for example during a hard core HIIT workout. Anyone who does those knows this is very inaccurate. I just got off a 30 minute HIIT bike ride as I’m writing this with terrible feedback data even after starting the workout under the cycling tab. If I could do it over again I would buy a Whoop band. I have literally heard nothing but great real life reviews from people I know that have them. Please note from my picture, the end of the workout is where I went the fastest pace and had a higher HR. And once I ended the workout and hit finish, it said my live HR was only 60 as I was gasping for air….",1
1249,"One maybe 2 weeks until the metal sides start to dig in, due to foam insides sliding ....still I have bought like 8 of them ..but they should last longer ...2 broke from I guess over bending them.  4 inside foam moved and sides start being ""sharp"" ..not cuts just not good feeling. 1 the glued on outside plastic came off.Better quality please ...one in box for next time",2
1250,I love amazon products - my echos are amazing and the ring alarm system is excellent.  The halo band is NOT amazing.  Amazon has a ways to come to get anywhere near fitbit - if you don't have the monthly membership then you don't get that many stats.  Sure fitbit might be more expensive out the gate but not having to rely on a monthly membership will add up over time.  Things to definitely take into consideration before buying.,2
1251,"I really like the halo band; it's comfortable to wear and there are some good band options available. One issue is that it makes a high pitched squeal when charging. I'm not sure whether i have a defective one or not, but it seems to be recharging ok, aside from the noise.  Overall just a small annoyance and everything else is great about it.",4
1252,"I've had my band for shoot 5 days now and I'm really not impressed.The biggest drawback for me had been the battery life. It is absolutely horrible. It lasts about a day in most cases due to the tone recognition. You can set it to only record at a specific time daily, but then it's not helping you much at that point. And because the battery consistently needs to be recharged I'm unable to wear it for the sleep tracking.The reason I got this was due to how accurate I had heard the fat % is. However, that uses your phones camera and information you put in, much more so than the band itself.Also, the tone recognition just has my tone at neutral for 90% of the day..... So it's not really telling me anything.For all this and it didn't even tell you the time in it, it just really doesn't feel with it. Especially since there's a subscription fee the majority of the features.I'd recommend passing this one.",2
1253,I am not a gym person but I am someone who jogs outside when the weather is nice and does home workouts. The Amazon Halo is a great beginner tool to help out with  making sure your getting your steps or working out with its point system. The only thing  that doesn't seem to function correctly is the sleep function would sleep for 8 hours and get a score of 65 but when I sleep 6 hours would get a 90 and I would feel more tired.,4
1254,"This had a lot of potential and was a lovely, sleek little design to wear, but the points system can be tough for office-desk jobs. I was also surprised by how much I missed the social element of participating in challenges. Amazon, consider getting that element in there, too! You'd do amazing with that, especially if you pair up walking challenges with audiobooks or podcasts.",4
1255,"it tracks sleep pretty well, the tone can be wrong sometimes if you have a pretty monotone voice, and the activity tracker is very accurate.pros - small, light, battery life is good (2 days without tone)cons - can leave a red mark where the sensor is if you leave it on for too long, it's sometimes hard to get on and off becuase of the way the strap placed. it can be uncomortable if you leave it on for long periods of time.",4
1256,Was very interested in the sleep application which reveals some very interesting things about the sleep you are getting.  Fitness application is informative...unless you don’t want to know how sedentary you have become.  Voice tone...not so sure about...and the body scan makes me nervous even though they assure you the photo gets deleted off their cloud....not that you are without clothing but some of us are shy especially finding someone to take the picture. I really want my son to try it too especially for the sleep analysis.,4
1257,"I got this one for my wife on November 2020. She is been very please with all the features and the way it feats her wrist. She enjoys the sleep score feature and the other things that this halo band has to offer. but recently in fact today 6/6/2021 almost seven months of owning it the USB charging clip stop working. she keeps this charging device on her table next to her comfy chair it is a safe place and out of the way..... so we are just surprise this thing only lasted almost seven months. Oh well, i don't know if any body reads this reviews who can do something about this. all and all she is delighted with this halo gadget.",3
1258,"I actually liked the band, for the most part. It was a bit energy hungry (charge every other day) and the chunky profile was less great, but the halo app was pretty nice. After three months it broke.I thought that maybe the lack of direct interactivity (no watch face, apps, etc.) would mean I spent less time noticing I had a fitness tracker, but I just wound up looking at my phone more often. It was mostly comfortable, but my previous fitbits were all more comfortable than this was.Today (after trying to charge it) I noticed that the plastic window that sits between the wrist and light source came detached, which seems to be enough for the halo to break. Let me clear, I am not as active as I could be.... *cough* , so I can't ascribe it abuse/misuse.  I would be mad but I am more relieved that I can opt out of the subscription program and explore other  options. Possibly these will be more expensive but of a higher build quality?Hit me up on the next innovation Amazon, this one was an admirable try.",2
1259,"Really like my Halo, comfy to wear, can wear in shower, really like the Heart rate monitor and the Sleep quality feature. Seems to be accurate.Not Crazy about how long it takes to charge AND battery life is OK, just wish battery life was more than 2 &1/2 days. BUT, I don't use the Tone feature (weird??) and not comfortable with doing the body fat scan feature (yet?)Still, for the money it does a good job keeping track of my activities. Overall, so far happy with it.",4
1260,"Always unlinks. And now I have not been able to connect it back even with resetting. Yes the battery is charged.I wouldn’t recommend this device, it is very annoying. And that I have to pay monthly for things I get free with others.I will not be using halo.",2
1261,"Nice band for sleep tracking with about a 5 day battery life as long as the voice recognition is not active. I can tell why I wake up pretty tired most mornings now. The voice recognition drains the battery super fast and wasn't a feature that I really needed. The mobile app offers nice exercise and other routines to use. The biggest downside to the band is that it doesn't have a clock feature on the band itself, so I have to wear another item.",4
1262,"This  was definitely not what I was looking for. So it will be a gift for someone in my family after I restore it to factory settings. I'd like to get my information on my arm if I tap and look on my arm, to be backed up on my mobile device. This is not the one for me. Maybe someone else may like it but it was a bit too complicated.",3
1263,"The sleep tracking is great. I like the way the app lays out ho my night went, which is usually very poor. I now know that I am getting less than 6 hours of sleep a night. That is important. The voice print thing is a gimmick as I use it only once in a while for fun. The whole body composition thing is not for me as I do not like pictures of myself and do not want to share it with a computer, so I never tried that. One suggestion is to have the time displayed on it so it can act like a watch. Another suggestion is to track oxygen levels for a better sleep.",3
1264,"My boyfriends device had charging problems from the start.Mine worked / charged for a year, no problems.Recently, it's nearly impossible to align it on a charger to start charging - and even then, it stops after 20 min until I push the button on the side.On the plus side, I don't use tone features and one full charge lasts me almost a week.So I'm not impressed with Halo, but not mad either.",3
1265,"I picked this band up in early access, because I was excited to try out the BMI feature it has. Sadly, that's more to do with the app than the actual band. The band itself is pretty comfortable, very basic. No screen, just a button and a microphone. Kind of bland, if I'm honest. The app is alright, the BMI thing is cool, if a little invasive, and the speech analysis is also kind of cool. But it loses its intrigue almost immediately. Good for a quick gimmick, but ultimately has less features than other bands on the market place. Not worth paying the monthly fee to use the app. Personally, I'll be sticking to my Samsung Active Smartwatch.",3
1266,"I bought this because I liked that it wasn’t like a traditional Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc with a face and was more incognito with just the band. It worked fine for the first few months but now it’s become such a pain. It holds a charge horribly, when I first got it I was charging it once a week and now I have to charge it every other day. I would happily deal with that but it doesn’t calibrate my steps automatically anymore, I have to pull to refresh sometimes 15 times before it syncs and all my steps are showing. Not ideal if you are using it to track your steps/exercise and make sure you’re on track for your daily goals. My band currently hasn’t updated in over 4 hours, no matter how many times I restart it won’t recalibrate. So I wouldn’t recommend this product if you are looking for something to help you with tracking your health goals!",2
1267,"Sleep data is not accurate.  Most mornings it shows I slept maybe 3 hours and shows that I was awake most of the night.  The battery life is terrible, if you use it for any of the ""live"" features you can expect it to maybe last 3 or 4 hours.  Not using the live features I still have to charge it everyday.  I reached out to customer support and was told to reset the tracker.  Even resetting it didn't help.  I contacted customer service again but did not get a response.  I am going back to Fitbit.",3
1268,"The features I loved, it had a good battery life. But I have a small wrist and the computer portion was wider than my wrist and it hurt to wear. You have a square hard piece against your arm that is not flat. I wore it for one day before returning because my wrist hurt. The concept of it is great, but needs a better design.",3
1269,"I really like the sleep tracking feature, and the meditations to help with sleep. I also have become more aware of how much I do or don't move around during the day.",5
1270,"I used this for several months and in the beginning I enjoyed the analysis of the tone of my voice. However, that also felt a bit intrusive too. Granted, you can also turn that feature off. The charging of the device was daily and sometimes hard to get in the charger just right.  It also took a while for such a small device and of course any time you aren't wearing it, it's not tracking. Those things being said I really did like the sleep tracker and felt it was accurate.  Those little sheep going across the screen were so cute when calculating your hours and quality of sleep! LOL",3
1271,"Keep in mind that this is a service incomparable to any other smart watche or fitness tracker. They are trying to build an experience, but this is very much in the infancy of said experience. This is an experiment.With purchase, you will be a guinea pig, which shouldn’t be a deterrent as great things need to be tested. But this is not yet great...The developers are relying too much on game theory. It's getting people to want to improve the sleep or working out number is not enough. But they’re not offering a worthwhile utility and value beyond that silly number.If the sleep score tracker could act more like the phone app Sleep Time and wake me up when I’m in the light cycle then this would’ve worth every penny.As far as the workouts go, the free classes are just extra glitter they threw into the app. If you already workout daily with another app (like peloton) then these are redundant flourishes.As far as meditation, if you already meditate daily (I pay for headspace). This app has a few Headspace (and others) classes, which also makes it redundant.What is this adding to my routine, to my life? Nothing.Although the BMI AI test, as well as the tone, are very cool. But combined they make the entire profile only minimally worth the investment in time and money.Side note, There was a missed opportunity to make a very digital, minimalist watch (on the side). More added value to increase wear.",1
1272,"The Halo is very comfortable and nice looking, I also like that it is waterproof.  it mostly tracks great I think bur not sure on the sleep, a few nights it says it couldn't track and suggested it was placed wrong or I laid in a weird position that affected the tracking.  I like the points for activity and the quick heart monitor.  the body composite is also nice.  overall I love it and will know more about the sleep part as time goes on",4
1273,"Unintrusive. And that's quite an understatement.The lack of display solves the problem of being constantly tinkering with it and doesn't look as awkward as wearing two screens (smartwatch/smart bracelet) one in each arm.The 3D body modeling features concludes the same as my weight scale regarding body composition and right now seems to just give feedback on how my body changes. More useful would be recommending labs to target problem spots that can be derived from said model.Tone analysis blew my mind. That it was able to detect I was worried despite actively trying to deceive it.Looking forward to see  what else I can learn of myself with this tool.So far. Just because tone analysis, sleep patterns, activity tracking and the added value of labs. Good investment.Hope they expose some sort of api to play more with it.",5
1274,"Good start to the device. Looking forward to new software features. Such as an alarm that wakes you up in specific sleep cycles, more metrics like whe whoop device, and more partners to connect with.The workouts and suggested content is made largely made for normies, not athletes. Would be nice to see more ability to filter view to get more appropriate individual content. Not one size fits all.",4
1275,"I would rate this product a 4.5. So far I really like it. I recently had heart surgery and the heart rate was right on with what the hospital readings were. The one thing I noticed is you have to charge it more frequently than some other bands. The product itself is light, it's actually pretty comfortable. I haven't worn it in water yet...little scared too lol. As for the 4.5 and not 5, I believe there is always room for improvement with anything.",4
1276,"I've only had the Fitbit hr and was looking for a replacement what drew me to try this instead of getting another Fitbit was the body fat measuring scanner, I thought it would be a very useful feature, for someone trying to lose weight. Which in away it is but it's not enough, I miss being able to seeing what my heart rate is by simply checking my wrist having to look at my phone right after a work out is kinda annoying. However the band is more comfortable that my old Fitbit. The accuracy of sleep tracking, heart rate and an calorie tracking are bbn on par with the Fitbit. I dont I might still get another Fitbit use and use them both.",3
1277,"The halo activity tracker works beautifully. Fabulous functions, easy to use, great value.",5
1278,"I like the functionality of this tracker. It is extremely accurate regarding tone/voice recognition. That is the original reason I purchased- My family kept misinterpreting my tone when I spoke (thinking I was agitated and I wasn’t). This has worked wonders. The sleep tracking is super accurate but I’ve found the body scans and workouts to be the next most important thing for me. I like that the device is truly waterproof. We just spent a week at a water park/resort and my Halo still works perfectly. This is a great device for those already familiar with fitness trackers.My only complaint would be that there is no screen/way to tell the time. I replaced my FitBit with it initially, but now I wear one on each arm (a little awkward at first but it gets the job done. Lol).",5
1279,"I am returning this device. I really wanted to like it, but was disappointed every step of the way.Appearance: very flimsy bracelet. Looks like I wrapped some velcro tape around my wrist.Battery life: run out of juice on day 2.Usability: terrible. The Halo app has one of the most unintuitively designed interfaces I have ever seen. None of the features worked as I expected. For example, the sleep tracker shows ""sleep quality"" measure, which is pretty meaningless, but I could not easily get to the sleep duration. The app constantly invites you to listen to ""sleep sounds"" but I didn't find a way to adjust the duration of a track, or have it on a loop. Then there are exercise options, provided by different exercise companies that are neither integrated with each other nor with the core functionality of the Halo. You don't get recommendations on which exercises you should be doing, or customize/schedule the programs. And so on.Privacy and security: Uncertain. Tone of voice analysis seems not all that secure, and why do I need this feature anyway?Finally: there is no display. For some reason Amazon developers decided we cannot manage the distractions of having a small screen that would show just one or two items, let's say clock and distance walked. If I'm wearing something on my wrist, it better tell me the time. If I have to get my phone to check time or some basic stats - this device is not adding value to my life.Bottom line: this is not a market-ready product. I'm staying with Fitbit.",1
1280,Does what needed for.  Accurate.  Offers lots features,4
1281,"I had high hopes for this and was excited when I got the notification that I could order it last year. The part I was most excited about was the sleep tracking. I have sleep problems and have not been able to get very accurate readings from any other device, but this one sounded promising. Unfortunately it was unable to track my sleep data. I made sure all settings were correct by following what customer service told me to do. There was no change.The voice recognition is really cool. It was fun to look at how my emotions were when communicating throughout the day. And it was a bit eye opening as to how I let my emotions run me sometimes.The battery life was good at first but quickly started to decreased after a few weeks.I'm honestly quite disappointed in the product and I would not recommend it to anyone. I think it needs some revamping or it needs to be scrubbed. The amount of money spent for a less than mediocre product wasn't worth it for me.",2
1282,"I was really excited to get the halo but I'm not really impressed. Some things that I think would be great additions would be the ability to smart cast the fitness videos to your TV. Also, great if Halo could integrate a fasting tracker, and hydration reminders. As well as some type of nudge to move.  Still not sure I will keep this product after having it for 3 weeks. Currently using fastic app to track fasting times and for hydration reminders. Also exercising via you tube videos that I watch from my TV. Because of the current design of the halo I am essentially using it to track steps and sleep so I'm not convinced that it's worth keeping.",3
1283,"I have been wearing the halo daily for a little over 2 months now. There has been a significant increase in sync time as well as lagging on the app. The HR tracking is generally accurate, but today it told me my HR was in the 30s during exercise which is hard to believe. The sleep feature is also hit or miss and does not accurately discriminate between laying in bed on my phone and sleeping. I do like this product, but there is definitely room for improvement.",4
1284,I love all the things you can try. I listen to ASMR sounds  every morning before work and Binaural Beats every night to fall asleep. I am glad it is just a band without anything to distract me.,5
1285,It is not the prettiest thing I could wear on my wrist. I also take it off before doing dishes or anything that requires my hands getting wet since that standard band takes a while to dry.,5
1286,"First, this band is lighter than the Samsung watch. It has some similarities to Samsung health. They both track your sleep. But the band is much lighter, which gives you the comfort of sleeping at night. The body scan feature is great! Nobody has come up with that idea yet. Once you have scanned your body, you can look at what kind of difference your body will change if you choose to start dieting over time. The Halo also features tone recognition with the mic. It is very accurate by showing what kind of mood you may be in at the time. Amazon did try to make things more rewarding by adding ""labs"" which is just exercises or activities that are also featured on the Samsung watch. I do wish that the Halo had added recipes or food options as apart of the programs they feature in the app",5
1287,"Does it have a screen? No but that's why I bought it. I didn't want any other distractions.  As far as the sleep tracker, it's not accurate at all.  I have some really bad nights and as long as I'm lying down it gives me a great score.  The app isn't that helpful. Sure it tracks my steps and heart rate, but that's all that's great. I hope amazon updates it with better labs because the ones available suck.  Tried tone for a bit but It picks up any voice that's talking.  Meal, measurement  and menstrual tracking would be nice if added. Halo is far too basic for me and I like simple things.",3
1288,,5
1289,"I find that the Halo band is very inaccurate.  I have been using 4 different tracking devices: Apple watch,  iphone, a high end pedometer and a halo band.  Today, the watch, phone, and pedometer registered around 7000 steps, the Halo band registered 5000 steps.  This is not the first time this has happened.  My normal resting heart rate is 50, the halo band often measures my resting heart rate  at 90-100.  I am a physician and I know how to take a pulse, when the halo says my pulse is 90,  I take my pulse digitally and with a pulse oximeter - it is 50.",3
1290,"I really wanted to love this band, but I will be returning it.  The tracker itself contains nickel, which is causing burns on my skin. I’ve tried several barrier method but the result is the same after 2-3 days of wear.Also, I used the restroom 4 times last night and it states I only had one sleep disturbance, I know I wasn’t sleep walking so I doubt the accuracy.I do like the points, the body scan and all of the videos.  I never used the tone.If they make a nickel free tracker, I will consider purchasing again.I do own an Apple Watch and do not experience anywhere near the irritation that this tracker causes.",3
1291,"This is a review only for the activity and sleep tracking I do not use the tone or fat tracker. I love that the design is simple and it doesn't have a screen. It tracks my sleep accurately even if I get up for an hour and go back to sleep. It also tracks my jogging very accurately. My problem is when I'm weight lifting. I don't know if it's the way my wrist can bunch up and cause too much tension against the screen, but at many points it will just stop accurately reading. I will have to stop what I'm doing, take the band off, move it around, and stand still while it figures itself out every time I lift. (I use another means of heart rate tracking to see if I'm just losing my mind or if it's really telling me my heart rate is only 110) I will play around with it and see if I can get it to stay accurate, but I spend 4 hours a week lifting so it's really a pain.",2
1292,"I was looking for something that wouldn’t  constantly distract me (like my Smart Watch) with alerts from my phone (texts/calls/apps/etc)Overall, I am very happy with my Halo!The Halo is:-Comfortable and lightweight (I sleep with it on and I don’t notice it at ALL!)-I love that is tracks the quality of my exercise (not just steps taken)-The sleep tracker is also a useful tool-I didn’t realize how little sleep I was getting!-I have not been swimming with it on yet, but I love that it is waterproof and CAN swim with it:)If I could change anything about it:-I wish it also doubled as an old school watch (just to tell the time)- I ordered with a lighter colored band (light silver/gray?) and it shows stains...gross. Now I have to purchase another in a darker color-for $30",5
1293,"Water Proof seal on bottom broke, ordered may 3 and warranty ended Nov 4, only 6 month is really lame.  Makes me wonder if they are just poorly built to begin with to not push at least a year warranty.  Other then that it was great, would be nice if it had more sensors like O2 but the app is really great giving you free courses/classes to sign up too for better eating, sleeping, fitness etc.",3
1294,"I’ve had a Whoop band for almost a year and I’m ditching it (rather not drop $30/mo but the info-app are great). The Halo Band had been decent, I’m wearing in conjunction with my Whoop for another month to see how data aligns but I can’t complain for something that has been released not very long ago. That app itself definitely needs improvement and some tweaks added to it, but I would guess in time that’ll happen. Also once the monthly billing starts $4, much more cost effective.",4
1295,"Great idea and incorporation of body fat using imagery, providing a motivating image of what I'd look like with various BMIs. I also like the analysis it does with my sleep and find it's a little better than my Apple Watch or previous FitBit. The app does a good job with suggesting various add-on features, reminders, or programs to keep me healthy. I'm not sure the tonality analysis is that great as it gives me small (seconds) time-window indication of how I sounded hours before, when I don't even remember what I was doing or what I said. Not sure if that is intended or not but it's an overall unique insight I never before had. I do forget that I'm wearing it and would like to have a longer battery life though, but that can be said with any wearable nowadays.",5
1296,"It worked well.  Very comfortable.  One thing that grinds my gears is if I worked out yesterday, I have to remember what time I went to the gym.Can there be a guess like ""hey did you work out?"" As well as a 24 hour look at what your heart rate is at what time?I feel like if I forget what when it's over.",4
1297,"I didn't want a device that would distract and do a 100 other things I just wanted it to track me. The problem is when I'm sleeping I always have THAT arm that I have the band on under me and it makes causes problems when I try to slide that arm in and out from under me. Other than that I love my Halo - is it accurate, I don't know, I don't have a secondary device monitoring to tell me otherwise.",4
1298,"I really like the data and analytics. However it's charger is horrible, one band was not charging at all, then the tracker fell off from the band, I was just wearing band whole day. I ordered another one same story, charging is challenging, I liked the data feed and tone analyzer. So I do see the value there.",3
1299,"I purchased this fitness tracker because it was at a lower price point. The tracker seem to work great, at first. But here we are less than a week later and it is not working and all of my data is gone. Now the tracker will not sync with my phone any longer. PROS: lower price point, comfortable bandCONS: clunky app. Monthly fee.fabric band. While it is very comfortable to wear, within days the band began to get a lot of little lint  balls on them. I can't imagine what it would look like if I had it for a month.No face you're tied to your phone with this device. This is okay but I never knew my steps or sleeping patterns etc unless I opened up my phone.Overall I would give this a pass. I'll be returning this device.",1
1300,"I returned it to Amazon today after trying it for about 3+ weeks.  First, the sleep tracking was not accurate.  There were times I was awake and the tracker had me sleeping and visa versa.  And, my wife pretty much confirmed my reaction.  Second, using Tone as a voice tracker really did a number on battery strength.  Plus, charging the battery was more tricky than it should have been.  Third, the Halo instructions could have been clearer in several places.  Fourth, I was not fat but lost about 25 pounds during the Covid lockdown.  I tried the body scan twice and both times got results that suggested I needed to lose much more weight.  I recently read a Halo review by a man who was super thin and got the same result I did.  Lastly, I found wearing the Halo to bed uncomfortable as a side sleeper.  All too often, I would turn in some direction and find the mechanism of the band digging into part of me that was uncomfortable.There are lots of room for improvement.",2
1301,"I thought I would be ok with not having a screen, but I missed being able to easily see the time and quick access to step count / activity time. I also would like reminders to get up and move during the day as well as better evaluation of my activity / sleep - what should I be doing differently, for example. I tried some of the labs and I wasn’t impressed - no sound so you’re trying to follow along with a workout video but it won’t tell you when to change exercises and you’re trying to see the small phone screen while moving. Wasn’t helpful. The band got dingy quickly. I’m looking for a new exercise tracker already.",3
1302,"The activity tracking simply isn’t accurate, unfortunately. I’ve reset it, made sure I was wearing it the right way, and still it’s not accurate. I can work out and the heart monitor shows my heart is beating at moderate to high levels but the app says my workout is light to maybe moderate. It’s disappointing not to receive credit for the effort when I’m trying to track it only through this device.The sleep tracker is good and the body scanner feels quite accurate.Overall, it’s a great way to track your fitness and activity but just know you may have to manually add activities to give yourself proper credits for workouts.",3
1303,"I really would have kept this Halo if the charge would just last. Unfortunately, in order to ensure that the halo worked at night, I had to charge it (sometimes) more than once a day. I liked that it kept track of my sleep, steps and moods. One thing I miss that I had on my Fitbit was a clock. The charger makes it difficult to charge since it doesn't have a ""mated"" hookup. Have to wiggle it into place to work and I suspect that the charger was going when I submitted the return. At least Amazon is accepting the return. Bummer. Have to start a new search. This was supposed to be ""it"".",3
1304,"This was a lot of fun for a couple months until it stopped recording data.  I called the helpline, they couldn’t figure out what to do after all the reset trouble shooting options didn’t fix it.  They said they were passing it on to “engineering” for further review and that I d hear from someone in 2 business days.No one ever called, so a week or so later, I had to call back.  They still hadn’t figured out what it was, so they made me do all of the same troubleshooting stuff, which still didn’t work.  I basically had to beg to be sent a replacement.So they sent me a refurbished one that, even after deleting the app, factory resetting the thing several times, and starting a prayer circle, would not sync with my phone.It was fun and really nice while it lasted (about 3 months), but it is not worth the hassle or my time to try with another one, so I am sending it back.  The whole thing is garbage, and the support is basically “turn it off and back on again” 11 times and then pretend you don’t exist when that doesn’t work.  Don’t waste your money/time.",1
1305,"I bought this for the body fat scanning feature. It was incredible that Amazon said I could get body fat scans at the same accuracy as a Dexa scan for only a few bucks a month. Unfortunately, the accuracy of these scans was completely off. Over the course of four months I lost 30 pounds with the help of a nutritionist. By the end I even had visible abs. But Halo’s assessment said I was 21% body fat, which would be impossible. In fact, despite losing 30 pounds of fat, Halo said my body fat had only dropped by 1 percentage point in 16 weeks. I found this very demotivating at times — and I was a little  worried that if someone else were using this product it might give them severe body dysmorphia or even anorexia! In short, the body fat measurements are complete garbage.The activity monitor is... a hassle. You have to enter in every detail of your workout for it to track — something other trackers don’t need. Even worse, you may do exactly the same workout every day and get wildly different readings every time. It definitely didn’t give me any confidence in its accuracy.The sleep tracker was so annoying. It constantly said I didn’t sleep more than a few hours a night. If Halo were accurate about my sleep stats, I’d be having sleep deprivation hallucinations right now.The Tone feature was pretty cool and surprisingly accurate. Of course, the one feature that works well ends up having next-to-no real world utility for me.",1
1306,"I Love my Halo, but it lasted less than 6 months.  Amazon customer service was very helpful, and after checking on the problem they decided it was a hardware issue.  Because I enjoy my Halo, I agreed to a ""certified"" refurbished device as a replacement, however, considering the length of time I have had the Halo, I believe replacement with a brand new device is the better solution.",4
1307,"I used this primarily for tracking my sleep, but it is nice to also track my activity.  I have had insomnia for years and this showed me how often small things disturbed my sleep.  I made some adjustments to my sleep habits and am sleeping much better.  Unfortunately, the free trial of my mobile app expired, and now the Halo has become very basic unless you pay the monthly fee.  Disappointing.I feel like going back to my Garmin watch because there is no monthly fee to use the extended features on it.",3
1308,"I love that the Halo can track your sleep pattern because I really don't get much sleep at night. It let's you know if you're in a deep sleep and even dream mode sleep.  Which was really amazing to me.  I be dreaming every night.The mobile app is great, you can monitor your tracking live.It's still a work in progress for me because I'm learning how to use it fully.One thing for me is I wish it could monitor your blood pressure.",4
1309,"Firat thing every Halo user should do is mute mic, and not for any security reason its a huge battery drain.  In one 24 hour period the battery drops 45% with it off 7%. Thats a a huge difference i also found the ""tone"" feature to be kinda useless or pointless. Outside of that im liking it!  Oh charger needs to be better i seem to ha e to fiddle to make sure its charging which again is a reason i hate the mic",4
1310,"My Fitbit does the same thing and shows me the time on my wrist rather than nothing. The sleep tracker worked fine when the battery was charged. Most often the battery would die during the night, so no sleep tracking. Speaking of the battery, rarely made it 24 hours without having to charge, and charging took longer than ""taking a shower"" as they suggest when to charge it. Body composition, a joke. I lost 10 lbs in between scans and it said my body composition was more than it was before. Seriously? The tone of voice monitor was sporadic at best. On my birthday, when I was laughing and in a good mood the entire day, it said I was either neutral or reserved.  As for the activity tracker, it is similar to the Fitbit in that when you are walking around grocery shopping it does not track your steps because your arms are on the cart, not moving back and forth. Seems like there could be an attachment you could put in your pocket or on your ankle to track those steps. Returning before I start getting charged the monthly membership.",2
1311,"Sleep tracking was great but Halo wouldn't track it about 2-3 times per month due to the position of the band and my wrist.If you're a side sleeper and you sleep with your Halo-hand underneath your pillow, the band will eventually get bothersome b/c the band doesn't curve to your wrist, so it's annoying sometimes....almost to the point that it hurts the wrist.Battery died one day earlier this month, and I just decided not to charge it.  I haven't missed it since.If they make it curved to conform to the wrist, I would consider using it again.",3
1312,"I liked this a lot but I have some carpal tunnel issues and at times it hurts my wrist and I am not able to wear it for a few days. If I didn't have the issue with my wrist and where the band sat at it would probably have worked for me. The band is soft, I love the silver color, the sleep tracker gave me great insight, and used the app to get my grandson to sleep at night with a story.",4
1313,"I purchased this for my use, to help track my overall wellness. This feels like a development prototype, not an end-user product to me. The idea is great, the features, capabilities, the app...but the band itself is a huge miss. With so many other wellness devices and smartwatches out there, I'm disappointed that this clunky, unattractive band is the best Amazon could come up with.The good:The app is easy to useLove the body scanThe sleep quality tracking is greatThe exercise, meditation, and diet features are convenient and helpful.The cons:The band is unattractive/cheap looking (the 'silver' is a light gray/blue )It is uncomfortable and bulkyAs a nurse, I have to wear a watch in addition to the band because there is no clockThe activity tracking is very inaccurate (I earned activity points today while the item was sitting on my dresser)Can not be paired with other tracking systems I simply couldn't justify keeping the Halo at this time.My hope is that one day, I will be able to pay for the halo membership and use it with a smartwatch.",2
1314,"Had it under a week so I’ll update as I go .... but so far: easy to set up, accurate against my Apple Watch, and great tool! Fits well, love it has no screen to distract me. The app is where you go to see how  you are doing. It’s not at all bothersome, not even to sleep in! I know it’s a first go for amazon at this, so I’m sure it’ll only improve where glitches may occur ... but I’ve had no issues!!",4
1315,"I understand the purpose of this device and appreciate that it communicates with the app. I have two issues, first the battery life does not last 24 hours, so I'm having to charge it daily. Second, the voice analysis picks up dialect or tone that is not at all descriptive of my communication tone or mood. I am a woman with a deeper voice, so it's always making implications that I am annoyed, angry or upset when I am not at all.",4
1316,"So far I am enjoying the Halo a lot. It has a far more indepth awareness of my movement than other fitness/sleep trackers and has made me far more aware of my movement.I am starting to get a little bit of a red spot where it constantly makes contact which has never happened with other similar devices, but my skin is a bit sensitive. Regardless, I docked one star for that, as well as it is a touch uncomfortable from time to time.",4
1317,I've been using my Amazon Halo for a couple of month and I really like it! Excellent at tracking though occasionally misses sleep. (Like twice in 3 months.) Water proof so I take it swimming and boating.,5
1318,"One of the features of Halo is the many programs offered.  However, the filter options are not specific enough to find what you are looking for in a program.  It would be helpful to have a a search option and the capability to bookmark a program without having to spend a ridiculous amount of time finding it again if you have not set a ""reminder"" every day, which I often don't want.  I do not use the Tone feature as it really doesn't assess my voice accurately.  I hope the reviews are taken into consideration, since this is a new gadget, and feedback should be important.",3
1319,"I had the Halo for three weeks. I really did like it. But it doesn’t sit tight in the band. So you guessed it. It popped out and there is no way to locate it. The only thing you can do is spend the money to get another.Since this review Amazon actually called me, which shocked me completely, and we spoke at length. A defective band was discovered a replacement Halo is on its way! Truly do like this device. If you are looking to track your overall health the app is easy to use and keeps you mindful of the changes you’re making and the progress occurring. Thank you Amazon. My faith has been restored and Halo is the best tracker I’ve used.",5
1320,Definitely not the best.  The features seem to need to be redone like the tone analysis u need to redo the voice feature so u have to respect so it may analysis ur voice.  The charger is awful just awful.  U have to fidget with it to charge.  Subpar at best,2
1321,Very good product for tracking goals using a data driven approach. I got this product on sale during prime day and it was well worth the $45 I spent.,5
1322,Love the band but the only problem I have came across is that after a week of wearing it the button came off. So now to reconnect I have to grab something small to place where the button used to be and double tap it that way. Other then that its great for the price.,4
1323,"Honestly, I bought this mostly for the body fat estimate function, and that was the only thing that’s been somewhat useful. It way overestimates calorie expenditure, I know my maintenance calories and this thing throws out a number roughly 35% higher, I’d get fat fast  if I listened to this thing. Sleep tracker is also way off, if you wake up in the middle of the night for more than ten minutes just know the rest of your sleep is going to count to your 8 sedentary hours for the day. The point system sounds great in theory but as a full time student, it feels like I’m getting punished for doing homework and going to class. Even working full time as a waitress, and lifting 5 days a week isn’t enough to offset my course load. Furthermore, the heart rate tracker might be accurate but it’s hard to know when you can only view your daily max and resting but nothing in between. I’ve been wearing this thing for over three months and honestly don’t it was worth half what I paid.",2
1324,"The halo is great. I didn't have a fitness tracker before, this is my first one. I have enjoyed using it. It has access to a ton of great apps. I also love the voice tone feature. I guess I sound depressed and sad when I speak! It has provided some great insights! I do wish I didn't get the pink band, it picks up everything and is very difficult to clean. Overall, I am happy! I just wish it had better battery life.",4
1325,"I like the Amazon Halo.  It looks good, it's mostly comfortable (if you can zero in on just the right band tightness to keep it against your wrist without hurting), and the data is pretty good and presented well.  I appreciate that it does a good job of automatically recognizing and logging my jogs.However - at the end of the day - it's just not worth it.  Amazon will disable an excessively wide slate of basic features (including the daily sleep score and activity score) unless you start paying them $3.99/month 6 months after purchase.  If you do not pay this monthly fee, the data you receive is reduced to roughly what you might expect from a $20 step tracker purchased on AliExpress (steps, heart rate and estimated calories).I'd be willing to pay if the Halo provided data that was exceptionally better than competitor devices that lack monthly fees.  This is not the case, so far as I can tell.  I plan to switch to a Fitbit at the end of my free trial.",2
1326,"I really wanted to love this and the first couple of weeks it was great but, and there's always a but, right.  I have had to delete the Halo App twice to get it to work.  The first time I was on the phone with tech help and it took about 20 minutes before he decided that I should just delete the app and start again.  It's worked both times I've had to do it but it's a pain and usually I lose that day's data.  I'm really sorry I bought this because I'm sure they will come up with an updated one.",3
1327,"Its pretty cool, I havent used any of the programs yet so personally I dont care for all that ""demotivating"" stuff. It's a good piece of technology and it works well, my only complaint is sometimes the band is itchy. I just hope amazon makes a halo ring, not like the amazon loop but like the halo. It would be dope and more comfortable.",4
1328,"I received early access to this item before it actually went on sale, so I’ve been wearing it for almost two months. The only thing this product actually gages is your steps. The labs are neat but don’t let you tell the app when you’re doing the workouts, and won’t pick up on it either. My best example of its inaccuracy happened yesterday afternoon. I went on a very intense bike ride, rode about 20 miles in an hour and a half through the hills of Tennessee and the halo did not even consider this a “moderate” workout because my heart rate didn’t go over 96 BPM. Which is insane because I checked my heart rate during the ride and it was 140+ (halo considers 136+ an intense workout) but wait there’s more... after relaxing a bit, I went to take a shower. I was just standing there waiting on it to heat up, halo was registering my heart rate as 137 BPM.... “intense”..Aside from all of that, the tone app is also incredibly inaccurate even on its highest setting, which will drain your battery in a day.. I tried the BMI, it’s neat but because the inaccuracies of other features I don’t really trust it.. I’m overall extremely disappointed with the Halo, was really excited about it. But I’d be better off just going back to a free step counter (pedometer) app, since that’s about all the halo does for me. I hate to leave such a scathing review, because I love Amazon products but this one really didn’t live up to the standard.",1
1329,"I just ordered a replacement as my first one stopped working after 2 weeks. The battery died, I charged it and now it won’t turn back on. I am hoping that it was just a bad one and my replacement will be fine, because it is definitely my favorite tracker I’ve ever used. It’s so nice to have something quiet on my wrist that isn’t constantly vibrating and no distracting screen. I’ve used an Apple Watch, FitBit and Garmin in the past and got so irritated by the constant notifications that I felt like I couldn’t escape. This is exactly what I need…. If it works for more than 2 weeks",2
1330,"I've used a variety of different gadgets to monitor health data and the Halo has been the best for my needs. I use Strava to track cardio, Samsung Health for nutrition, and now Halo for sleep tracking and overall activity.The app is very easy to use and intuitive with pertinent information contained within. The Halo itself is comfortable to wear for long periods of time and the battery life is eternal.I've only used the body scan a few times but it seems accurate and is easy to follow. The voice tracking option is interesting but the few times I used it, I couldn't remember who I was talking to and what about that caused me to have a specific tone in my voice. I'm sure if I checked the app more frequently throughout the day it would have proven more useful.",5
1331,"It took me a while to get used to the Halo fitness tracker not having a digital display. However, I have come to appreciate the design. Yet, for the longest time, I didn't use the tracker because the battery life is so short-lived it somewhat renders the purpose of tracking your data powerless and inconsistent for those who are active and on the go. This is not a tracker of convenience if your lifestyle is busy and on the go because it dies so quickly you can't keep track of data accurately.The customer support is poorly executed. Seems to be pre-written same responses for different problems, with no human touch at all..same instruction "" unpair then re-pair the Bluetooth.."" over and over... lol.. yeah ok, Amazon!  I expected more of Amazon yet, I can appreciate their attempt to compete in this space and try new things which makes me appreciate my main fitness trackers all the more. Great concept, poorly executed.",2
1332,All in all I'm happy to say I like the halo. Though when I bicycle the amount of points its giving me has been inconsistent even though I ride the same route and distance every day. The voice recognition has been helpful in adjusting my tone when conversing with others. The videos are cool too with a wide assortment of training for every level. I would recommend the halo to anyone interested in having a personal assistant 24/7.,4
1333,"I love all features of this product. It really motivated me to do more exercise and sleep earlier.I returned it because of skin allergies. I tried different positions, different hands, loosen the belt. I wear watches and other bands but never had skin allergy issues.I'm not alone. Many other customers reported the skin allergy problem in their review pictures",4
1334,Parece  practico,4
1335,Since wearing the halo band I have tracked my sleeping with great results. I’ve also kept track of my daily steps. The ease and convenience of this tool is greatly appreciate.,5
1336,"I do like the accuracy, and the sleep tracking. Had a few fitbits over the years, and appreciate the tracking ability of this. However, if you are not in range of wifi, the app barely works, so you can't see anything, this is big deal for me, so if you are planning on being out of range of service, this is a poor choice. I have a love hate relationship with the fabric band. It can be washed, but it does get dirty, and I can't just wipe it down and put it back on, as it takes a bit to dry. It does breathe better than the plastic/rubber band of most other activity trackers.",3
1337,"This is not a watch so don't purchase it if that is what you are wanting.  I actually wear my smart watch on one wrist and my Halo Band on the other.  The steps are always within a few hundred steps of each other.  I know my watch captures things other than actual steps and records them as steps so I feel that the Halo is more accurate at capturing true steps (I usually have less on my Halo).  It also provides more data for my sleep tracking which I love.  I have enjoyed the features in the mobile app as well. There are great videos for fitness, relaxation and more.  If anything happens to this one, I will absolutely replace it.",5
1338,"was excited at first - when it was working.. i liked the features, but after about a year... it would from time to time stop syncing - complete pain to get it sync again - double tap band would not work -",3
1339,"My 2nd Halo, purchased last September 2021, has now done what the first one did.  It will not charge within a reasonable amount of time. This morning it was at 33%, and it still has not completed charging  6 hours later. Halo number one lasted four months before having the same problem, and number two has lasted seven months, so that is an improvement. However, I wonder if the mechanism isn't really made to last.  I do like this as a tool - for awhile I used it along with WW to track activity.  And I've also used the sleep tracker to provide an overview of my sleep patterns and problems. With Halo number one, I attempted to get assistance multiple times from the Amazon Help group, but their advice was useless.  This time, I'm not at all optimistic of getting anything useful. This is too bad - this is a good concept and interface, but it breaks down too quickly!",2
1340,"I really like this device, I just wish it was compatible with more apps for tracking steps. The battery needs some work, at first it lasted about a week, now after a few months, it only lasts a couple days. Using the tone detection drains the battery very quickly, so I've ultimately shut it off in order to preserve the battery. Otherwise, its comfortable and works well at tracking steps and sleep.",4
1341,"I've owned several sleep and fitness trackers and this is my favorite so far. There's no screen to break, and it tracks everything I need it to. I LOVE the tone monitor because it's helping me learn how to communicate better with the people around me.UPDATE 08/21: I've had quite a few problems the last few months with Halo not recording my sleep, disconnecting from my phone and I don't know it until later, and it doesn't record my tone during the time I have it set to do so.",3
1342,Great tracker!  Really helps you figure out how you are moving. Breaks out intense from moderate from easy  and even subtracts if you sit too long. I love it!!,5
1343,"I'm not sure how useful this band is. The step counter is great. The sleep tracking is wildly off. I'm not sure how useful the tone tracking is, especially since it doesn't tell you what you said that triggered a reading or allow you to help it learn by overriding the evaluation. I have no clue what use the body scan is for. Really, this device seems a lot closer to the Fire Phone than anything else: cool ""what if"" features that people haven't asked for and don't need.I don't think I'll renew the membership after the 6-month trial is over.",3
1344,"I am disappointed . The pic looks as though it has somewhat of a sparkle to it , it does not. The sleep activity is incorrect. During the setup of the movement tracking ability the app just stops so I was never able to enjoy that feature.",3
1345,"A great monitor for sleep and mood as well as activity for the price  Bluetooth things. It became unpaired. After a couple tries, having Amazon customer support call me to help scared it into pairing.",4
1346,"I think the Halo is better than the Fitbit and cheap non-recognizable brand fit watches. The only issue is battery life when you leave the tone recognition feature. But when you turn off tone, the band will run for a week without needing a recharge. I like the sleep measurement feature and heart-rate features. I want to drill down more into the heart-rate data in the app, but maybe that is coming. The one missing feature is an Oximeter.",5
1347,"Look, this is a gen 1 device, but I hand it to Amazon for coming up with something inventive. Sure it tracks steps and HR like all of them do, but the power is in the application and membership, which seems to be getting better weekly. The body scan is an incredible feature and really motivates you to keep on track with goals. The fitness labs help give you tangible actions to help achieve your wellness goals, whether it be better sleep, loose weight, or manage stress. For those that do not like it...they have not used all the features or realize the potential of future features. Do I think the ""tone"" feature is far from perfect, absolutely, but A+ for coming up with something new. Take a look at Whoop who charges $18-30 a month for their membership vs the $7 this is.",5
1348,"I got one for free along with a 6 month subscription from work, but will give it away.- Inaccurate: my daily walk route doesn't change, but step count is between 4,600 and 7,200 on the band.- useless: I woke up for an hour in middle of the night and got a score of 70 and ""good"". No, not good.- No screen, I get it, but how about just a watch like the no screen echo dot?- Not uploading pics in underwear. Someone is going to look at those when they try to improve their machine learning.- Idiotic suggestions: ""go to sleep earlier"" really? How didn't I think of that myself?- Battery guzzling: if you turn on tone detection it won't last 2 days.- A little ""racist"": Seems like speaking in another language is being angry. Scared of foreigners? HahahaFor the good:- looks nice- waterproof (well, shower proof at least)- can be a heart rate meter- my cats like chasing it if I throw it on the bed.",2
1349,"I like that it doesn’t have a screen.I like the body fat tracking. I tend to think it’s reasonably accurate, it measures close to my bodyfat scale.I think the sleep tracking is reasonably accurate.I haven’t used Tone yet, but I will someday. I’m more interested in preserving the battery.I DON’T like the activity tracking which dramatically underrecords my workout intensity. I swear I could run a marathon and the Halo would credit me for a “light” workout. It thinks my walks are of moderate intensity, but my HIIT workouts are “light.”  I’ve reported this issue continuously to the Facebook test group and tech support, with no response.",3
1350,,5
1351,"Sleep tracking is consistently inaccurate and very accurate at the same time. It nails when I fall asleep and seems pretty in tune with my REM sleep however, it often tells me I’m in a light sleep when I’m wide awake. The heart rate monitoring isn’t up to par with other wearables. This should be a simple task. It doesn’t seem to track HR well while lifting weights. Works during sprinting and sled work. This thing needs a serious tune up if it wants to compete in this space. I got it to track HRV and monitor sleep quality. It’s not great at either. Hopefully they can get the kinks worked out.",3
1352,"The battery doesn't last nearly as long as it says, even without the voice feature, and it takes a while to charge.The band got gross within a few days - it wreaked! I switched to one of the activity bands, and I had the same issue, plus an allergic reaction, and I do not have sensitive skin.The sleep tracker misses a night a couple times a month, and doesn't pick up on long naps.I know no trackers are entirely accurate, but I have noticed here and there, it will go for hours without picking up any steps.",3
1353,"Pros: the size and weight of the Halo are great. Most comfortable fitness band I have slept in.Battery life is also great, if you don't use the speech feature (which I don't and only tried once).Cons: I am not convinced of it's sleep tracking accuracy. It will often say my sleep was not great, but I physically feel like I had a great night of sleep.I was fully aware that it would not have a screen when I bought the Halo. I did not use all the smart features on my previous fitness band, so I thought it would be fine. But after a few months of use, I want my screen back! All I wish it would do is show me the time and my step count. Having to find a clock to get the time or opening the app to get my step count is very distracting.I also miss the vibration reminders to move more that my previous fitness band had.I am looking forward to getting a new fitness tracker to replace my Halo.",2
1354,"I have owned this tracker since early in the product launch and it used to be perfect. I didn’t use the voice recognition or body composition features at all and the quick charging was really convenient. Now it’s been 11 months, and as I’m typing this review my halo band has been on a charger for 3 hours, and it’s still not done. For such a simplistic design I expected the charging feature to last longer.",3
1355,"I only rated this 4 stars at the moment because it’s a gift for my husband (who did receive it early). So far he’s 50/50 of it. He’s thrown off from not having a screen but says it’s “pretty cool with all the features!” It’s more accurate than the Fitbit we had, and it even includes workout and receive ideas within the app. If you’re more of the minimalist type like us, I would suggest it!Will update review as time passes.",4
1356,"I have a whoop and i will have to give credit where credit is due. Amazon designed an incredible band! The band stands activities and sleep better than anything out on the market. Not only that, it's extremely comfortable. The app is also very user friendly and pretty. However, that's where the praise ends.I do have a Whoop and even though i have issues with their awful band design. It allows me to track Heart Rate Variability, Respiratory Rate (Which can even predict if you have covid or other respiratory illnesses), It tracks naps you take or exercises you did so you get a break down for every type of activity.I was hoping for the halo to offer more than just ....step counting and heart rate... I really wanted to like it but it's just not fuctional for athletes. I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu so I can't wear it while grappling either. All in all. Their focus was on pleasing housewives and office workers that do the occasional workouts, but not meant for atheletes that want to have many tools for recovery available.",2
1357,"I needed a replacement for my Misfit Ray and was looking for an activity tracker that wasn’t a watch (I prefer to wear a classic watch) and the Halo is proving to be a good fit for me (literally and figuratively). Some of the key features that are valuable for me, the long battery life (4 days on average) waterproof (I wear it 24/7 including showering and swimming) quick charge time (so it’s not off my wrist for very long) biometrics such as pulse and body temperature tracking (provides greater insight into my workouts and sleep patterns) and in general the ease of use for the App.  For those seeking a fairly unobtrusive activity tracker, that doesn’t have a visible display, I’d highly recommend the Halo 👍.",5
1358,"I lost my Father recently and I got this as a tool to monitor my grieving. I know, weird but it works.I am able to track my sleep and tone which are currently my concern areas. Especially in professional settings where I want to remain focused. The sleep tracker allows me to understand how my recent loss is affecting my sleep. I came to stay with my Mom in support and I am able to see how my REM is affected.I love the Halo. I am ready to use it entirely— to monitor my body, activity as I go back to the gym and begin to get back to my new normal",5
1359,"I have no idea what happened to my skin. Even just a tiny slit for the time would have been great since it's taking room on my wrist. It does not reload the sink feature well. It does not track your naps like the fitbit. I don't really feel like the body scan is accurate. The voice feature is a nice feature if you wanted to drain your battery within a day. I was really hoping this product would be more because they advertised it pretty well to me. But it just fell short, there was a lot of work that needs to be done.",3
1360,"This thing is so far from accurate. Support doesn't believe it is anything but genius and no way it could be wrong. I used multiple other trackers and recorded simoltanious results for them to analyze showing this product 30+bpm under any other tracker. Also a video of me counting heart beats as this tracker is crazy off.I love everything about this device other than it's hr tracking. App is great, body fat scan is amazing, in app programming is quite good. It's just a terrible device to track actual workouts, which to me is quite important. I would highly recommend this for runners only (seems accurate for that). If you go to a gym this thing is close to pointless.I tried so hard to love this. I love all things amazon. Get a Whoop and save the issues. At least until this gets a new generation.Key points.1. I was early release.2. I contacted support 5+ times with no real answers.3. Pass on this if you go to a gym -at all.4. Love amazon.5. Very disappointed in Halo.",2
1361,"Was used to metrics from a Polar Ignite and H10 band and gave this a try to see what it brought to table. Sleep tracking was good. Found the Tone function rather gimmicky and quite frankly a battery drain. Ended up turning off.  Missed seeing a HR graph like i was used to.  The body scan was surprisingly accurate.  Had a BF% done a few days after the Halo had calculated based on info and pics. The Halo was much closer than I thought it would have been.Is it a performance tracker, no.  But it is definitely something someone looking to improve overall health and sleep habits could use.",3
1362,"I really wanted to like the Halo. I’ve been using fitbits for years but I was interested in something that didn’t have a screen as well as fascinated by the possibility of voice analysis. While the lattermost is interesting, it’s gimmicky at best and doesn’t reveal anything helpful or particularly applicable to how you’d use it in any viable way.As mentioned in the title, battery life is really abysmal. Even when optimizing voice and settings, you still have to charge this thing every day as opposed to about once per week with the Fitbit.Also the scoring mechanism is reasonably incompressible and rather than just giving steps it gives a “score” which isn’t easy to translate into anything meaningful.I could go on but the only thing this thing does that’s interesting that a Fitbit doesn’t is the voice analysis and body scan. Fitbit does all the rest quite well and I’m not sure if the hassle of charging every day vs every week is worth it.I will undoubtedly be canceling my halo membership as soon as it comes due unless Amazon somehow fixes the battery life.",2
1363,"I have been in an early access program and paid $64.99 plus tax (versus the current $94.99) for the device with six months of subscription included.I would call this a FAILED product attempt.To my surprise, I just found out I can still send it back. I'm going to do that TODAY and get my $59.99 plus tax back.This has no display so compared to my Fitbit Versa 2 it is much less useful on my arm.The sleep tracking is comparable to the Fitbit but with a much worse interface in the iPhone app.The tone-of-your-voice thing is really pointless because it grades your tone at various times but has no way for you to know what you were saying.The activity tracking is confusing and just seeing step counts is somewhat hidden.The heart rate seems to match my Versa 2.Over half the space in the iPhone app is come-ons for what they call ""labs"".On top of all that, it's a subscription service and I am not about to pay anything every month for this nonsense.I mentioned the battery life. It has to be recharged at least every other day. It actually goes about a day and a half but in practice, that means that at least half the time I have to remember to recharge it before I go to sleep. You do get an alert to do that and another one when it is charged.My Fitbit Versa 2 only needs charging about every 3-4 days.",1
1364,The band fit okay but it disconnected too often from the Bluetooth,4
1365,"I have compared this to two other devices as well as syncing device, counting my steps, and then syncing again. It is over estimating my steps by at least 10 percent by my count. The biggest flaw is in the sleep tracker. It does not record a nap and it doesn’t record a major sleep interruption and you falling back to sleep properly. Last night, my dog had to go outside at 2 a.m. and it never recorded me falling back to sleep....I did. Two nights ago, I had to get an ambulance for my mom in the middle of the night, took a nap the falling afternoon...again no recording of it.",3
1366,Okay so I really like the halo and gave it four stars just because it is pretty new and you can’t sync it to many other apps yet.I also don’t like that it doesn’t count your calories during the day so I have to manually figure out my calories based on my steps.Lastly I have an iPhone 6 and the halo must require a newer phone because the app keeps glitching and shutting down.,4
1367,I love the way my halo band syncs automatically with my WW app. I also love the sleep tracker AND the total calorie expenditure. I have used the workout segments and the recipe suggestions. I no longer rely on my Fitbit and depend entirely on my halo. I would be lost without it.,5
1368,I might have given it a 4 if I still had it.  Cheaper way to track activity and sleep and motivate you from sitting on your butt too long.  I gave it a 3 because it came dislodged from the band and I didn’t realize it and it’s lost.  I don’t expect amazon to do anything about it but I wouldnt buy another one when the device is that unstable from the band.,3
1369,"I am not a normal review person, but I had to write one for this product. Love the app and what it can do, hate the charger. Its like all the money is R&D was invested in the band, but the charger is crap. It takes me five minutes to get the clamp on correctly, even on correctly it takes another two minutes for it to register and show a red light (and no it wasnt completely dead I always charge on like ten percent). I would easily give this five stars if the charger was fixed.",3
1370,"I use the Halo to track my activity & sleep. I love that just wearing it seems to accurately track any activity that I partake in, whether it be intentional activity, such as walking or running, or normal activities, like house cleaning or yard work. I know there were a lot of complaints about wearing it & it bothering either the skin or being quite uncomfortable, but I don’t have problems with either. I don’t use much on the app, such as the fitness or meal suggestions, so I can’t give an honest opinion on those. Overall, this is a nice product if you want to be more conscious of your movement & sleep habits.",5
1371,"The mobile app is great. The sleep tracking works well. The accuracy of the tone meter is a little off. I went hours without talking (I wake up before the rest of my family) and the range of my tone was all over the place even though I never spoke. Also, they may want to make an extra-large band. Yahoo has an article stating that the battery lasts a week but the battery on mine only lasts 1 day.",4
1372,"I've been wearing the Halo every day since I received it. I got it as a new option as my Fitbit that I was  a huge fan of was old and needed to be replaced. The stats that the Halo tracks are very vague in nature; nothing re steps, miles, etc. The sleep feature is fine (just fine). You need to upload photos to track some of the body stuff, which frankly is odd to me and nothing I needed to do for Fitbit. The price point is good relative to others, but bad when again,  this is basically a glorified wristband. I regret purchasing and will go back to either Fitbit or get an Apple Watch (despite the lift in price). ** question above about voice recognition; mine doesn't have that feature",5
1373,"This tracker is ok and overall seems to work pretty well. That is until my wife's died after only 9 months of use. And since Amazon only appears to only offer 6 months of product support, it's not a product I would suggest if you would like the manufacturer to stand behind their product for a reasonable period of time. Also, the charger is garbage and does not easily connect to the band. Overall, 3 stars is generous given the manufacturer support and the charger issue.",3
1374,"I had high hopes for the Amazon Halo.  However, I had issues with it syncing to my smartphone.  Found out from the support technician that my Bluetooth was out-of-date.  I planned to order a new phone with Bluetooth 5.0 so the Halo and other items would sync without a problem.  I also planned to order several replacement bands.  When I checked on items in my cart, I saw that the price for the Halo replacement bands had significantly increased.  I then decided that the Halo was becoming too expensive and I would stick with Fitbit.  So back it goes.  Oh...I did purchase a new phone.",3
1375,Good device I gave it as a gift and I D K how it's handling THK U,4
1376,"Sleep tracking is way off, it's saying I'm getting 3 hours of sleep, then the other 4 hours that I'm actually sleeping is counting as sedentary time.  I use a cpap that measures my sleep so I know for a fact this is off by a lot.That said,  it is comfortable,  easy to use,  and I still usually get past 150 points in most weeks even with the sleep being counted as sedentary time. I like it fine and will continue to use it because I have it.",3
1377,"Likes: unobtrusiveness, comfort, good app - especially for sleep tracking.  I don't know about the step tracking - it seems very generous, giving me credit for about 25% more steps than my AppleWatch.  I haven't been brave enough to do the body composition yet, but I do have a mirror, so I'm not completely out of touch.  Dislike: the battery life. I've got to charge it every day.  I was hoping for better.",4
1378,"It's okay, but not worth $4 a month. I have worn it consistently for 6 months of free trial. Amazon just graciously extended that for another 3 or 4 months, but I think that I will probably not wear it as much. I admit that I did not use it to track my tone or my body mass, too invasive for me. So it has become pretty much a glorified pedometer that does not even tell time. I did try some of the sleep enhancement videos, but they did not suggest anything that I already did not know. For me, it's an okay pedometer...",3
1379,"Definitely a really good band. Provides good insight about health and fitness. In fact I like more than apple watch ( which I use just for timer and apple pay). However this band charging adapter is the worst. I have used many other fitness tracker. Look at the attached picture this is how I charge, it's not even 3 months. It's expensive to buy new one.",4
1380,"I was super excited about the Halo, because it didnt have the unnecessary techy features that I hate in ""smart watches"". It seems like it's pretty accurate in tracking sleep, activity, and excersize but it completely ignores tone now. I have gone through all FAQ's and help pages, but it stopped tracking after about 1 week. The tone that it did track the words more than the tone. For example if I said ""oh no"" even in a super happy voice, it would register as ""sad or depressed"".",3
1381,"I have held off getting one of these.  I am a bit fan of Amazon so I decided to try it.  I thought it was good it didn't have a watch, but now I wish it did! Now I am wearing the Amazon Halo and a watch.  I like the sleep monitoring and the use of points not just steps!  If Amazon comes out with a new one with a watch function I would upgrade!",4
1382,"Easy to use app, comfortable band, I do wish the app could track food intake also though - I'm still having to use another app to track food. I use the body scanner / sleep and activity part of the app.  I don't use the voice part (Tone) - creeps me out the idea of it listening to me.  If Amazon could add the food tracking part - I think this Halo band would be perfect!",4
1383,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Halo!! Best fitness band I've owned. The fact that it does your body fat percentage is absolutely a plus. I would have of gave it 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I do wish it tracked BeachBody workouts specifically since that's mostly what I do. But it does have the option to log a workout yourself. I got mine in rose gold, small, and ordered the hummingbird band to go with it.",4
1384,"My issues were mostly me being abnormal and the device just couldn't pair well. For example, it would give me mod intesity exercise points for being anxious. It would tell me I didn't sleep well, to take it easy and dock points for doing so. The app often had difficulties syncing, I even repeated the movement accessment four times in a day with no successful update to my percentages. I'm also recovering from lung surgery, I just don't reach average often enough.",3
1385,"Cannot recommend. My wife got this halo band as a promo a couple years ago, but it sat around unopened. I finally had my Garmin device break (after what was probably considerable physical abuse, but it had lasted a long time). So she gave me the halo. Set it up and everything was OK. I wasn't impressed with much about the device or the app. A month after activating the device, it quit charging. Followed the troubleshooting steps and still not charging. Went to support & they said to purchase new charger & they would refund purchase upon delivery. Device still would not charge with new charger. They won't do a replacement of the band since it was a promo. Also, they went back on the refund upon delivery of the replacement charger & said it had to be returned. I will not even consider any Amazon fitness tracker in the future.  Will probably go back to Garmin.",1
1386,"Very happy with this product after months of use. In comparison to other wearables on the market I think Amazon has done a great job at differentiating themselves with all of the cool and unique features of this band(voice analysis, body fat calculation via AI, temperature sensors etc.)I have tried almost every wearable out there (settled on using this and a whoop). Accuracy of this device is great in regards to sleep tracking and its nice that they threw in temperature sensors(can even get full 24hr data by doing an export in app).In the future it would be nice to see additions made for HRV/stress analysis, SPo2(although this is useless for most people).",5
1387,I’ve been using this for almost 2 months and love it. I would suggest sizing down in the band I went by what the measurements suggested not what my gut said and it’s too large. My only other complaint is that the band doesn’t lay as well as it did when it was new. This has caused some pulling in sweaters so I’d be careful with what you wear it with after it starts to lift.,4
1388,"I really like the Halo band. It is great at tracking sleep and activities. The app is easy to use and has a lot of great features. Just one question: why can't it tell time? If I'm wearing this on my wrist anyway, I'd like it to be a watch too.",4
1389,"I think the Halo band still has quite a way to go to be considered a good activity tracker. I was a very loyal Jawbone UpBand user until they stopped making the activity tracker. I was most interested in the sleep tracking function and Halo is far inferior in my opinion. If I'm lying in bed reading for 30 minutes before going to sleep, Halo counts that 30 minutes as ""time to fall asleep"" and includes that in rating the quality of my sleep. The weekly activity ""points"" calculation is also a bit odd. Overall I would not recommend and am considering returning it.",3
1390,A lot of these gripes are about not having a screen. But that’s the purpose of this device. Tracking without distraction which may not work with everyone but works for some. I love it. I have a Apple Watch and haven’t been using it since the pandemic Bc I work in healthcare. I am loving the halo Bc of how small it is on my wrist  and how people don’t even realize it’s a device. I love that there is no screen. I hate being locked into technology at my wrist. I like that it’ll track sleep movement and even tone. If you’re really into technology and smart watches this isn’t right for you.,5
1391,Picked this up for the minimal design and the price was right.The body comp scan was within 2% of my dexa so can't complain there.Sleep tracking is a bit wonky if you fall asleep on it.I like the scoring system. Get x points for movement based on heart rate and I really like that the points are weighted based on quality and not just quantity,4
1392,"The design is fine, the sleep tracking is adequate, doesn't predict sleep times too well thought. The app and the graphing is trash, moving through the various screens and timelines doesn't feel intuitive at all and is rather sluggish.Biggest complaint by far is the heart rate and activity tracker. It almost always misses detection of high intensity activities. I'll be huffing and panting feeling like my heart is racing and going to pop and yet the live heart rate display shows me at 90bpm. I was confused so I tried the abnd at multiple tightness and locations but no avail. So I compared it to a gold standard chest band and also tried counting my pulses, off by a whopping 180-210% so at that point, I'm not exactly inclined to believe any of the data collected.It is comfortable to wear tho, so if they were to actually get their hardware to work, I'll be inclined to keep it on 24x7.Didn't try their tone but my girlfriend did and found it to be rather inaccurate and often entirely missed conversations altogether.",2
1393,"Ok.. so I'm not going to go into specifics, but I literally count for a living. It's to the point, unfortunately, I count in my sleep.That being said........I wanted to try and see how dead on accurate the step counter is on this device. I literally counted every single step I took from my bedroom to my front door of my house (In normal routine everyday speed). I even counted the halfway 'kind of steps'.Unfortunately, Amazon Halo literally, just over, doubled the amount of steps i took. Sooooo accuracy... not good. If it says you took 37,000 steps today. Think again... more like 15,000.",3
1394,"Update 2/18/2021: Bought a new cell phone a couple weeks ago. Have been unable to pair the device with the new phone. Probably a good portion of the problem is that in order to pair, it has to be in the charging clip. Yup, the same charging clip that barely recognizes it for charging purposes. So yeah, unable to use the product at all any more. It was a waste of money.Update 1/31/2021: After leaving the review with the charging difficulties, Amazon Customer Service reached out and offered to send a new charger. I accepted and unfortunately, the update is that there is absolutely no change. It still takes anywhere from 5-15 minutes to wiggle and giggle the Halo until it starts charging. Just when I'm ready to give up and pronounce it garbage, the red charging light will finally come on. This is just too much hassle when it should be easy to drop it in the charger and have it immediately start charging.Original review: Charging is a nightmare. Ever since I received it, I find it is very difficult to align it on the charger. In the beginning, I blamed it on myself, a learning curve to figure out correct placement. To this day, when it is time to charge, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I will spend 10-15 minutes just trying to get the red light to come on. Ridiculous. It should not be that difficult. Because of this, I will not be using this device any longer.",1
1395,"I bought Halo almost a year ago, with great anticipation, because I thought it would give me insight and motivation. I wanted to hear how I sounded to others and learn more about my health.Since I have had it it has lost connectivity at least 3 times, and currently I am unable to get it to pair, AGAIN! I went looking to return it and it says my window for returns has closed so now I'm stuck with a device that won't pair and really doesn't offer much more than what any of the other typical trackers do.Honestly, I can feel good skipping out on paying Amazon anymore of my money and opt out. I'll take the hit for making the purchase, but pass along this info to you, so you can make better choices-that being,  not this device.",2
1396,"This device was not for me.  Using it almost two weeks, it gave a sleep report just one time.  Confusing since it warns you it might not track sleep if it's too loose OR too tight.  Wearing it correctly proved to be a mystery quantum I never achieved.  The step count varied wildly from that of my iWatch.  All in all, it was way more trouble than it was worth.  I'll be handing it off to someone else.",3
1397,"Easy to use, love it it has helped me so much tracking my sleep, and my heart rate!! Definitely would order it again and I love that I can get healthy recipes from the app too!! If you have a problem with sleeping and tracking ur sleep Definitely would recommend this..it tells how long it took u to fall asleep how long u stayed asleep and tells u when u slept the hardest light and in between hard and light sleeping and for how long..I bought it mostly for tracking my sleep and heart rate..",5
1398,"I’ve had this for a year and it definitely has more faults than benefits, especially once the membership expires.  I bought it for sleep tracking and heart rate monitoring. It tracks my HR fine.  It’s a decent pedometer.  But…The sleep tracking sucks eggs.  If I slept all night it tells me I got up 6 times.  It also doesn’t accurately track when sleep starts and stops. Last night I slept from 10:30ish to 7.  This morning when I check it tells me I was asleep from 1am to 6am.There is a feature in the app that allows you to “set” your sleep time, but it can only be adjusted by a minute or so… which makes it completely pointless.I can’t remark on the body imaging or tone because I never had the urge to try it.",2
1399,"I became interested in the Halo Band last month during Prime Day, when it was discounted heavily.  I liked that it was small, unobtrusive, and did things like sleep tracking -- while I already have an Apple watch, the Apple Watch's battery life isn't quite good enough for overnight wear, while the Halo Band had a claimed life of almost a week (without Tone).  I was also looking for a device that I could wear while exercising, and my Apple watch is too big.  The only real drawback is that the standard band irritated my skin a bit and a replacement silicone band let the thing pop out easily.Unfortunately, the band stopped charging a few nights ago, and Amazon won't replace it.  They were willing to refund me for the (discounted) price I paid and add some money on top, but that's not enough to buy a replacement and I'm not sure I want to spend even more money on something that breaks after a month.",1
1400,"I’m very surprised how the device struggles to sync after it’s removed from the charging bay. I had to call tech support to get it synced the first time be side it wasn’t behaving as the instructions specified. Even though it’s been synced to my iPhone, I have to sync after each recharge cycle. It makes no sense that d set other device connects as long as it’s in range of my phone, but the Halo needs to be synced manually every time...which is often. The battery last a day and a half. I can get 5 days out of my knockoff Apple Watch.",3
1401,"I really like this product ! Its lightweight, waterproof and doesn't light up at night like the fitbit does.  I love the sleep tracker, seems accurate.  I love the fact that it tracks the tone in my voice! Its very helpful in my job honestly. The only down fall is the battery life, lasts 3 days ( I wear it 24hours a day with voice detect) Even with that I still highly recommend!It is not a fitbit, do not expect it to be!  This is a first gen fitness/sleep/tone tracker. It has kinks but I was a happy tester for it.  Overall, if you give it more than a 3 day chance, I think you will like it. It has to get to know your body first before it shows you all its magic!",5
1402,"I got this for Christmas and except for charging, have worn it continuously since. It seems to do an okay job with activity tracking, but sleep tracking is not good. For example, last night it recorded that I slept from about 10:3.0 pm until about 5:15 am. That much is accurate. However, our neighbors have a new dog that they keep outside. It was barking from about 2:30 am until 3:30 am. I know this because I was awake and reading the entire time. However, Halo told me I was in light sleep. To be completely wrong for that length of time is just bad tracking.UPDATEI have canceled my Halo subscription because the sleep tracking continues to just be wrong.  In addition to problems with the sleep tracking, its activity tracking is puzzling.  I have used it to track activity and it seems to arbitrarily decide what is ""intense"" enough to qualify for activity.  One reviewed quite aptly described it as demoralizing.  This means that for the 2 main purposes in my life, activity and sleep tracking, this device is just bad.  If you are looking for a more accurate tracker, my wife uses an Oura ring.  It seems to be pretty accurate.",1
1403,"I wore the Amazon Halo for two months, and I have recently decided to stop wearing it. I think this device might be useful to someone who doesn't have a gauge on their activity level, but if you are pretty active, you probably already know your daily activity level and how many steps you average. (I never really ""figured out"" the activity points this uses either and what they mean.)The body composition feature generally works as advertised, but the three-dimensional model of your body it creates is creepy and the estimated BMI seems off.The most disappointing feature for me was the sleep scoring, which, for me, wasn't encouraging and just made me feel bad about myself. Who wants to wake up to being told by a device that your sleep was ""poor?"" The language and clinical reports were just a big bring down.I never used the voice analysis feature for the simple reason that I do not trust Amazon with my voice data and *especially* with recordings of important conversations in my life.Meh. I'm moving on.",2
1404,"I was very excited to try this out by it has been overall fairly disappointing. I don't even bother with the tone analysis anymore because it just kills the battery.  The heart rate monitor doesn't seem particularly accurate I've had it say 47 when in the middle of a heavy workout and it's done this to me a few times.  And the body scan was way off the mark, ive been to a really expensive bod pod measurements and my scale is closer then the scan was....Best thing I can say about it is that I only paid half price....",3
1405,"I bought this because I was most interested in the voice tracking.  It did not do what I expected and drained the battery quickly.  However, I love the sleep tracking and activity counter.  I use them both daily.  I wish the band wasn’t cloth because it gets dirty quickly.  The app is simple and easy to use.  I like this item and I am glad I bought it.",4
1406,"For me since day one months ago it does what was advertised. Seems fairly accurate with tracking sleep and activity. If you read the details, specs regarding the band and app it does what it advertises. Many useful videos for those who are interested in that information. Provides well rounded content for their app (diet, exercise, mental wellbeing) from a variety of resources.",4
1407,"I got it to try. I wasn't keen  on the fitbits and such. First day on, it counted my typing as steps, showed i had done 1,800 steps when all i did was sit...then the next day i worked at a fair taking money at the gate and it registered 25,000 steps ( which possibly could be true). The sleep function is nice.  The tone function I laugh about. I work Customer service and having it tell me ""my tone"" is very interesting.",3
1408,"I've been using this for two weeks. I wanted the device for sleep monitoring and to measure heart rate and get an idea of the calories burned in a day and the number of steps.  The sleep feature works great, I have no issue with the app.  The heart rate monitor only worked for a week.  Now it routinely reports a heart rate twice the actual value.  If that is is factored into calorie consumption - then I cannot trust those number either.  I can get better information using two fingers on my wrist.  I've tried all the recommended steps, ensuring the device is connected via blue-tooth (it is), reposition the device (done many times), ensure the band is charged... in essence the ""help"" provided is not helpful.  In addition, if you do anything that required repetitive motion, steps are erroneously counted.  I only use the band for sleep monitoring now. Very disappointed.",2
1409,"I've discovered that the tone feature actually weights the words said more than the actual tone. It's not able to distinguish between a sincere ""Thank you!"" and a sarcastic ""Thanks a lot,"" or a happy ""That's great!"" and a frustrated ""That's just great"" - rates them all as appreciative, proud, satisfied. Tone is *more* important in communication than words - this really renders the tone feature pretty useless. If this feature is important to you, realize that it may not give you accurate feedback.Also, after just three weeks, the device no longer uploads any activity or sleep data, despite being charged and worn correctly.  It can track my heart rate and tone using the ""Live"" feature, but even though the app says it is synced, there is no data for activity or sleep from the last 48 hours.My last complaint is that the app takes away activity points if you are sedentary too long, but it doesn't have any way to prompt you to get up and move.  This is pretty demotivating.  It really needs the ability to give a phone notification to move, or better yet, the band needs to be able to give a vibratory reminder.  At this point I wish I had had bought a more expensive fitness tracker - I don't need all the features other bands offer, but at least they might work as advertised.  If my Halo can't start to sync data correctly I will return it.",1
1410,The cover over the sensor area has fallen of my halo device. I am trying to contact the customer service dept to see about getting it repaired but that is proving to be a challenge. I have enjoyed my experience with the device so far. Customer service has reached out and is sending a replacement.  Once it is received I have to send my current device to them. The turn around time for them to contact me was quick and they have been super helpful.,3
1411,"After approximately 2 months of constant use it has started to fail.Resting HR works fine but when partaking in higher intensity exercise it's about 40BPM off compared to my Garmin w.chest strap and Pulse Ox meter.** Positives **Small form factor, totally forget it's on my wristFast chargingUI is cleanMotivation from Halo Mothers guilt versus Garmins girlfriends nagging-- Negatives --Battery life, wish it would last the full weekAccuracy of higher intensity HR** Update ** old Halo being returned, new Halo on the way. Increasing to 3 stars based on proactive call from Halo Customer Service.",3
1412,I LOVE the idea and execution of this band in all ways except one. The battery. Not only does it die quickly (even with all the time tone turned off) but it takes FOREVER to charge! I really want this band to keep being my go to but it's such a pain to have to leave it charging for so long every other day! Would be interested in the next version and hopeful improvements.,4
1413,"This fitness band has potential.  Now in the Beta trial, there are a few things that could be better.  In my personal experience, the sleep function doesn't work.  It says I'm sleeping when I'm actually eating dinner, so the whole timeline is off.  The tone function works, but it sucks the battery dry in no time, so I have turned this function off.  The ""labs"" are decent, especially during Covid when it's hard to get to the gym.  Overall, I think it could be a good thing, with a little more work.  One more thing - it hasn't been easy to access support.",3
1414,"Activities tracking, voice tracking and heart rate monitor seem to be pretty damn good but I question tge body fat feature. I lost 15 lbs in a month but the body fat % actually went up 1%. I would pay for tge service but I will say that the Halo helps keep me active which is mist important and the sleep tracking is great and fairly accurate. I'd buy it again if I had to.",4
1415,The Halo has been great!Keeps track of my steps and and sleep.This helps me lose weight and take care of my sleeping habits.,5
1416,"...however all of a sudden it takes forever to charge.  It used to charge super fast... one day it just decided it didn't want to anymore.  I use the same charger, same everything.  Very disappointing.  And most of the features seem to be less accurate as well.I will say I haven't gotten around to using the body measurement feature.The sleep tracker constantly says that it couldn't get an accurate read because i moved in my sleep.The tone feature works less and less.#regrets #buyersremorse",3
1417,"I've been wearing mine for a week.  It's light, easy to wear, and unless I think about it, it's unnoticable.  But I guess I was expecting it to do more than track my activity and my sleep.  Nor does it do either of those very well.  I haven't tried the tone of voice thing yet.  The body imaging thing is at the same time cool and pretty depressing.  I notice that the Halo is currently unavailable, maybe Amazon is installing upgrades and is going to reissue a new and improved model later.",3
1418,"The Halo band is perfect for anyone. The app stays updated all the time. I wish the battery last longer, although i do use the voice recognition.",5
1419,Love shopping at Amazon,4
1420,"I like the idea that it monitors your health, tone, exercise. I like the idea of the labs and tips to keep a healthy lifestyle. I think it does need to do more to help actually push change in our daily habits for exercise / tone or whatever someone is working on. The Body Fat photo taking freaked me out a bit, but I guess I'm over it. The charging clip works so so. When I slide my bracelet in, I have to push it down to make sure it's charging. Overall, I like the idea and concept, but I think they will need to make improvements over time.",3
1421,"Accuracy on the step counter is waaay off. It counts HIGH.The sleep tracker seems about right when compared to a Fitbit and my sleep habits. The sleep labs don't help me, but I need quiet when I sleep. Not ""white noise"" it gentle music or whatever.The ""tone of voice"" analyzer is ludicrous to me. I tried it for a while and turned it off. I KNOW how I sound to others and this stupid software DOESN'T.  I'm really not sure why this feature was even included. It's dumb.I haven't used the body fat analyzer yet, mostly out of concern about privacy of the photos you have to take to use it.Overall, the sleep tracker is what I have used it for. I quit wearing it all day since the step counter is so far off, and only wear it at night to bed.I think Amazon has a fair amount of work to do on the feature set and accuracy of the Halo. I'd give it a C- as it stands right now.EDIT 11Feb 2021: So my return window closed on 31Jan. Now the Halo won't charge at all. Yes, I know about giving the clip an extra slight squeeze when the Halo is put in its' jaws. Been charging OK since I got it. But now, not even 2 weeks past the return window, the charger is non-functional. Dropping review to 1 star. Really wish I had never bought this thing. Really disappointed in Amazon on this one.",1
1422,"I had never taken the plunge to buy a fitness tracker before, but I love the idea of getting an exclusive item, so I got the Halo on its early release. It's not terrible, it's just not for me.I just feel like it's pointless to have the blocky thing on your wrist and it can't even tell you the time. I get the minimalist thing, but it just looks like a fitbit with the face covered in cloth. It's annoying to have to take out my phone to track everything.The bmi tracker freaked me out, so I only did it once.As far as the Tone feature, I found that even if I left the option on and it drained my battery, it wasn't giving me any impact my on tone. It only seemed to worked if I recorded a conversation through the app, and that really wasn't something I ever remembered to do.The sleep tracker was okayI just feel like the for the price, you may as well get a tracker with a face.",2
1423,So far it’s been better at sleep tracking than the Auto-sleep app for IPhone. The tone of voice function is either not reliable or I speak like a condescending jerk. It’s probably reliable lol. I haven’t tried the body analysis yet so can’t speak to it. The charger is a little flimsy. I have to press down on the top to get it engaged with the charging leads. Overall a solid first effort by Amazon.,4
1424,"Very cool device. Just wish it was disconnected from an information technology giant.I used for sleep tracking. It seemed to do a pretty accurate job. Was awesome to see my metrics.I did not upload pictures of my body to Amazon. I did not activate the voice tone feature either.It wasn't because I'm not interested in the features, but more that I hate the thought of sending even more data to the same company that listens to everything that already goes on in my living room.If there was a monthly fee for deleting my data, I'd be interested in signing up for that.",3
1425,Unless they get a better band don’t waste your money on the watch one broke 2 within 3 months stopped asking for replacement,5
1426,"I am using Halo currently for sleep tracking and once the pandemic has passed, I will also use it to track swimming. I have a small wrist and I wish that the device was a bit smaller. It feels rather bulky on my wrist. I am a side sleeper and Halo is a bit noticeable as I am falling asleep.Overall, I like it. Hopefully, the next version will be smaller.",4
1427,I've really enjoyed wearing this device.  I dont need the distraction of a screen on the band.I love that it tracks so many different aspects of my health.My favorite part is probably the sleep tracker.  I've got sleep issues and this helps me confirm some of my suspected issues.  I also enjoy the voice tracker.  Kind of fun to see how my kids make me a little crazy and loving at the same time.It's great for steps and I like being able to track my heart rate at any time.This is Amazon first fitness tracker and I'm happy with the results.  I've been wearing it for months and intend to keep wearing it.  My husband is going to start wearing one too because I've enjoyed it so much.,5
1428,"Been using whoop for 2 years and just added Halo a month ago. I like the body scan feature as a pro bodybuilder especially when cutting. However for halo to surpass whoop, they need to add 1) HRV/Recovery tracking and 2) ability to start and track activity real time vs. automatic detection (which is inaccurate) or logging/editing after completion.",4
1429,"I have been using for about a month now. Compared to my Polar Unite watch, it tracks steps, heart rate and sleep about the same.  The stats that are given are very basic, if you want detailed stats go with a different tracker. The Tone tracking is interesting, I find it a bit amusing. You do have to use the app to view your stats. I would like to see more integration with other apps, right now it is only WW and John Hancock Vitality.  Halo band is very lightweight and not bad for Amazon’s first tracker but there are better trackers out there.",3
1430,"Product was pretty cool. I had a lot of problems with the app because I was usung Android 7. The body scan couldn't work on older Android version. I had the band over a year now. The tracker stopped working and heart rate monitor yesterday. This morning I try fixing it by doing a factory reset and unpaired the device. It still didn't work and I noticed the back panel was lose. As you can see in the picture the device is dead. It's still able to charge and connect to my phone. All the important stuff is gone. No sleep tracking, steps or heart rate. Plus the year warranty is over. The device is supposed to be waterproof. I believe the back was poorly designed. Halo band needs to be redesign. I was one of the early bird testers.",2
1431,"I really wanted to like this tracker.  I liked the app.  I liked the device.  Sleep tracking and encouragements were great.  I was only able to wear it for about 2 weeks though.  I noticed some skin irritation on the back of my wrist after wearing a couple of days.  It wasn't bad though, and since I was not use to wearing anything on my wrist, I thought it was just my skin adjusting or something.  I put aloe on it and continued wearing the Halo.  I woke up one morning after wearing for about 2 weeks and the skin irritation was more like a burn.  I immediately removed the device, treated the skin, and wrapped in a bandage.  It took over a week to completely heal.  Not sure exactly what caused the irritation but I returned the Halo.  I got a different fitness tracker and no skin irritation with it, so it was definitely the Halo.  I was very disappointed because I like a lot of the Halo features.",2
1432,"Doesn't work consistently!  Mine worked ok for the first month.  So I got my boyfriend one for Christmas. His has never worked for the voice recognition and both of our bands have been sporadic when it come to recording sleep and activity.  The mobile app is clunky and slow.  I like that is gives you challenges and suggestions for improving your sleep amd upping your activity, but the tracking is often inaccurate or it just randomly doesn't record.  So many nights I wear it, and in the am there is no sleep info.  Then sometimes, later in the day, the sleep info will appear.  Also the battery life is minuscule.  At first it was holding a charge for 2 days, now I have to charge it almost everyday.  The only thing that was super cool and I still would use it for is the body composition. I was really excited for this band, and now I feel like I just wasted my money.",2
1433,"I currently own a Garmin which accomplishes all the fitness features this watch offers and more; however when the Tone feature was introduced I was very excited to learn our I sounded and how it might enlighten me on my current mood.  I am greatly disappointed that after receiving my first one, it failed to recognize my tone after numerous attempts to set it up.  There is limited support available online and absolutely NO Tech Support for trouble shooting this feature as I was told by Amazon when I contacted them an informed them I couldn't find it.  They offered me two available options, one was a refund and the other was a replacement.  Hopeful that it was just a defective unit I opted for the replacement and thus I have received the same issue.  Suspecting it might be my phone I attempted this with a different device (I owned a Samsung Galaxy J7) so I tried it on the Apple Iphone 10 and same results.I did find the HR accurate when compared to my other HR devices and Chest strap.  The Sleep and activity functions (steps etc) all function well and was insightful but nothing that other products on the market do not currently offer.Until there is improvement I would advise people to opt for the alternate watches if you already have one that performs all the health functions this one offers as the Tone feature which sets this apart still has bugs to work out.",1
1434,"This fitness tracker has potential. I got it in the early access and was super excited for it. The app is an easy set up and the band is a nice look. However i came from an apple to watch this and it not having a face/ time on it was something i couldn't handle. lol but i figured i could wear it on my other wrist because I've recently gotten back into fitness and wanted to track everything. However, after connecting it to the Bluetooth and setting it up on my phone for the first time, after it died and i tried to reconnect it, it wouldn't. I tried for about a week straight everyday and it would take foreverrrrr to load(never loaded). I got frustrated and ended up sending it back. When it did track my fitness through out the first couple days before dying out for good, it was an okay tracker. Not super accurate. I'm sure they'll come out with a new and improved and i can't wait to see how different/ better it is or isnt.",2
1435,It does everything it says but it's just so basic. I don't know if the voice judgment part is worth much since it only picks ups some conversations to judge tone. But it's not a bad product just wish there was maybe a little more to it. For $99 plus monthly charge to keep it going. Im not sure if I will keep it after my trial is up. Wish maybe it was also a watch or did more for the monthly fee be worth it.,3
1436,"I'm a little surprised by some of the negative reviews on this. I love the halo. Yes there are times where I wish it had a face so I could see the time and my steps but honestly that's also a benefit for me because I'm not constantly looking at my wrist like I did when I had a smart watch.The sleep tracking is great, heart tracking is pretty spot on and the body tracking is pretty cool. The tone thing also helped me see how I might sound to others so I have become more mindful of how I speak as well. I don't use the labs much, yet, but the few I have were pretty cool.If I had one critique it would be for it to display the time but that's it.",5
1437,"I bought the Halo Band when they first came out. The band was OK, and it was hard getting used to not being able to see anything on it. Then less than a year later, out came the Halo View, which I loved. It was the Halo Band but now had a view screen on the device (you no longer had to look at the app for all your stats). Well, it took less than three months for that to break, and if you read the reviews, EVERYONE's is breaking. There is a design flaw where the device attaches to the band. SOOO... I went back to this regular Halo, that had less than a year's usage on it. I wore it for just a couple weeks, and one day I noticed it was not syncing. I kept trying to sync and finally took it off to look at it. The back cover piece (that secures the battery and tracking part), fell off! The little gasket that was holding it on, just disintegrated into goo.  I'm not going to be replacing the Halo with any other Halo, Original or View. It is absolutely discouraging that Amazon is unable to make a fitness tracker that lasts for more than a few months.  I will say that the Halo app is awesome. But you have to have a band connected to it to use it fully.",1
1438,"You'll notice that I'm still wearing my Fitbit Inspire. I'm not very impressed with the Halo. There are a couple features that I like like the workout and meditation vids in labs. But you can only continue to get them if you pay for a subscription. (3.99 per month is not that). There's no place to input actual water intake or food intake. I turned off the tone two days in after it told me I sounded ""condescending"". Maybe it gets better later. I'm not very active right now due to the holidays and hand 🧶 crocheting gifts... But so far, I'm waiting to be impressed.",3
1439,"The electronic square tracking is to big and digs into your arm. Not comfortable to wear.Its also a pain to charge this with the awful clip charge system. You have to play with it sometimes for 5 minutes adjusting it to charge and get the red light on. otherwise you clip it to charge and it doesnt do it when you go back to check.the app is fine. lots of stuff to read and use. the sleep tracker is great as well.needs a complete redesign. smaller tracker, and usb plug charge or back charger. the clip has to go.",3
1440,"It's okay. The best part of this are the fitness programs found on the app. Think of this device as literally a tracker. I do wear it everyday, but it really adds nothing. I look on my wrist and no time is reported... One of the fitness programs introduced me to StreetParking and that alone is 5 stars. For my next fitness tracker, I think I'd like to have a watch at least.",3
1441,"If all you are looking to do is track your fitness and sleep, then this product does a good job of that. The battery life is pretty good, about 4-5 days between charges.

I can't connect it to my Google fit account or my meal tracking apps.",3
1442,"I got this for the Fat scanner. It was less accurate than I hoped. Stopped connecting to my phone around 6 months in so I gave it up.

I had the product for 4 months and then it started malfunctioning to the point where it’s too annoying to even try to mess with it .

Good application but cheap hardware",3
1444,"I absolutely love all the features of this fitness tracker without all the distractions. It tracks my sleep which has been a big part of by hypertension and weight gain. It tracks my workouts and intensity. I even like the tone feedback which I really didn’t expect to. But the absolutely best part, is the body composition tracking. People pay big money for this on the regular . I can get it whatever. It definitely  set me free from the discouraging scale when i could see my body fat literally melting away a d my lean muscle increasing. While the scale may only change by small amounts my body is dramatically changing. Literally have clothes falling off. Waste measurements down and the tone is amazing especially since I like to weight train.",5
1445,"Super cool concept, I've learned much about my sleep since using it. I think the voice recognition software needs some work, it very often hears my TV or other sounds and mistakes them for things I saidMY BIGGEST GRIPE IS THE CHARGING CLAMP! Seems extremely cheaply made and the device itself does not sit well in it. More often than not oh, I find myself fidgeting with the Charger and fit band for a minute before it's seated correctly in charging. As of now, I don't see divice worth the monthly fee.",3
1446,"I have had the Halo for several months now, and have worn it every day.  I was curious about how it would match up against my Fitbit, and overall I am disappointed.  I miss having the visible info on my wrist (time, texts, phone, basic fitness data).  The other big turnoff for me is the battery life.  For the first few months, it was adequate..I only needed to charge it about 1x every week or two.  Recently, it seems to drain much faster and I need to charge it every day or two.  I do not take advantage of all of the interactive features available through the app.  I was curious at first and tried several of them out, but I do not use it regularly, and certainly not enough to consider a subscription going forward.  It sounded interesting in concept...but it's not meeting my expectations.  I will be going back to my fitbit as my full time wearable device.",2
1447,"I love everything about the Halo, but that the band has to be so snug to keep an accurate reading. I have yet to set up voice recognition but I will be doing that soon. Everything else has been so accurate that I can't believe at times it's better than my watch. I compare the two when I wear my watch. I don't wear my watch when I go sleep at night because that it when I charge it. But there are times I take a nap during the day and that is when I find that the status is different. It blows my mind. I wish I could have found the Halo band earlier!",5
1448,"I like the Body Scan feature a lot, as it's something completely unique to Halo (as far as I know). The tone feature is also something I haven't seen on other devices that I've used, but doesn't really work that well because it seems to track other voices like the TV. I tried not talking all day and it had just as many tone reports as other days. The sleep tracking is okay, but doesn't provide as much information as the last Fitbit that I used or the 3rd party apps with Apple Watch. I also found no use for any of the Labs, but maybe others will.The best feature is that after 3 months, mine started having daily issues with syncing and would miss my sleep data every night. I would get a message to double press band button to sync, but nothing would ever happen. Found ""fixes"" online, like force closing the app, turning the phone on/off, and then resetting the band and that would fix it for a day and then I'd have to do it again the next. After about 2 days of going through this process, it got the point that this wouldn't work at all. I finally got it working again by deregistering the band and going through the entire setup process again. I have zero confidence that this will stay working and expect to give up on this product forever (unless Amazon is first to figuring out how to get accurate real-time blood glucose readings).",1
1449,Best sleep tracker I’ve used.I have Apple Watch but it needs to be charged everyday and really not convenient to use it to track sleep. Amazon halo gives me everything I wanted. It’s what I would be designing if I were to build one. I had some trouble with sleep and this product showed me how bad it was and which part was bad.  I put an effort in getting a good sleep and I could see my score improving. All the statistics about my sleep are awesome!I use some of the programs as well. Meditations are from other apps like headspace. They are pretty neat.The BMI calculation was my main reason to purchase. It’s much more accurate than my scale.,5
1450,"Amazing ambitious device.  You don't just track sleep - you get results and experiments called 'labs' to impact your wellness.  You don't just count steps - you get a score based on your fitness impact of your efforts.  You don't just track your mood, it's inferred by your tone of voice, even in a live setting that is hilarious for conversations with partners.  All this... but with a battery life so bad you have to charge the device multiple times a day.  Very cool system.  Problematic hardware design.  My recommendation is to look forward to v2.",3
1451,"I purchased this item in November 2020. I was extremely pleased with it (still am)! HOWEVER, the cheap, flimsy charger has stopped working! I have tried everything posters have suggested: gently squeezing it over the band, cleaning the contact points, turning the charger upside down... nothing works! I have tried to look for a replacement charger, to no avail! I am unable to locate a customer service number to call to order a replacement. So to say I am not pleased is a understatement. Can anyone advise where one can purchase a replacement charger?",3
1452,"I've had it for about a week and... well... It tracks my heart rate and it tracks my sleep. It also tracks my steps, but doesn't let me set goals that I can find. I just turned on tone tracking, but I'm not going to pay for a service whose only differentiating factor is tracking the tone of my voice.No alarms. No notifications of any kind.I'm just not impressed.If you're looking for something new and groundbreaking, this isn't it. I bought it on payments and will make said payments, but I won't continue the subscription after the free trial.",3
1453,"So I've used a few fitness bands, mainly fitbits, which I've generally liked. The Halo, however, was... underwhelming.My biggest complaint is that it doesn't really improve on what's already on the market. It's bodyfat analyzer seems grossly inaccurate. The newly created metric for activity points didn't seem particularly useful. And worst is that by not having a watch face, I always have to open the app in order to find out any information including my heartrate, which makes doing so cumbersome.It's not a bad piece of technology, it just doesn't improve on what's already out there.",3
1454,"Pro: Sleep tracking seems fairly accurate*, and the tone function is interesting.Cons: Syncing doesn’t work half the time which makes for a very frustrating experience.*Sleep tracking only seems to track one sleep experience per day. If you take a nap, or wake up for more than an hour in the middle of the night it does not count everything toward your sleep average for the day.Overall the current Halo experience isn't terrible but it is underwhelming. Halo has the potential to be very informative, so I am hoping with software updates things get better.",3
1455,"I got this pre-general availability as part of the WW / Weight watchers partnership marketing and to ditch my FitBit. Sleep is one of the primary things I personally am always wanting to track. The sleep has never worked but I was at least told initially that it was being worked on. Now WW simply says the Halo is not a device supported to sync sleep seriously.I’ll be cancelling this for the monthly membership. I considered going back to Fitbit however now that they are part of Google no way, I’m shopping for a Garmin Vivosmart 4.",3
1456,"This is not necessarily a bad product, it is just very limited on what it can do. It does what is advertised, but I guess I thought it would do more, but it just can't. So just do your research to make sure you are buying it for the right reason. Again, it isn't a bad product, I just did not make a good consumer choice based on my needs.",3
1457,"Sleep is good, tone is interesting especially when it’s at 2AM while sleeping.. What it is missing that I really would like would be heart rate history where it gathers data throughout the day. I doubt I will continue the subscription but I would pay for that information if it were possible. Battery life is the other negative. Really like the fabric band that I didn’t have for other devices.",4
1458,"Charger needs work.  Does not align easily.  Customer service and Tech team are great.  Very responsive.  Look forward to seeing the product continue to develop.  Would like to see the ability to do more then five programs in a week.  Again, good product.  Unique with the whole body scan thing.  Makes me want to work harder on my health.",4
1459,"Wish it showed the time. Also - after about a month’s wear - finding it difficult to charge. I place in charger, but the light no longer comes on or let’s me know when charged.",4
1460,"I have been using Fitbit for long time (and I still wear it along my Halo). I would be ready to move to use only Halo except two things: rest of people in my steps competition group are not using Halo, and I really like battery life of Fitbit as compared to Halo's battery life.But I would pick Halo without hesitation if only features were the deciding factor. I really like the body fat monitoring, I think it is much better than BMI and weight alone. Likewise, the activity monitoring with points is in my mind better just plain steps, The voice tone monitoring is kind ok, but is not useful because of its battery usage. In fact I find the poor battery life the biggest problem with Halo.",5
1461,I found some difficulty setting this up for my wife but I am impatient and she figured it out I would like to say this is a very neat item.More so I would like to say that I got frustrated and Amazon's technical support was literally able to reach out to me and help it was amazing Amazon's support rocks and for this I love them thank you Amazon for helping,3
1462,"I have used the Halo to help me stay accountable for my exercise habits, and I continue on my weight loss journey.It is very good with helping me keep ""heart healthy goals"" as well as time where I have been to sedentary. It helps measure my sleep, and offers ways to improve it.  The body fat tracker is the worse part of the mobile app. It doesn't work. I've tried several times.",4
1463,"I love this thing no screen to look at and it has made me more health conscious.  Mobile app needs refreshed to link to watch. All in all , it's a great investment, especially if your concerned with health",5
1464,"I love the halo because I don't want to have notifications of calls and messages. Nor do I need a clock and date on it. I have to agree with others though it is large on the wrist and does get uncomfortable. ALTHOUGH!  I put mine on my ankle, I didn't like the band so I took some stretchy fabric and sewed my own band cover. I love it.",4
1465,I love this thing! I think my favorite thing about it is the sleep tracker. its interesting to see the different sleep phases. the app has so many helpful things to create better life habits. its great!,4
1466,"This tool is really great for monitoring your daily activity levels as well as other beneficial components of overall health. The fat tissue measuring component is also really cool and paints a much better picture than typical devices.I did have an issue with the back portion of the device having a piece come unglued. But, it was quickly resolved and replaced. Looking forward to the future with this device.Coach Reggie",4
1467,"I love the sleep portion of the app.  However, this is not made for a senior  who is limited in mobility.  It would be great for the young athletic person.  I am sure this app would give me a zero if it could on the activity part.  It does not give much credit for step count just how many hours a person is moving.  Those of us who are older spend more time in the sedentary mode due sometimes to physical limitation, such as a hip that needs to be replaced.",3
1468,"I have been using this now for ~3 months and I can say there is a LOT about the app I enjoy. That being said, nearly all of the data displayed is fed via HR tracking and it's widely inaccurate.  I cannot tell you how many workouts I have done, rowing, kettle bells, resistance, etc, and my heart is racing but the app says my HR is sub 120 BPM. Now I am hardly a fitness expert but I can confidently say I know the difference between 150+ and 120 BPM.Unfortunately due to this the app becomes of marginal use. I am working with Amazon support for a replacement. Until this is properly resolved I cannot recommend this product.Update: after talking with support they recommended a factory reset. This will be the first device I have ever had to do that to before the 3rd month of ownership. When I told them I would rather pursue a return since their device software cannot handle extended use without their software losing it's ability to function they closed the support chat. Guess a return it is. DO NOT buy. And Amazon support, thanks for your help? I think?",1
1469,"The product worked fine, but on both that i have ordered the band no longer attaches.  It took less then 6 months for it to fall apart, and replacements cost about 1/3 of the product.  I would not order if i knew the band was going to be worthless in less than 6 months.It is a shame, the electronics work as expected when the band doesn't fall off, but if it won't stay on my wrist that does me no good.",3
1470,"Unfortunately, the sleep tracking was not consistent. It would record no ""sleep record""  for some nights.Also, I think the awakening component is too sensitive. I just move a lot when I sleep but I don't wake up. It will always record it as ""awake"" thus affecting my sleep efficiency",4
1471,"I don't love this product as much as I had hoped to. The sleep tracking would be fine, if it added naps in to the daily total. Voice was good but drained battery too fast, so I have that off right now. Unfortunately, that was my main reason for wanting it in the first place. My biggest complaint is with the charger. I have to wiggle it around, and press it down in various places to get it to start charging. I expect d better from Amazon than that.",3
1472,"This thing is pretty gimmicky. I had two samsung gear watches prior to this and it is not a suitable replacement if you are used to using a smart watch.The contact where the sensor meets your wrist needs to be more curved. It sits off your wrist quite a bit and can get uncomfortable after a night's sleep.The wrist band looks nice, but the band itself is small and my wrists are tiny. Almost have to completely take to out of the fastener to get it over my hand, which I don't like. But once you do get it on is easy to secure with your other hand.The speech monitoring is laughable, it give you vague periods of certain tones heard though out the day such as 'gratitude' etc. I do have a stressful job and have had severe bouts of frustration while wearing the device it never even mentioned.The exercise/step tracker is useless to me. It has no display and no way to remind to get up and stretch/walk which I found more useful on my other devices.I found the app pretty minimal. All and all I am not super excited to use it as it does not fill my needs.I got this device from an early testers promo at reduced price $27. Which I thought was worth the gamble considering how expensive a new gear watch will be. I ultimately will just be eventually getting another new gear watch.",1
1473,"It works most of the time for my exercise tracking. Unlike some of the other reviews I found it to be pretty accurate, aligns with with my Google fit tracker pretty well.. sleep tracking does seem a little buggy at times and the mobile app is very buggy. Oftentimes it won't connect or I have to reset the band or reinstall the app before it reconnects and actually shows anything new. Software is hard.",3
1474,"The item fits pretty well as it's adjustable and you tend to forget you have it on until it alerts you of a low battery. The sleep feature and activity stats are my favorite parts of this watch band. All information is in a app with this not having a screen. I prefer this anyway.The information is great, everything from heart rate, sleep monitoring and body temperature. There is a body scanning Feature which I use. It's a bit surprising to see my body fat % to be much higher than I expected. I'm not sure how accurate that is since I don't have any other way of measuring my BF%Overall a good fitness tracker. I haven't used this tone analyzer yet but I'll update my review when I do.",5
1475,"Fits perfectly and so easy to use. Setting it up was extremely easy, my 8 year old nephew helped me hahaha. I love how lightweight it is, I almost forget it’s there. I do love it’s mood tracking feature, haven’t had a device that has done that before. My only complaint is that it doesn’t have a GPS feature. Other than that, it’s helpful and accurate in tracking my overall health and fitness.",4
1476,"I LOVE fitness bands and was excited to try this one. Unfortunately it doesn’t rank high on my list. The band itself is plain and nondescript, which I liked. However there’s not a screen, no vibrations or even lights to help you know where you’re at with your daily goals. Setting up the band can be a little time consuming and my iphone (I’ve recently upgraded so had to set up a new profile) doesn’t easily connect to its bluetooth. The app is fairly basic. The only interesting part is the body scan, which is essentially a photo that is turned black and white, doesn’t tell you anything more than what you could find by using your height and weight online. I’ve gained weight since buying this band, obviously it didn’t shove the food in my face LOL, but it’s not help me be motivated or keep me on track since its not as easy to see where “I am” fitness wise. It has potential though so wait for a few updates and then try it out.",2
1477,"The Halo is an excellent device and I have no complaints about the operation or functionality of the device or app. The only issue I have with it, which makes it unusable for me, is that after wearing it for 3 - 4 days or so, I begin to experience intense itching and redness to my skin where the device (not the band) makes contact. I then have to stop wearing it for a day or two for relief. Once I put it back on, the cycle repeats. I have worn Apple Watches and Fitbits for years without such issues.",3
1478,"Value for money, sometimes the app doesn’t work though. Overall satisfied. Wide range of fitness videos which is the best part. The app and the band helped me a lot to get back into shape.",5
1479,"I like the skin tone color, data compared to peers. Does not sync to WW effectively, wish it would pull in data from Peloton.",5
1480,"I am using the tracker as an all around activity and sleep tracker. I am very impressed with the halo, and so is my Sleep Physician. It is the only one so far to accurately track the stages of sleep for a person over 60 and under 80 (very small amounts of deep sleep, with more Light sleep and a good amount of REM sleep). The other sleep trackers show lots of deep sleep, which is inaccurate for a person my age (6 slee studies over the last 10 years due to obstructive sleep apnea, CNS sleep apnea and narcolepsy. I love the fact that it is not a watch. Just a bracelet, as I still use my Apple Watch - aka Baby Boomer Life Alert, for the phone and email communications.",5
1481,"Sleep tracking is great.Also keeps track of your steps, heart rate, and has great exercise videos and recipes.",5
1482,"Unfortunately, the halo fell short due to skin irritation and it stopped syncing with my device and the double tap the button instruction did nothing to rectify the problem. This is the first device to cause this issue for me and I've worn fitness trackers for over 12 years.I also found the charger design difficult (or at least not super simple as it should have been) to situate the device to trigger charging.I love the body comp feature.",3
1483,The app should have more of a tutorial. I don’t understand the program things fully and I don’t know what’s part of the membership or not cause I would like to know what I’d have to pay once the free 6 months is up. It tracks your sleep fairly well and the steps are accurate. I do wish the tone thing would be in more detail,4
1484,"Just a hyped up Apple Watch but with less function. If your on a budget and can’t afford an Apple Watch, it’s an awesome replacement.Update after a few months of owning it. The band has basically become just a talking point in conversation, I really don’t open the app anymore. THE CHARGER ugh the charger I can not say enough about the charger. My band stop charging because the way it was designed it doesn't sit in there correctly. I have placed my band allot of times on the charger and come to find out my band never charged.",3
1485,"I returned this device.  I am a woman with small wrists and this wasn’t designed for me.. even though I ordered small, that is only the strap size. The electronic tracker part was almost as wide as my wrist, and hurt and actually bruised me during sleep.  I did have to fight with it, to get it set up and connected to my app, however once that struggle was over the app was easy to use and follow.  I hope down the road, they make improvements on design and perhaps I’ll try again.  No screen didn't bother me",3
1486,"I like how this product tracks my heart rate, activity and sleep.  I haven't used it to its full potential yet.  I'm extremely frustrated with the fact that it loose its connection and I have to constantly pair it again with my iphone.  I have not been able to find anything helpful on why this is occurring.  I'm on the fence if I would purchase this again at the $100 price point because I am losing my history.",3
1487,"So far it isn’t the best, but didn’t expect too much seeing that it is fairly new. I have had my halo on the charger for about 4 hours and it still isn’t fully charged. That’s one thing I am not impressed with- the size isn’t bad, wish it had more features to connect with. Still on the fence about it, but will give it another week before I decide to return.",4
1488,"I got the halo band in June 2021. The band dies, I hold the button down for the 15 seconds to restart it and half the time it does not restart. It’s been a very frustrating experience! When it works, it’s great. but it only contact you when there is 10% left on the band, and if you missed that tiny 15 second pop-up notification on your phone, you have no idea and walk around with a dead for hours or a day or two until you remember to check the app. And then once I charge it, it doesn’t always come back online. My husband has had better luck with the halo view, but he’s only had it since Christmas, so time will tell",2
1489,I had purchased the halo in Sept of 2021. I always liked the device and had no issues with it. Until this morning. I was wondering why this normally comfortable band was suddenly painful. When j went to readjust it I realized the back had somehow burnt off and burned me. Amazon only gives me the option to refund or replace- but at this point I’m not sure I want to replace. Also wouldn’t they like to know their product can do this?,2
1490,"The voice recognition is really unhelpful and pointless. The microphone on mine stopped working after 3 or 4 months, which is fine because all it did was say “you sounded anxious and unsure” or “you sounded excited.”The meditations from the Mindspace App are limited. You don’t get unlimited access to their library. I was going through a four week daily program and it was just the first week repeated 4 times. What’s there is ok, but some programs are ridiculous. “Take a 10 minute walk everyday” all you do is click yes or no when it asks if you walked that day. I’m pretty sure you don’t need an app for that.I didn’t use the exercise parts helpful but that wasn’t of interest to me.The sleep tracker is interesting but I question it’s accuracy.I got this on a pre-release promo sale. I wouldn’t buy one again.",2
1491,"This product is a complete disappointment.  It doesn't measure heart beat accurately during exercise.  The excuse given is the muscle throws off measurement by 'tensing'.  So how do you exercise without tensing muscles?  This device is poor in comparison to others (Apple Watch and Fitbit) that I have tried.  I don't particularly care for being tethered to a phone to see results or timings.  Having to wear the device on the dominate hand leads to issues as well.  This device was not well thought out.  And the 'tone' feature drains the battery 300% faster than when it is disabled.  What has tone got to do with fitness?  I would not recommend this device to anyone.  Save your money for something better, it won't be hard to find.Update: 30 days later the charger stops working.  No particular reason visible, apparently the poor quality of the product is affecting every part of the product.  I did receive a call right away after posting this review but the net result was no action taken to right the situation.  The canned written responses are insulting.  I would adamantly recommend avoiding this product and likely the second generation just announced.  Poor quality, no support and inferior to other products.",1
1492,"I used this product for 3 weeks and here are my take aways... 1. The tone tracker doesn't work unless you have bluetooth turned on, which will drain your phone battery crazy fast. Also the tone tracker perceives singing as being angry, even if you're not into heavy metal lol. 2. The points for fitness are very skewed. I lift weights and could barely meet the recommended 150 weekly points. I got more points for leisurely grocery shopping for 40 minutes than for 40 minutes of abs and leg lifting to muscle failure. Seriously. 3. The sleep feature is actually pretty cool, but I don't have problems sleeping so aside from it being neat to see how much REM I got, I don't actually need this feature.I don't have much to say about the body composition tracker. Its okay. I didn't use many of the labs. I feel that a food or calorie counter would be a valuable asset to accompany the points tracker (if they can fix it because right now is horribly inaccurate).",2
1493,"Great device, great app. I would recommend to people to invest in the Halo. The only hitch is that after a week of use the battery life diminishes greatly. Doesn’t hold a charge to last the whole day. Especially if you are planning to track your sleep as well as fitness.",4
1494,Has anyone had a problem with a weird rash from wearing the halo band?,4
1495,"The Halo has truly helped me over the past couple of months to learn my sleep pattern, what triggers my anxiety, and helps to control how I speak to people. I have noticed that the voice recognition only picks up every few hours, which can be frustrating when you are wearing it for a specific reason. The sleep tracker is phenomenal as it has helped with with doctor's appointments to get my sleeping issues under control. The app is sometimes hard to update and you have to give it a few minutes. The only downfall I have had from the Halo is when I wear it for long periods of time it leaves a dry skin patch/red mark on my wrist where the monitor sits. Otherwise 10/10!!!",5
1496,"This is a really nice product, except it needs a screen. I really love how it tracks my sleep patterns and gives suggestions. I just couldn’t stand wearing the halo and my fitbit. I wish they could be combined some how. Its too bulky to wear both. I decided to return it :(",4
1497,"The overall fit and feel of the band are good.  Tracking features for activity and sleep have been used primarily so far and have worked without issue.  Haven't used the BMI feature yet and plan to play around with the voice more before making up my mind on those features.  Batter life is decent if you have voice off but once enabled, the battery drains pretty fast.  Have Apple watch and while I don't miss all the extra apps showing up on a screen, I do really (really) miss not even having the time display on the band.",3
1498,"I was on a wait list for the Amazon Halo and when I finally got it,  I could not have been more happy! I'm obsessed. It is so comfortable to wear everyday and every night to bed.  I've always been curious about my sleep habits, if I'm really getting good sleep or not.... now I know.  Keeps me aware of my heartbeat...absolutely appreciate that!But my number one reason for loving my Halo is...it tells me about the tone of my voice! It's so on point. I'm always misunderstood because of being a introvert, shy, awkward, and sometimes just plain silly. It helps me see how people hear how I'm saying things. Such a great tool to have in my life. I'm so thankful for this product.",5
1499,Super helpful and amazing tracking,5
1500,"I LOVE this - I didn't need a watch face, so that part is great.  It fits my wrist comfortably, I can sleep wearing it which I could not do with my previous tracker.  The software on the phone it really easy to use, and the point system it uses to track fitness works really well for me.  I HATED tracking steps only, because I tend to take fewer steps, but work out in other ways.  BY tracking my intensity levels, I get a much more accurate view of what i'm doing.  And the different partners you can try out are crazy cool.  The meditation, yoga, various workouts are all easy to use and find one which can fit your schedule.",5
1501,Great tech and very informative. It may be too much reality for some as it does a visual avatar of your body and it evaluated your mobility. I can see doctors using it to evaluate their patients progress on stretching and physical therapy. Many recipes for healthy meals and some rockin workout. Only wish is had a time piece.,3
1502,"I used to use the Nike Fuel Band, which, in hindsight was a fitness watch too ahead of it's time and eventually failed. Anyway, the points system for exercise is EXCELLENT for people who want to track more than just steps, but intensity of activities. It's also much more motivational.The few hangups I have with the app is#1 you can't set a personal points goal... It just sets it for you and if you exceed it, it ups it.#2 it's hard to just look at your heart rate history. You have to go into activity... Then go to heart rate. I wish I could just look at my heart rate over the day without so many clicks.Still worth 5 stars in my opinion though!",5
1503,"I had stopped using my Halo during covid, and then it wouldn’t hold a charge when I tried to charge it. BUT Amazon exchanged it for a refurbished one, so now I have a Halo that works!😊😊😊",4
1504,"Very disappointed that the tracking capability was downgraded when the 'free' subscription expired. I don't need all the extra subscription stuff, but I didn't expect it to become less effective. Don't feel I should pay every month for what I actually bought if for, and that was the tracking capabilities. Think I'll go back to my Fitbit.",2
1505,"I have used every tracker you can imagine and was SUPER excited for this one. I was really disappointed with many things:1) Confusing UI - impossible to search things, you can't do a ""one-off"" meditation/workout/etc without adding it as a program, but you can only have a specific # of programs so you have to go back, remove a program, then try to find what you wanted, add it, find out it sucks, rinse, repeat.2) The ""science"" - there are what seem to be placeholder descriptions for each program - with zero useful information.3) Implementation - ok, I have the data, now what? The insights are just data dumps, with no actual utility or insights.4) Accuracy - so they say BMI is a farce, so bring in the body scan! Which says I'm nearly OFF THE CHARTS obese - as a 5'5"" 125lb person. Obviously, this made me really disappointed and felt even worse about myself. I kicked my ass with workouts and did the followup scan... even worse results.Basically, this appears to be a poorly designed beta test or something because it has no real utility or advice for change, does nothing new to analyze data from other trackers, and is overall clunky and basic.",1
1506,Its great! I just wish you could look back at the history of say your sleep to make comparisons. I still wish there was a way to put in a weight history too and an activity history. I've been very ill this fall and winter so in all fairness I have not been able to use all the extra features and labs. Its unfortunate but it is what it is.,4
1507,"HALO worked fine for 1 year + 1 mos.  Just stopped recording data.  Technical support was absolutely worthless.  I called twice and went thru the same trouble shooting steps I had Googled.  Both reps ended up hanging up on me under the guise of transferring me.  I had a chat with 7 reps.....each one would transfer me ""up"" to another rep, only to go through the same steps.  They are obviously working off of a script, but don't have any real technical knowledge of the product.  In the end.....there was nothing they could do but offer a 30% discount on a new one.  Same business model as Fitbit but at least Fitbit has a better reputation for their products.  Go with Fitbit.",2
1508,"I've given Halo 10 months - I'm not renewing my subscription.*pros - lightweight, bands are comfortable, app is easy to use, loved the extra access to different fitness, sleep and nutrition partner apps.*cons - the device itself gave out before it was even a year old, would constantly unsync with the App, heart rate monitor was not accurate, left a strange rash/burn on my wrist where I wore it (yes, I was able to put two fingers under the band per the manual) poor customer service as I couldn't even reach anyone to troubleshoot the device.I'm truly sad this device didn't turn out to be better than any of the others. I love the idea of tracking heart rate and improving that aspect of my health instead of being obsessed with calories and steps. Bummer :/",2
1509,I had to charge it to fast the time is to short.,5
1510,Awesome choice for fitness tracking.  The value is in the software aka app.  If you going with this tracker go with the black one.  Will not show any dirt or wear and tear.  Best money spent you will love this.  Only minus heart rate is battery killer and for that I do use much.  5-6 days is what I am experiencing between charges.,4
1511,"The UI is pretty nice, and the band is comfortable. If you are looking for a less-expensive version of WHOOP band, it is good. Very accurate activity tracking",4
1512,"I do not wear a watch or need one so I thought this tracker would be perfect. It looks sleep and small when I signed up for the pre-order. When it came the first thing I realized is that is hold have ordered a large. Even though it fits it is hard to take off and put on. I leave it on until it needs to charge, this is not terrible unless I am using the speech analyzer. The charger is also not the best and hard to line up.I like that I can leave it on for days and not worry about showering with it. The sleep tracker is also very nice and seems more accurate than the one built into my bed.Sadly this is where the positives end. This thing is not small and sleek. It is like a block on your wrist and very uncomfortable. I have stopped wearing it during the day because it starts to actually hurt. I see that another reviewer has the same issue. You either have to strap it too tight or leave it too lose and it slides around.My old fitbit was much better and more comfortable.I wish this would last longer for the battery and also that it was smaller. I am sure the next generation will be leaps ahead. Until then I would not recommend this and will not be keeping it.Good try but a swing and a miss.",1
1513,I like pretty much everything about the app. Mainly what I use it for is to track movement.,5
1514,"I have been using Halo for a week. I was hoping Halo would track my sleep and help me with staying fit.Yesterday I got up and open the door and returned to bed and continued to sleep. When I checked my sleep track later, i noticed that Halo didn’t noticed me walking in the door. My wife has Fitbit and it catches even she opens her eyes in the bed.I’m so disappointed.  The sleep tracking is not accurate and so now it only has step tracking and hear rate. Maybe I should have gone with Fitbit",3
1515,"I highly recommend this Halo!!  After my review, customer service called and helped me work it out!!  I have not had an issue since!!  GET IT!! I was really digging this band, much more so than other trackers I had.  Then it stopped syncing with my Iphone.  So I did everything I was supposed to and it still would not work, so Amazon replaced it.  Again, works amazing when it works!!.  My second one had not synced for 9 days. I have tried everything to get it working again and the return window has closed.  I am super glad I got this for free through WW+ or I would be super upset!!",5
1516,Easy to use fitness tracker…comfortable to wear…does a great job tracking your fitness results,5
1517,"Everything is great except for the pedometer. I wore my fitbit and the halo today. It's 6pm and my halo says 3,000 steps and my fitbit is at 9,000 because they sell different bands and i can wear it on my ankle for an accurate reading. That's a heck of a difference. If you're not buying it for steps, it's fantastic. Much more comfortable than my large fitbit versa. Once they come out with ankle bands, I'll prefer it over my fitbit. For now though, while I'll wear both, I favor the versa. PLEASE COME OUT WITH MORE BANDS.",3
1518,"I have been enjoying this, I actually prefer wearing it over my Apple Watch 5. I only have to charge it roughly once every 5 days. I do wish it had a watch feature though. I also do not use the tone detector just for the fact I don’t want it listening to everything I say. The biggest disappointment is the pink band looks dirty, it was like this after a few days use. I wish new ones weren’t quite so much. The activity measurement and sleep detection seems to be accurate and I am overall impressed thus far.",3
1519,Nothing compelling. For an app dependent health band the app does nothing to get my attention. I’ve yet to receive a single notification and I’ve verified that notifications are enabled with full access on my iPhone. The sleep tracking is cool. The tone feature feels gimmicky right now. The best feature in my opinion is the body scan.The app is incredibly busy and seems more interested in bombarding me with getting me to use one of the partner services than actually helping me understand my health.If I don’t remember to get into the app then I will go days forgetting about if.  So right now it is just a strap I have on my wrist that mocks me because it doesn’t tell time.This is designed as nothing more than a health App Store. You pay a small monthly fee and your supposed to use the health partners features.Save your money. Better yet if you’re using Apple get an Apple Watch or get a Garmin or Fitbit.,2
1520,"I am so disappointed in this little band. I really like the features etc. However, today, I like several other users have experienced the ""won't charge"" problem. I've watched the troubleshooting video and read the online forums. I've tried everything everyone else did and no luck. I've owned this for just under 5 months and ALWAYS remove it before showering or water sports. The window for return passed 4 months ago and now I am left with a fitness band with only a 12% charge left and no way to turn it around. This doesn't make for a good way to spend $100. At this rate, it would cost about $300 per year to own one. Not good, Amazon. I'm rarely disappointed with one of your items, but this one seems like a real sucker trap. Also, the sleep tracking has been unreliable for a few days leading up to the refusal to charge",2
1521,"I am having to charge the band every couple of days. I purchased it because of the sleep tracker and the tone monitoring - and yes I understand that the tone monitoring would waste the battery life -  but it doesn't record any of the tones or conversations I have to let me know where I am - good thing I got it on prime day, because so far it is a waste of money.",3
1522,"Unfortunately I'm out of my return window... This device I though was great until I started to track my heart rate during work outs. It reads WAY below what is accurate. My apple watch was taking my heart rate at 150-160 and this one said I was barely breaking 100, which was def wrong based on my breathing! I will not be using the device anymore and I would return if possible. Heart rate tracking is a huge feature for me and to find out it doesn't work properly is a bummer.",3
1523,"FITNESS LABS/COACH/GUIDE: The fitness Labs of Halo are highly superior to those in Fitbit. Halo also has a much better variety of labs that guide you through more aspects of the wellness of your mind and body.TONE: Tone is a very useful tool. For those concerned about its battery use, it is easy to turn it on to capture the desired conversation and then turn it back off.BODY: I haven’t yet tried the Body feature (shy) but I will. It will be pleasing to get such a detailed visual on how I’m progressing. A scale only gives weight, but the Body feature will show the reduction and refining of my shape as I trade fat for muscle.",5
1524,"I've had this for about 4 months, and the bpm don't seem to be accurate!  There are many times that my heart feels like it's beating out of my chest and breathing hard, but my bpm doesn't get over 130 bpm, which is very hard to believe!  I do not use the tone feature as it drains the battery very quickly.  Took me at least 2 weeks to get use to it digging into my wrist.  I don't wear watches, so I just think it's something new for me to get use to.Big indent on my wrist when I do take it off!  I've only used the body scan once, and I do like that feature and would possibly keep using that in the future.  Still debating if this band is worth it.  The sleep monitoring seems to be mostly accurate, but there are nights that are disputable.  Overall it's an ok product, but wish the bpm was more accurate!",2
1525,"I like the look of the halo, and it’s more comfortable than a fitness watch, but it’s not accurate. I just finished a 2.5 mile walk, and the activity tracker says i walked 770 steps — it should be closer to 4,000-5,000 steps! Same with the sleep tracker. I’ll lay down at 10:00, and the tracker will say i fell asleep in 1 minute at 10:30. It’s just too far off and disappointing.",2
1526,"I like this product a lot.One big disappointment, syncing to phone.  Too often, I am asked to double-tap the watch to sync.  And asked again, and again,....you get the point.Also, why does the watch have to have cell service in order to provide step count, etc.  That just does not make any sense.Last part - heart beat data would be real nice to see a graph.",3
1527,"So I bought my amazon halo when I saw how it tracks sleep, which I was deprived from after covid PTSD, but once I learned how it tracks your daily health and activity I was even more curious since health is my passion. I was nervous bc I read one bad review and noticed that it didnt have as many stars as I'd expect, but I decided to trust one good review and now I'm hooked. The bracelet does exactly what it advertises. Every feature is very functional and then some. My boyfriend thinks its freaky thought it can recognize your mood, but since I'm no special agent with major secrets, I thinks its pretty fascinating!",5
1528,I love this fitness band except I am unable to wear it for long periods of time and can not sleep with it every night. I was so disappointed when my wrist broke out after 4 days of continuously  wearing the band. I will be cancelling my membership. I wish the makers had thought about the materials as nickel allergy is very common.,3
1529,I like being able to track sleep and my exercise progress.  Getting notifications for my heart rate.  I enjoy my Halo band.,5
1530,"This item is more about a mobile app than about the actual usefulness of the item.  The band itself monitored heart rate very well, but its other functions were no where near us useful.  The voice recognition didn't work at all and the sleep app thought I was in bed around two hours before I actually went to bed.  I had high hopes for the band but was disappointed.",3
1531,"As someone who has an Apple Watch, I found this tracker serviceable for sleep tracking but prefer the Apple Watch. The voice recognition was interesting but I don’t know what value there is in it. I wanted to like it but after a few months one day I realized it was sitting in the charger and I had not put it on in 3 days. The app has some interesting features for playing sounds to go to sleep to, this was by far the most useful of the features.",3
1532,"I got the halo band for early access and I've had it for about 7-8 months now. There were times where I wish I had gotten a Fitbit instead, but over time more features came out and it got better.What I think is ridiculous is that you have to pay $3.99 a month to use most of the features. I didn't want to do that so I cancelled my membership to their service and decided I would just use the free version. Turns out, the free version is the barest of bare minimum - so I decided I'd pay the $3.99 for now.Turns out, it's IMPOSSIBLE to resume your subscription after cancelling it for some reason. I talked to Amazon customer service for 45 minutes and they couldn't help me renew my subscription. They were absolutely clueless. After 45 minutes they wanted to transfer me to the video team. I told them I was done and it shouldnt be this hard to renew a subscription.Overall, it was an okay band/ app but there are way too many kinks that need to be worked out. Spend the few extra dollars and get a Fitbit instead. I wish I could get back what I paid for the Halo Band after the time I just wasted trying to renew my membership.",1
1533,"I’ve had the Halo since it first became available. From sleep, exercise and eating, the app has great information.",5
1534,"I liked that it counts steps, measures heart rate, analyzes voice, the first few weeks when it was working it got me pretty focused on being healthier.Dislikes: After a few weeks it started crashing whenever I spent more than 2-30 seconds in the app so I really can't access that data it supposedly is collecting.Not sure: I kind of like that it doesn't have a clock, but even after weeks of using find myself checking it to see what time it is since there's something on my wrist that feels like a watch.",3
1535,The tone analysis is okay. Battery life is good. Sleek industrial design akin to duct tape on wrist (I got the onyx color). Not finding much utility in the app. There is content but not presented in a way to get me to use it.,3
1536,The app works well and is easy to navigate. The halo does give a lot of false sleep and step results. Usually if I wake up in the middle of the night and I check my steps I’ll be at 200+ steps in my sleep!  The voice recognition feature is pretty cool and helps me work on my tone and attitude. I do like the alerts it gives when the battery is fully charged or very low. The heart rate feature is also very useful and has a quick response rate.,3
1537,"Pros:- accuracy seems mostly on point- I appreciate a distraction free band- fits large wrists- the app is pretty user friendlyCons- really quite useless as a “fitness” band- collects a lot of information and doesn’t convert it into- not convenient for tracking workouts and activitiesWish list- integration with other apps- track all sleep, including naps- more robust tracking altogether (stairs, menstrual cycles, etc)All in all, if you’re going to be this amazing health band, you should probably live up to that.",3
1538,"I’ve had the Halo band since May, I have had more than my share of issues with it, not tracking my workouts every time, sometimes says it’s reading my heartbeat in the live tracker then no points with a moderate workout.I have Standing desk at work, listening to music, again heart rate says moderate, but getting sedentary time off..Moving away from Halo when my year membership is up.Would not recommend.",3
1539,"I was so excited when I received it. My first Fitbit like item. Bought to motivate me and it did for a while. But if course we as humans can't be consistent all the time. So I placed it in a cool dry area. And now that I want to use it, it's no longer charging. How do I return this?",3
1540,"This was a bit tight with just the fabric band, as other users mentioned, and it pushed against the wrist bone too much. However, if you also purchase a spot band and switch to that, the band doesn't sit so flush against your body, and alleviates some of the pressure.",4
1541,"Unfortunately ,for me the Halo Band did not work well. I did not like having to check the app to see where my steps were at. I constantly had to refresh. I like the scan feature but did not set up the voice.  I went back to Vera Fitbit because I could easily see where I am at.  There was nothing wrong with Halo it was more personal preference.",3
1542,"For what it does, this device is pretty good. It combines your body’s movement with heart rate to calculate activity points, which makes perfect sense to do. I also really like the fact that it has no screen and you have to use the App to check your stats and points—this way I don’t obsess over my heart rate and activity points and can focus on the workout that I am doing.I only really use this to measure my workouts and BMI, but I really like this little device. The only other thing that I wish it could do is track my body’s temperature.Overall, it does what it says.",5
1543,"I really liked the Halo at first.  The app is great, there's a lot of features I really like. But I've had to factory reset it multiple times. It's glitchy and just randomly decides not to work, which is really unfortunate. Lasted about 6 months in total.",4
1544,I am still exploring halo and it’s abilities. I find that the activity tracker helps keep me motivated and striving to do better than the day before.,4
1545,"I absolutely love this band.  Reading the negative and low star reviews is quite hilarious!  I am so glad I got this over an Apple Watch.  The fact that I'm not interrupted with constant pings on a screen is by far one of the best features.  It's super comfortable, I wear it all day and night.  Love the rose gold tone that allows me to dress up the look.  The sleep tracking is SPOT on.  The avatar image is so unique, and the tone tracking is wild!  This band has definitely helped me get on track in many ways.  Love all the workout programs that are accessible, there's a wide variety to select from.  I highly recommend this band!",5
1546,"I was hoping that this device would sync with MyFitnessPal application because I am using that to track my calorie intake and the Halo to track my steps, etc. Many other devices do sync with MyFitnessPal so I'm hoping Halo will do the same very soon. Right now I have to convert my steps to MyFitnessPal manually and the two descriptions don't always matchup. I like seeing my heart rate and how my sleep patterns are developing, letting me make adjustments to my habits. I just feel it could do more.",3
1547,"Just returned my second Halo band.  Worked great, even preferred it to the Whoop strap, but just kept breaking.  If I let the battery go all the way dead (which happens when there's no warning buzz/light), I would have to do a purple LED reset and reconnect to the app everytime.  3-4 times in it just stops pairing or charging altogether.",2
1548,"I love the tone of voice feature. It's not just positive or negative or neutral, it's descriptive with variable words. I appreciate that the exertion is measured for exercise, not just steps. I use the sleep programs almost every night. Works like a champ. My only complaint is that now there's nowhere for a watch.",4
1549,"This is a rather new product so it isn’t perfect.  I really like the sleep tracker, but it will think that you are asleep if you’re reading or watching television so your accuracy is thrown off.  It would also be nice if you could track a nap by having a sleep tracker reset feature.  The app works pretty well, but it resets your sleep pattern if you open it to check the charge.  The voice tracker is hilarious because I get almost all frowny faces because my Mother is very hard of hearing so you have to speak very loudly.  I have not tried the body feature yet, but I will when I get the courage to see how much it has changed since I was disabled while I was in the Army.  Last, I really like the fact that it looks like a bracelet, even though the sizes are wrong, since it does not have a watch face like so many other devices have.  All in all a good start.Amendment:  unfortunately, my original version of the Halo died in stages soon after I wrote the original review with the voice tracker going first and ending with the sleep tracker even though I immediately purchased the subscription, which was refunded.  As a result, I sadly had to reduce the rating to 1-star from 4-stars.  Hopefully, Amazon corrected its quality control with this version.",1
1550,"Positive - not bad looking and comfortable to wear.Negative -(1) fails to ""count"" 30-50% of my steps.  The Fitbits I've had were within a few steps of a pedometer reading.(2) changes the sleep reading -- different in the morning after getting up than in the evening.Today was 70 when synched on rising.....a few minutes ago was reading 74...and now says 73.What the heck? I just checked the graph --  I was up by 8:30, and it shows me sleeping until 10:24!!!>Yesterday my sleep read at 80...by the end of the day, it was down to 61 -- apparently my heart rate was low, but it showed activity -- still in sleep mode, and then ""sleep"" when I was sitting for two hours (playing on the Kindle and watching a movie).",2
1551,I have issues with sleeping and this really helped me put things in perspective in how good my sleep actually wa,5
1552,"Really impressed with every aspect, from the body image to the activity points system to the tone tracking.",5
1553,"The step counter is very inaccurate, I've had to fully set up the watch multiple time on the app which is very annoying to do. Battery life is good but that's probably its best quality, as far as a fitness watch you're probably better of just getting some else.",2
1554,"The Halo device had one feature that kept me wearing it, despite its questionable accuracy. That was asleep reporting.However, when the free subscription ends, to pay four dollars a month to be able to continue to get any meaningful benefit from this product is ludicrous.There are far too many other better options out there that don’t cost $50 Per year, to use what you have already purchased.",3
1555,"I wasn't a fan. Bought it when they first released it, and used it for a while to give it a chance. The fabric band gets so dirty so easily and doesn't come clean. I didn't like that it doesn't give you any information on the band itself. The sleep tracking didn't seem accurate at all. It would read that I was awake for way longer than I was through the night. It doesn't link up with myfitnesspal... Idk. Maybe I was expecting more from this band. It just wasn't what I wanted.",3
1556,"It's really disappointing that this product has such low ratings because people are uncomfortable with accurate results being ""demotivating"" it's honest. And I need that. I don't need a tracker thar gives me recommendations based on trying to make me feel good about myself. I just got this today and so far I'm very impressed by the features it has. It has recorded my range of motion and my body fat percentage. And apparently it's more accurate than my smart scale which was recording my body fat percentage to be 10 percent less which is a huge difference. Such a cool device. Don't listen to the negative reviews",5
1557,"Have had this problem for over a year, where it detects high amount of exercise fine, but light exercise, even for over 30 minutes next to nothing, like a reading of one.  Many Amazon techs have worked on the problem and none have been able to solve the problem.  Have also sent new or refurbished bands and those did not solve it either.  Again this has been going on for well over a year.  My original band worked fine but lasted less than a year.  The only area the techs were able to improve was the sleep tracking.  I was one of the original people that got the band and i liked it at first before all the problems started.  Need help from someone who is knowledgeable",2
1558,"Had it for 4 months, the sensor fell out today. Never got it wet (was too scared) other than sweat, and cleaned/dried it daily. Sensor still fell out, smh. Charging has been hit or miss but always takes a while to get it right. Lastly I dont think I benefited whatsoever since I had to access the app to get any information on my progress throughout the day, as a nurse I barely remember to eat, much less check the Halo App.",3
1559,"The band can not detect bicycle rides for me, so far detected only one out of 4 (as generic activity).Sleep pattern works better, but It often doesn't detect naps after nigh sleep, even you go to bed for another couple of hours.Not going to use the voice function or body imaging for the privacy reasons.The app is full of filer features, to make the offering look more solid, but there is nothing unique about it. Not worth the subscription.The low price (when it was $60) was the main advantage.",3
1560,"Sleep- Fitbit tells me my sleep score was 85 which is great.  Halo tells me it was 35 which is bad.Activity- As for WW fitpoints using the halo I get 4 fitpoints, using FITBIT I get 14 fitpoints for the same activity. The step count is within 100 steps.Will keep both on for the week.The body imaging software is depressing, calculates body fat 6% higher than FITBIT.",3
1561,"Tone does not track at all. Tried resetting everything as support team suggested. My working space where I have meetings is a silent room, I wear short sleeves so  nothing blocks the mic, pushed the bookmark button to start listened, sync with calendar as well but still consistently does not pick up anything. This was a selling point for me so very disayppointed that the feature that sold me proved non existent.Sleep function also doesn't not pick up naps only good for long periods of sleep over night. Now that my sleep patterns and length changed because of a new born baby. Sleep function is not helpful anymore.The app UI is not bad but because the device does not push tone or sleep data the app isn't useless.",2
1562,I wish this item could have a better way at charging as sometimes it doesn’t exactly charge right. I love some of the features but for the price it is a bit to high for what it is. Overall I love what this has to offer and a great way of measuring yourself in regards to your voice and sleep tracking.,4
1563,"Charger defective, app could be much friendlier , I didn’t turn voice recognition on since many said it drains the battery , if it doesn’t sit in the charger just so it doesn’t charge . All in all not bad for a first generation but being an Amazon product I expected more . Would be nice if it tracked your hydration.",3
1564,The Amazon Halo is cool idea and has some fun new feature but ultimately I think they are unnecessary. I like that it's doesn't have a watch face and that it has the point system to keep you motivated. I don't really need all the added bells and whistles of a voice tracker and an in-depth sleep scale. I was actually going to return it a couple of weeks ago but just missed the return period. I think their are other products that better for my needs.,3
1565,I like the size though not having the time is frustrating as I always try to look at it!! I just cannot get over the battery life.  It is way too short for it to be of any use.  There is no screen and it barely lasts 1.5 days and conks out in the middle of the night.  I don't want to be tethered to a charger all the time.  I like the sleep tracking and it is accurate.  I find the tone for voice useless.  The bodyfat tracking is a bit scary.  It is all a personal choice whether ya want to take pics of yourself and upload them.  I find it creepy but again it seems to work and looks to be accurate.  Heartrate monitoring needs work.  Fairly useless.  I will give it more time.  BATTERY is the main issue and will likely annoy most people to stop using it.,2
1566,"The sleep tracking is pretty useful.  When I think I had a good night sleep and later in the day, I get tired and irritable, I check the app and it would show poor or fair sleep.  I just wish it connected to other fitness apps like MyFitnessPal.  So I know how much  I am consuming and how much I am burning.",4
1567,I like being able to track my sleep and my exercise. And it works great in the pool. The only problem I have with it is the band stays wet for awhile. I may need to get a different band that doesn’t absorb water so much.,4
1568,"I’ve had mine since December and today the face broke off the puck. It was perfectly fine all day and when I took it off to charge the glass plate just fell off. I'm seeing this in other reviews so hopefully I can get this taken care of.UPDATEwas able to finally get in touch with someone and they're sending me a replacement.  I'm very happy with this or my first fitness band, so I was really bummed when it broke. I haven't been able to use it for a month now, so I'm happy I'll be able to use it again soon.",5
1569,"I am surprised by how much I love this device, because I am not usually someone who has to have the newest gadget, and I am not at all athletic. The Halo is encouraging me to be more active on days that I haven’t accumulated a lot of points, and I think the sleep tracking has actually helped me sleep better. I am sleeping an average of one hour a night more than I used to, which is great. The battery lasts for a long time and the Halo is not very noticeable or cumbersome on my arm. I would recommend this device to anyone.",5
1570,"Google and you'll find I'm only one of many that experienced the Halo completely dying within/close to 90 days in. I honestly didn't like the Halo to begin with, I didn't realize how much LESS featured it was than my Fitbit Charge 2. But I did grow to like the activity points vs steps and the sleep tracker seemed to get more on point quickly (felt it was accurate within a couple of weeks).  And then, on day 89...dead. Sensor stopped working in the middle of the night. I looked for potential troubleshooting....and found many similar scenarios.I called customer service and honestly, the rep was helpful, but never offered a refund....but sorta was prompting me to ask for it...it was like she wanted me to ask for the refund vs replacement, but couldn't say the words. So move forward to I did ask for the refund and figured...Halo needs another year of DEVELOPMENT, 2 strong features does not compare to 6-8 good ones on Fitbit. So, I return my Halo, get my refund....AND THEY CHARGED RESTOCKING FEE!  BE WARE! BE WARE! BE WARE!I am an Amazon fan folks, and THIS is very disappointing and I will NOT be recommending without serious cautions....and I'll be calling customer service back or my bank....really?  Dang thing can't even hit 90 days?  (And supposed year warranty, what....with the next 90 days band?  Sheesh!)",1
1571,I’ve tried a lot of fitness trackers and I have to say this is my least favorite. With it being a new product I am giving it the benefit of doubt hoping they workout the kinks.I can’t get the body fat analysis to work on it. The charger is a nightmare... it seriously takes forever to get it lined up correctly and the stats on it aren’t accurate.I wore this along with my whoop and a heart rate monitor during an intense workout. The whoop and my heart rate monitor were identical however the halo fell so short.I have had a lot of skin irritation with this band but I do have sensitive skin so I can’t entirely blame the band. I also don’t like that you can’t get details about your workout or sleep.I was expecting an item more like the WHOOP but this let me down big time. I will however give it some more time in hopes it works appropriately.,2
1572,"The biggest problem is charging. The decision of charging port and charger means if you don’t perfectly align it you’re out for a day. I’ve had this happen maybe 10% of the time.It’s reasonably good otherwise. Low profile. Nothing mind blowing about it.It does seem like Amazon is about to start charging for some of the features, I got an email letting me know they “extended my trial”. There’s absolutely nothing about it worth paying an ongoing monthly fee. Zero.",3
1573,"For some reason the Halo simply will not reliably stay connected to the Halo app. I have to re-pair it frequently and it sets up like new each time. So, any metrics it’s gathered (which is the main reason I got it, things like sleep quality, resting heart rate, etc etc) all get lost when you have to set it up again.It’s just not quite where it should be. It’s promising, and I love the body composition aspect of it, but it falls short of what I would expect from an Amazon product.",3
1574,"...which makes it completely useless.  The Tone and Body Shape stuff are pretty useless too.  Seems to work well as a heart rate monitor, except that it produces data that can't be used due to not syncing to anything but WeightWatchers, which is $30/mo.  Save your money and buy something that isn't made and owned by the Death Star.",1
1575,"My favorite thing about the Halo is that it doesn't have a screen.  The last thing I need is another screen in my life and all the nagging attention demanding aspects thereof.  The Halo is chill and has a solid set of features.  I really like it and have already worn it longer than other wrist devices I've tried.  The Tone analysis is interesting and fairly useful although I leave it off most of the time due to batter usage, but when I visit family or have a work call I like to have it on.UPDATE:  After 1 Year of Daily Use----------------------------------------All was great until about a month ago when it stops showing charging status, then this weekend it stopped reading activity info, no live data, no recording of exercise... its dead.  So I loved it, then it died after using it for a single year.  That is why I changed it from 5 stars to 2 stars.",2
1576,"My Halo stopped tracking activity points after just a year (I.e., I go for a jog for 15 minutes and receive 0 points). I also never used the voice control as it didn’t seem accurate. Overall, I was impressed with the device’s performance until now.",3
1577,Use this mostly for sleep tracking. It is fantastic. Seems spot on with the various sleep stages.,5
1578,"It works! I purchased this item to help keep better track of my health and weight loss. You will need to work with it in order for it to work for you. That said, follow the set up with accuracy and honesty. For those of you that are scared about the data tracking, I would start with being more concerned about social media, your bank and cellphones.With that being said, this band operates off of a point system and live tracking. This has pushed me unintentionally to go harder with my workouts and burn more calories. I do not use it to track my sleeping.",5
1579,"I really want to like this band. First, the sleep tracker was wrong 70% of the time. Says I slept 4.5 hours when in fact it was 7+. On the weekly sleep tracker, it was always one day ahead, Fri was sat.  I emailed Amazon support, never heard back. I did like several features and I will say the offered many programs. Just ok overall",3
1580,"It’s a great first edition, however I am going to stick to my Apple Watch.  I worn both at the same time for most of the day for a month or so.  The band is a little bulky and the tone feature is nice, along with the sleep tracking; but I can not justify having this based on those two features alone.  When they come out with a version that can do all of these things and as the features of an Apple Watch I’ll consider getting one them.",3
1581,"purchased in Nov. 2020.  Last week I had this 'thing' dangling from my wrist - thought it was a bug - ended up being the back of the halo cover hanging by a string of 'glue'.  Pulled it off and even though it can be put back on (but constantly will fall off as you take the band on and off), it will not sync at all to the Halo app.  It is useless now.  Mind you, I stopped using it for a while and went back to my fibit.  Then decided to try it again so i didn't even wear it the entire 10 months.  Not worth it.  Plus it doesn't give you miles - only steps.  Not impressed at all.  Love the comfort and design but nothing more.",2
1582,"I've owned this for a month now, bought it to track my sleep. I wake up constantly because of my broken back and it keeps me awake for a long time. When it's time to get up I check my phone and it almost always says I slept great! I look at the sleep chart that shows what they think I slept and it never showed that I was awake for hours at a time. Last night I even got up at 3 am to check the house because I heard a noise, then laid in bed paranoid for an hour and it still didn't detect I was awake.",1
1583,"I’ve had the Amazon Halo for about a month now. I have owned an Apple Watch, various Fitbits, and a Jawbone so I’m very familiar with fitness trackers. The Halo has only 2 apps you can connect it to as of right now. As far as sleep tracking, it doesn’t do well, it doesn’t track naps and doesn’t give you details of levels of sleep. I need a fitness band to motivate me and this one “punishes” you for sedentary time by taking away points you’ve earned for activity, this is not motivational because you will never meet the preset goal of 150 points a week. The voice tone feature is pretty useless and sucks the battery. I would never upload pictures of my body to this for body fat tracking so I haven’t used that feature either. There’s no weight goal tracking, no food tracking. This band has a long way to go to catch up to Fitbit (which I prefer over Apple Watch for exercise tracking).",2
1584,"To start off, for most people this is fine. However it is both insufficient and counterproductive for me personally. I have lost a ton of weight (250+ Lbs) the body fat percentage tracker is way off for me. I am incredibly active, currently training for an Ironman and go to the gym 5 days a week.  Halo fails to provide as much insight to my performance as I would like. Sleep tracker works well and is the highlight in my opinion.Having tried Fitbit, halo, Apple Watch and Whoop I found that whoop covers all the bases and provides the most productive feedback and information for performance improvements that I am looking for. I am the weirdo who wears an Apple Watch and a Whoop strap because I like the none Fitness aspects of the Apple Watch (and compete with friends who wear one)If you are looking for basic info this Halo is fine; but considering the monthly subscription required I would recommend Whoop.",2
1585,"I have been using Halo for about a month now and so far I am LOVING it. There are only 2 things I would like to see improved with this.  One would be that I would love the option to start/stop a calorie counter to track how many calories are burned during my workouts. It tracks based on heart rate, but I would love the option to see how many cals for a specific period of time i.e. when I am at the gym. The only other ""complaint"", is that I take it off for about an hour or 2 max a day however, when I do that it seems to count against my sedentary time.Aside from those 2 things, so far so good.",5
1586,"I've had it for a couple weeks.  Activity and Sleep tracking are great.  The ""Tone"" voice monitoring is completely useless, and kills the battery.  For some reason it won't let you completely turn it off, so I minimized it's on time.  I haven't set up the ""Body"" feature yet.  My other complaint is the material the band is made out of gets dirty quickly.",3
1587,Not great for heart rate/activity tracking. The heart rate monitor works well when doing steady state cardio with little arm movement such as a bike or stair machine (only if you keep your hands on the handles). Anything  else causes it to be very erratic. I do regular 45 minute HIIT classes and it rarely registers my heart rate above 90 when I can barely breathe. Even when I’m weight lifting it will often not even track my heart rate.,3
1588,"I really wanted to like the Halo, but I don’t. The sleep tracking is the best part, but it’s scoring system is opaque. The heart rate monitor is usually off pretty dramatically. The app is fine, and the body fat measurement seems accurate. The tone analysis would be cool, but it gives you no context. So you’re like “oh, I was irritated at 3:12 pm. What was I doing then?” I like the sleep tracking, but there are better ways to get that without a subscription",3
1589,"This fitness tracker does a commendable job tracking sleep and activity... When it works. Voice recognition is sketchy. Sometimes it seems to work, while at other times it doesn't evaluate anything I say... And I literally talk for a living.All told, I want to really like this. It is nice to have a tracker that is just present without any distractions.The problem I have with this device is found in its failure to remain paired with the app. I'm not taking about Bluetooth pairing with the phone. Repeatedly, over and over again, I will open the app to look at my data and receive a message about the band having unpaired from the app. The solution is a factory reset in whichi lose days and nights worthy worth of data.I'm done with this junk. I'm going with a Charge 4.",2
1590,"I love the design of the tracker barely notice it on my wrist. The only dislike is the fabric band gets dirty easy and stays wet for a while, I will be trying the sports band. The activity tracker and break down of activity intensity through out the day keeps me motivated to keep moving. Highly recommend this tracker to anyone needing a little motivation!",4
1591,"There are some cool things about this thing, but the cool things are costly in battery power. This thing can't go 2 days without charging! It spends so much time on the charger that it defeats the purpose of a passive wearable device. I forget it and leave it in the charger. Should I really have to take steps just to remember to put on? Isn't the idea that it is passive? That's why there is no screen. Could you imagine how bad the battery life would be if there were a screen?",3
1592,"It is cool to get the data that amazon is offering, neat app too. But this device hurts after wearing it for prolonged periods. It actually feels like it is burning me, I've checked other reviews and it seems somewhat comment. Very common if people get it wet. I never got mine wet and it still gave me a burning sensation. The other thing is the charged, very poorly designed. It opens like a mouth and clamps  around the band to charge, but it doesnt seat correctly you have to learn how to put it on correctly, the right exact spot and then squeeze the charger around it. Fix the burn and give a convenient charger and it is probably 4 out 5 product.",1
1593,"Works well for monitoring sleep, activity and heart rate. When calling customer support, received good response.",5
1594,"Using the Halo to the fullest with the voice tracking makes the battery go faster than what they say. I have charged it about once a day. It does charge quickly which is nice, but daily charging is a bit much. I won’t charge it at bedtime because I like to track my sleep. I’m still trying to figure out how accurate it is.",4
1595,"I have an Apple Watch since they came out, upgrade each new series.  I have had fitbits since you clipped them to your waistband.  This halo is archaic, does nothing productive, hard to get on the charger and it connect properly...so many times I thought I had it connected and nope, dead as a door nail and had not charged at all.  Ridiculous if you use all the features it has to be charged daily...and you can’t charge it at night because that defeats the sleep tracking.  One of the sleep features is a story that goes on and on and on and on...who can fall asleep to that...then you finally get put out with the reader droning on and out and you shut that off and then it no longer tracks your sleep and starts you back over at day one!  WTF!  Of course Amazon won’t take it back and it’s worthless to donate because no one will want it, so mine went in the trash!  Save your money and buy an Apple Watch or a Fit Bit.  Even the 30.00 Chinese knock offs do more than the Halo and are remarkably accurate.  Designer of the Halo and all those on the project or approved it for consumer release need to be fired and they need to refund us all our money.  Just another horrible thing about 2020 - the Halo! Lol",1
1596,I find the device very helpful at tracking sleep and steps taken. I'll spend more time using it.,4
1597,"I appreciate that the Halo is not bulky like my Galaxy smart watch, which makes it more practical for using for sleep tracking. It is does not provide the interaction that I am used to with my smart watch. I am unsure of the value of the subscription, since these are predominantly work out routines. I don't need 100s of workouts. How about developing apps that use my biometrics to help me in other ways? Give suggestions not only to be active but to have other healthy habits.",3
1598,"I was drawn to the product because it is compact, unassuming (nearly invisible) and it checks all of the health stats I would need. I also have enjoyed the voice tone analysis feature. What sounds kind and understanding to me may not come across that way to others. Having this feature allows me to train myself to use different tones when talking with others. My favorite feature by far is the sleep analysis. If I want to see what the quality of my sleep was the night before, it will show me the sleep pattern, how often I was awake, and record the times of any disturbances.  Now I can make adjustments and get a better night's rest. Well worth the investment!",5
1599,I love the point system. It measures the intensity of your steps/workout!,5
1600,"Here’s the update to this piece of junk. Just changed back from an Android to an iPhone. Seems that the device is tied to just the Android and all the data from the last 6 months gets tossed out the window with no way to back up or carry over! Why am I paying a monthly fee? Does Amazon think phones never get upgraded?Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. You’re just throwing money away with this garbage. Id give the thing away but it would just screw the next person.Original review below.I'm trying to like this device and for the most part I do. Sleep tracking is horrendous though. I know I'm a horrible sleeper but a third of the time it won't track my sleep at all and the rest of the time it says I'm wide awake when that's not the case. I expect score s under 50, but a 5, 20 or just dashes? I'm properly wearing the band at night too. I even compared this to my polar A300 and it's a fraction of that score. Amazon needs to tweak this area like let me set when I'm going to sleep rather than just guessing between certain hours.Other than that it is really spot on accurate. Seems like a well built product and on average I charge on the 5th day. I don't use tone though.",1
1601,"I used this for a couple of weeks.  As far as bands go, it was okay.  The rather large device could get uncomfortable at times.  I slept with it a few times and seems fairly accurate.  I loved the tone feature and was probably what I used the most.  I returned because I decided it was not worth it to me.  I have used an Apple watch and Fitbit and I understand this aims to be minimalistic but it just wasnt enough for me.",3
1602,"Not impressed overall.  Seems to track runs pretty well but gives very little credit for strength training, even when training hard.  I find my old Fitbit to be much more accurate.The sleep tracking is way up and does not detect all disturbances.  I don’t sleep well and get up and out of bed no less than five times a night.  This doesn’t record each disturbance.I will be going back to my Fitbit or possible looking at a Whoop",3
1603,I love the sleep monitoring of the halo it works great gives me a good  Insight of my sleep.,5
1604,"I love this product! I've been using it for 3 months and it has helped me to feel healthier.  Through the sleep feature I identified lack of deep sleep, and in using the related applications i am sleeping deeper and feeling more rested and energetic.  Through the body fat feature i have expanded my workout routine and already am seeing a difference. The reminders get me to exercise when in the past I would give into laziness.  The voice feature is very innovative.  I feel calmer and am more aware of my tone which is helping with my relationships and overall sense of well-being.The device is cute, comfortable and affordable.  I am delighted with my purchase! Thanks, Amazon!",5
1605,"I don't get the bad reviews, keeps track of a lot of things and does a great job. I tried Tone, didn't see any benefit so I turned off. All the other tracking sensors work great. I learn a lot about my sleep. I get a ton of points for all the activities I do all day. A lot of people complains about not getting the 150 points, but I don't get it. If you don't get the points is because you're not active, simple as that. I get a lot of points without issues. I think is a good product for the price.",5
1606,Loved this product when I first received it. Wore it 24/7 until several weeks ago. Bluetooth Connectivity began to fail after every charging sequence and erased previous data. I was averaging 8000 steps a day and I work at a desk everyday. But the device deducts for the times your inactive? By the end the device seemed counterproductive. The device has a lot of options but sometimes too much is just exactly that. Too Much.,3
1607,Excellent sleep tracker.,5
1608,"Have had several fitness trackers over the years, the most recent being a Whoop. The Amazon Halo is by far the best of the lot.It has several features which I find extremely beneficial, most especially the body fat scanner, sleep tracking, activity tracking and voice analysis.The best thing about this is that you do not need to have your phone nearby to store the data.I would highly recommend this to anyone!If you are unsure about the purchase and would like to ask me any questions, please feel free to leave a comment and would be happy to respond.Have now had for over 3 weeks and just have become hooked.Absolutely LOVE IT!!!",5
1609,"I have loved my Amazon Halo for the first year of owning. The sleep tracker was my favorite feature and I loved the videos/health tips in the app. However, my Halo randomly stopped working two weeks after the one year protection. I have tried every troubleshooting tip I could find, including a factory reset multiple times with no luck. It seems like the sensor itself is what stopped working, as it still connects to the app and “refreshes” but no data will populate and it won’t read my pulse. I purchased this last year when the Halo was brand new, so I hope they have enhanced their technology since. I am mostly disappointed with the lack of support from Amazon since the one year protection has ended.",2
1610,"Absolutely love my Halo!!!  My husband got it for me for Christmas and I am in love!  I tried everything before this, from Fitbit to the Bellabeat; nothing stuck for me.  Halo is perfect!  I use the Tone feature several times a day because it has helped me with my interactions both professionally and personally.  I was shocked to see the analysis after I marked conversations or even used the Live feature!!  I am sleeping better, also, with the the recommendations and Labs offered.  It is, by far, THE BEST band on the market!!!Amazon....PLEASEEEEEE keep this going!!!!!  And please bring other Amazon backed bands as options to buy!!!!  :)",5
1611,"I enjoyed this band but I won't be using it because it really would be better with a clock on it.I like how the movement is calculated, I think it's better than fitbit steps.The voice recognition has blown my mind. It's crazy to look at while dating or a job interview.I do wish the battery lasted longer than 3/4 of a day (without voice recognition) and that it had a watch feature.",3
1612,"Tone analysis and body composition scanner are my favorite features, and something that my Apple Watch doesn’t provide.",5
1613,Every time a new activity been comes out I get it but guess what this one for 64 bucks does more than either ones I’ve had it is so comfortable it’s not that vinyl stuff or you get sweat everywhere I’m not worried about it falling off the Velcro is fantastic and it’s not that messy Velcro.Every day I try more new things my husband and I listen to nighttime music it tracks my sleep tracks my steps it links up to my WW weight watchers app this does so much and even when it hits or I need to pay three dollars a month for it I will do it it is totally worth it give it a try you’ll love it,5
1614,"I got this device to help my teen improve sleep habits. I picked the Halo because it has no screen. While the device confirmed teen was simply staying up too late, it only worked about 50% of the time (and that’s generous) tracking sleep. Even when it did track, often (about a third if the time) it arbitrarily selected odd times to start or stop tracking despite me knowing with certainty the teen was awake, or asleep, etc.  I reached out for tech support and they admitted the device is INSANELY sensitive to being too right, too loose, wrong direction, etc. Given the technology available, it shouldn’t be THIS sensitive to being 1 mm too loose/tight. Even when confirmed it was placed accurately, it just didn’t track data consistently.  Also, the tech said the app allows the user to edit the correct sleep time - mine would not allow me to do that and the tech said the device should be replaced and the app deleted/reloaded. After reloading the app 3 times in 6 weeks, I’m confident it’s just not well designed. I am returning the item.",1
1615,I have really liked the style and ease of my Halo. The app has been simple to navigate and the sleep tracker is a favorite.The only downside is that it's not always clear if the halo is charging correctly.  There are no charging indicators and sometimes it's not actually charged while in the charging clip.,4
1616,"After 2 months... I don't think the accuracy is there for a monthly fee.I doubt i will continue my subscription.Also, the charging dock is a pain! It takes almost a full minute for me to situate the band correctly in the clip for it to charge. I know I minute isn't long... but when trying to plug in a device with this level of technology it feels way too long! A simple magnet connector to align it within the clip would be extremely beneficial!",3
1617,"I got this as a sleep tracker to help me figure out how much actual sleep I am getting as a new mom. The fitness tracker is just a bonus. I actually really like the app. I’m happy it doesn’t have a watch face, it’s easy to wear. The battery dies quickly though! My only complaint.",5
1618,Dislike the it was difficult to pair.  It does track and that I like.,4
1619,"The app is great- the band is comfortable and seems reasonably accurate.  I find it motivating.  When it works- which is about half the time.  I had this for a month with no issues, but now it disconnects every day or two- which is frustrating when you’re on a walk and want to check your heart rate, or how many points you’ve earned and so on.  VERY frustrating to have to re-pair the device, turn off and on, turn the phone off and on, turn your Bluetooth off and on.. then have to factory reset.. need the charger to pair again, and you don’t have your charger because YOU’RE ON A WALK!!!A hundred bucks wasted, as fas as I can tell. And I’m still paying on it!!!",2
1620,"The reason I like this product is that it is more  accurate in terms of all information it reports. I have a better sense of what I need to make adjustments to. For example “tone” knowing the areas that make me uncomfortable or anxious and the people that are sound during these times is helpful. The sleep reconstruction is helpful in terms of getting me to “unplug” and what those positive results look like. I thought that the size of the device might be cumbersome, however it is pleasantly non existent. I only remember I have it on when I look for results.",5
1621,"Battery life is abysmal, a daily 1 hour charge. Insight isn't giving you anything that you don't already get with any other fitness tracker. Seemed accurate to my fitbit within a few steps, heartrate was similar, tone was novel when it decided to work. Not worth the price or subscription fee. Doesn't have a display so can't double as a watch meaning you are wearing two devices on your wrist or wrists.Exercise stuff was neat, but everything similar is available for free on youtube so again, why pay for it? Body composition photo 3D model scan was just strange.Overall, I went into it hoping it would let me dump my fitbit, but after trying it for two months, it is on par with the $20 knock-off fitness trackers you can find elsewhere on amazon.",2
1622,"I signed up for pre-order, and my first one stopped working within a month. I received the second replacement unit and in 3 months, the second device was not working again. I called the support to use my warranty. But the tech support doesn't know what they are doing and kept asking me to do all kinds of troubleshooting myself which I have done so many times already.  I've been dealing with them for almost 3 weeks now and they are doing some experiments with the developer literally instead of replacing the unit for me.  By the way, the halo band is not only having a problem with its durability but also nothing ingenuine about the device except voice analysis which is not very accurate anyway. If they provide better support, it would make my experience a little better but they don't.  I don't recommend this halo device after using two devices for the past 4 months.",2
1623,I can not see past day results,5
1624,"I got this for the sole purpose of tracking my sleep. The problem I'm finding is some times it's not tracking and you don't know it because you have to pull out your phone, open the app and go to the ""live"" tab to know. Seems like a green light on the halo somewhere would have solved this issue. I wake up at 6am and find that either the halo thinks I've been up since 3:30am or it just stopped tracking me around that time.",3
1625,"I have been an avid user of Fitbit for almost 8 years. I continued to use my Fitbit in conjunction with my Halo for accuracy. I will say they measure the same. I liked the idea of the Halo being able to tell me how I sound when talking to people. I do wish with telling me how I sound it would replay the portion of conversation it detected. My biggest issue is the battery, a day maybe two. With so many smart/fitness watches available I expected a better battery.",3
1626,I loved the tracking systems but the case and bracelet materials are not very high quality and gave me skin rashes around my wrist,3
1627,"Very poor customer service on this device. I was unable to communicate with a human that had any true knowledge and was not using a script to diagnose issues. It was assured to me that the failure with Bluetooth HR sharing was a flawed device. A new device was sent and there is no change. The issue that persists is over multiple machines (rower and treadmill) of different makes, the machine sees the Halo Band but will not connect to it. It simply times out. Such a basic function.",1
1628,"I was really excited about the features the halo has to offer but as it turns out, my tone of voice is pretty predictable. This was on work days, a little softer on weekends. The body fat calculator is pretty cool, but the features on a Fitbit are honestly a little more inclusive and helpful (calorie tracking/water intake, menstrual tracking). I find the halo to be a bit “one note” and to have to pay for a subscription in addition, I don’t feel there’s much of a benefit.",3
1629,"Edit to add: now 12 months later, doesn't wrk at all. Im very disappointed that it didnt even last 12 months. Dont forget to cancel your subscription on this one!I really liked this activity tracker for all of it's features. However, since buying it in October the battery doesn't keep a charge. Need to put it on doc daily which doesn't really help with the compliance when I forget to put it on",3
1630,So this is indeed my favorite fitness tracker.  I enjoy that I'm not buzzed constantly by message notifications from my phone.  I love the point system based system to track my activities and the insights to my sleep patterns.  Only took a star away as it seemingly needs to be charged constantly.,4
1631,"Features I especially enjoyed: activity monitoring, live heart rate feedback, sleep monitoring. Features not to my liking: tone -- pretty much useless. The body fat assessment is... interesting but not particularly helpful. But since the six-month initial period has expired the features I appreciated the most are no longer available without a subscription. Annoying. I'll be looking for an alternative, including one with a readable face.",3
1632,I would've given five stars but I find it difficult to charge.  I have to shift around the ba d in the charge to line up correctly and it gets frustrating.  That's my only negative.  Otherwise I love my halo and use this over my previous tracker.  Love the voice feature.,4
1633,"I’m on the fence. I haven’t worn a fitness tracker. I love the watch I wear, or I would have already transitioned to an Apple Watch for the health aspects. I like the fact that this isn’t a watch and doesn’t have a screen. I have felt sort of unimpressed by it, overall, but I do like that it tracks basic things like steps, how meaningful movement is, etc. I feel like it’s okay. I wish I loved it. I want to love it, but so far, more...meh.",3
1634,"I was able to get this a few months ago. My main complaint is that the setup from the app took me about 30 minutes to an hour. I tried the scanning body fat, whatchamacallit, a couple of times but for some reason, it's not working for me. I'm mainly using it for the sleep tracker as well as my steps. Honestly, if it wasn't for that, then I wouldn't have finally addressed my insomnia as much as I am, now, so I am appreciative of that.",3
1635,I got this the end of February 2021.  It stopped working yesterday.  They only have a 1 year warranty on them.  I enjoyed using it while I had it but I won't buy another one.  It isn't compatible with other fitness apps yet either.,2
1636,I really like this product from an accuracy standpoint.  The body fat was spot on with my doctor’s review.  Reviewing the sleep tracking showed me why I felt tired on some days and well rested on others.  The only issue is that the charging cradle could be easier with docking the Halo.  Overall I have throughly enjoyed it.,4
1637,"Good first effort but so many things need to be fixed.  You also get punished for not completing the required amount of movement for the day/week - not sure the steps are accurate either!!  I'd say wait, if this is something you really want - not having a screen is a huge plus, at least for me, it doesn't catch your eye every time you move your wrist!  Wish I could return it but it's past the window....oh well :-(",3
1638,"In theory it should be a good product. A few weeks into owning it, it keeps disconnecting from my phone, and it won't want to reconnect until hours later it randomly does; it is an unreliable product. The sleep function also needs a lot of work, unless I really do transition immediately from being awake to REM sleep. The calories estimate is pretty wild, though that shouldn't really be a surprise; calories estimates tend to be bad, and this is no exception.",2
1639,Overall didn't love the band. It looked very nice but had a lot of inaccuracies and ended up returning it. The body fat scanning feature was awesome but outside that it didn't really have a lot of benefits for me,3
1640,"I've had it a few months.  Sleep tracking starts if you sit down and watch TV or read a book before bedtime.  I wrote Amazon, they blew it off.Body stats and scans are not helpful.  They don't share the science.Tone, it's off, it doesn't learn personal style, and if you turn it on to the most accurate setting the battery dies in less than a day.Activity is not accurate.  It's based on heartrate and movement tracking.  It lets you modify your activity but doesn't seem to differentiate between activities or carefully measure time in high heartrate zones.All in all, keep looking, this is not the ""wearable"" it promises to be, and in three months I've seen zero progress in new developments for the Halo.  Right when it should be dropping updtes weekly to fine tune the experience and respond to feedback from many other users.",2
1641,"I love this wrist band! Membership comes with great meditation and workouts. Sleep tracking is highly useful to get the best sleep. The only issue I have is that the pedometer cannot be synced with myfitnesspal. Also, if you don't move your arms when walking (stroller, cart, etc) then your steps won't get counted!!",4
1642,Love all of the features. My favorite are the body fat tracking and sleep tracking.,5
1643,"I've worn my Halo each night since Christmas, with the exception of two nights where my wife wanted to try it. I've been surprised by the sleep analysis quite a bit and can say that it's already inspired me to alter the way I try to get a good night's sleep. Like that's actually possible. :-)",4
1644,"I was utilizing Halo strictly for sleep monitoring and as a pedometer. In both those areas, it performed well. Minor tweaks with the user interface might make those two better. But then, it just stopped working. I’ve used it since November, and then about a week ago, all functionality ceased. I try to charge it, and the green sensor light will come on, but the lights on the side don’t light up and my app doesn’t recognize it. 🤷‍♀️What a disappointment.",3
1645,"I was so excited to upgrade from a cheaper fitness watch and app with less functions to the amazon halo. Within 2 hours of receiving the device I had already called tech support. Uninstalled, reinstalled the app. Restarted my phone. Then band wouldn't synch. Reset band to factory settings. Reentered all my information, Again. App still would not allow me to access all the startup features. Most notably the movement function. This band ticked all the boxes I was looking forward in a fitness watch, especially since it linked together with Weight Watchers. I was even ok with paying for the subscription after 6 months. But the app was not fully functional. I am frustrated and let down.",1
1646,"Perhaps it was Amazon's plan all along to use their paying customers as beta-testers to a half-baked product, because it's hard to believe someone would sign-off on launching this product.Activity points are essentially a finger in the wind and not anchored on any accurate data. The step counter, the most basic function of a tracker is the most inaccurate of all. Repeatedly underestimates the number of steps in a normal walking session by 80-90%. Interestingly, when placing the band around my ankle, it had no trouble tracking actual foot steps. However, it gave me 70 activity points for a 20min light walk, so I could technically achieve the 150 point weekly activity target by just a couple of light walks.On the wrist, unless you're swinging your arms like you're in the middle of a military parade, the majority of the foot steps aren't recorded.The sleep app tracker looked promising until I started to see that sleep score reported in the morning CHANGED hours later, as if I was still sleeping.The cherry on top was that I contacted customer service several times, and got the same generic troubleshooting guide, which didn't fix any of the issues. When pressing for more support, customer support supposedly accessed my data to determine source of issue, but failed to reply. After 4th attempt I gave up and item is on the way back.",1
1647,"Quick review: says my HR is 170-180 when I’m (calmly) driving down the road. Other times I can be active at work on the scene of a motor vehicle accident or picking someone up off the floor and my HR is regular. Sleep data seems a bit off as well but it’s a good *idea* about how your sleep is. Wish it recorded SpO2% as well. It helps remind me that I’m fat and need to work on getting myself healthy, just wish it was more accurate instead of saying I was getting steps in while driving down the road with 180 heart rate?? I think I’d definitely feel that in my chest.Voice also doesn’t do a great job. I’ve been having a good time joking and laughing and it told me I was mad? Whatever I don’t use that a lot.",2
1648,"I got this when it was first available last year. I wore it for a week or two (the band was pretty small, but I have large hands). The body of it was a bit large and uncomfortable and woke me up more than once when trying to sleep. What's more is that the band stopped charging after a few weeks. I set it aside, a bit disappointed - but I recently tried it again and was reminded of how the experience was, which left a sour enough taste to come write a review. I love a lot of Amazon devices, but I'm pretty disappointed here.Update: Amazon contacted me and offered to replace it. We'll see how the replacement does, but it would have been helpful to have a path to contact someone through the Halo help pages - every path I went down in the help pages led to a dead end.",2
1649,I find this device very helpful for tracking not just my sleep and fitness but also my stress levels. The voice recognition works pretty well and gives me a more descriptive analysis of the emotions in my voice than i anticipated. The voice recording will use the battery more so I don't leave it on all day but rather at certain intervals. The band fits great and I have had no skin irritation. I have also used the body scan feature which is a great Plus for my weight loss journey. Syncing with the app works great. I am pleased with my purchase.,5
1650,"Love that there's no screen. Love that info goes to the app on cellphone. Love that it monitors my health, activity and mood 24-7. Does exactly what was promised and does it very well. Makes monitoring my pulse, which is essential, an easy and effortless swipe.",5
1651,I have trouble keeping it connected.  And sleep portion is not working for me.,5
1652,"I've used the fitbit and really like the extra's on the Halo.  But today, the app started crashing every time I attempted to access a lab.  I was on chat with customer service for over an hour.  The first guy was okay, but I got another guy after I took a break from chat.  That guy was condescending and rude.  He asked me what ios version I had, and I told him.  Then he asked me again, and I told him again.  Then he said ""you already told me that twice, I need the correct software version if I am going to help you.""  Then he asked me to send the log files from the app.  I told him that the earlier guy had me delete/uninstall the app and then reinstall and that my history was erased.  So he gave me step by step instructions on sending the log file.  I told him I couldn't do that, again.  So he then he got really condescending and rude.  I really like the band, and all the extras (particularly the labs), but if this thing is going to go on the blink where I have to delete everything and start over, I probably won't renew my subscription.  Not if I have to go through rude customer service people to get it fixed.",1
1653,"I got this for Christmas and I really enjoy the app and the sleep tracking. But it randomly decides, especially when I'm driving, that my pulse is 150+. It's no where near it.As these ""activities"" are self tracked I can't delete them and it completely skews my points.Yesterday I gained 96 points sleeping in the car while my S/O drove. Not sure if I have a melon or what. I've tried making sure it's tight etc. but no luck",2
1654,I like the sleep pattern detailed feedback and voice patterns which I suspected did not come across positively. I'm not using all aspects Halo has available yet. I'm motivatedto do so as I incorporate a few things and make them my own. I am not having issues charging Halo and find the band comfortable.,4
1655,"I have had this tracker for 4 months and have worn it religiously, it worked really well. Now I am having problems syncing it with the app it is not tracking my sleep or tone like it used to. The activity is tracking less and I have increased activity. Also it does not hold a charge as long dies really quickly. Nice idea but no longevity. I would pass on this not worth it at all.",3
1656,"The band seems fickle. It worked alright for the first two months but now it rarely syncs, the battery life is shorter, and I don’t think the tone feature works well.  I read the passages the way I would read aloud, but it says that I sound bored 70-80% of the time.  The app is slow despite installing all the updates and freezes or closes often.  I want to love the band but unfortunately I am looking for a different one.",3
1657,"I would rate the band 5 stars except I'm not the keenest on a fabric band.  The band is comfortable but no matter what I do it picks up odor easily.  I have a Garmin with a silicone band and I can work out without it smelling.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the fabric band.",4
1658,"Was nice while it lasted and they were starting to get the bugs out too 😔It just broke on me, the plastic cover over the sensor came off. So now I can’t use it anymore 🥺😔 I was starting to enjoy it because it seems to becoming more accurate. I believe I purchased this in October so I got 8 months out of it.",3
1659,"App is easy to set up and use.  Halo has not been able to track my sleep correctly.  If I wake up in the middle of the night, it will restart tracking from zero.  Most nights it records nothing.  Other features seem alright but I must be a monotone because the tone feature also records me as neutral.",3
1660,"Very good idea, sleep tracking function is amazing and very sensitive. I didn’t like much how it fits - not very comfortable. For example Apple watch I even don’t notice I have on my hand. Also, battery is awful. After using for a several months it doesn’t last even a day",4
1661,Not enough resolution on data available. Would like to zoom in more on charts.,5
1662,"It’s improving. I really like it now, as opposed to when I first got it.",5
1663,I would have given 5 stars if there was an Open API available to develop apps that use the information being collected.An oxygen sensor would have been nice too.The worst thing about this device is the battery life.  I can't even get 24 hours out of it if I leave the mic on.,4
1664,"Sleep tracking is almost a complete fail.  It hasn't registered any of my sleep for over a week straight, and only rarely registered since I received it 3 weeks ago  (I am wearing it properly.  I have reset the device.  Nothing helped).I'm hoping there will be some sort of app/firmware update to remedy the poor performance.Additionally, the LED light colors and button press inputs don't exactly match what the guide says in the app.  That needs tweaking also.",3
1665,Love knowing how many calories I burn per day.,5
1666,"The mobile app is easy to use. The sleep tracker is very informative not only one hour long I slept but the quality of my sleep. Same with the activity tracker. It counts steps yes, but also uses my heart rate to determine intensity of my activity as well so I can see how much sedentary, low, moderate, and intense activity I am doing in a day/week. I like that there is no screen on the band so no light flashing in my face at night when I move disturbing my sleep. The band is easily adjustable and easily washable.",5
1667,"This app is awesome to use. So many options to use which can meet the needs for most people. It is a little expensive, but I think worth it. The downside to this is if you use the voice recognition you burn through your phone battery quickly. Seems like I’m always charging my phone. The other thing and the worse part in my opinion is it is extremely uncomfortable to wear and hard to get use to.",3
1668,"The only negative I have is that it's slightly uncomfortable to wear all the time. The back of the sensor part of the unit presses against the skin. I know it needs to, but it makes wearing it slightly annoying.",4
1669,"It is a lot smaller than i though which is a good thing in my opinion. However, I know that the body fat measurement is not supposed to be 100% accurate, but I do know my real measurement and its almost 10% off from my actual measurement so it can be better. But overall I really like it so far.",4
1670,"Device itself is great, I haven't used the tone feature. I realize my tone for the most part is sarcastic so don't need my health device to tell me that. The mobile app keeps crashing as the device doesn't have a screen it is a must that the app to work.",4
1671,"At first I was ecstatic with this product. After a month it stopped accurately tracking my heart rate during workouts. I do not agree with their 150 weekly point goal. If you have a desk job this is not for you. It was difficult to get a ""high intensity"" heart rate that could give me points. Anytime I sat it would take points away. The workout ""programs"" repeat the same few videos for 4 weeks. It got boring. I'm glad I paid the introductory price.",3
1672,"I chose Halo to see if it would be a combo tracker for both sleep and activity. Sleep tracking seems fine. For activity, Halo pairs with only two other things...weight watchers and some other thing. It's a no for Strava (at least I can't get it to pair).It probably will in the future, given Halo is newish. But until then it is underwhelming.",3
1673,"The Halo takes up wrist space, but has no watch function.  For activity and sleep tracking, it works something like my Fitbit, but since it has no face the wearer can see fitness info only on the app.  The voice analysis told me I was sad when I was happy.  I never used the body analysis because I was uncomfortable giving Amazon access to photos of myself in my underwear.This device might be for you, but it wasn’t for me.",3
1674,Worked great for a year until the back sensor screen came off which appears to have happened in other reviews. I liked it but with the product was more durable.,3
1675,"Several problems arose right after purchase: 1) sleep was recorded so inconsistently. When reporting the problem, a pat answer told me how to ensure I wore it correctly to better measure activity -- nothing to do with sleep.  2) all of my sleep was never recorded. With health issues and being a senior citizen, I sleep 2-3 hours at a time, multiple times a day. No adjustments were available to accurately record sleep. I provided feedback and received no response other than ""make sure the bracelet is snug on your wrist."" I made sure it was snug, and I repeatedly double tapped the sync button on the Halo. 3) Activity list didn't have several of my exercise choices.  4) At my age, sedentary time should not rate penalties. As a former athlete in multiple sports, I believe Halo should be able to option level of activity according to age, health conditions, and abilities. I'm very frustrated that I gave this device a good trial, and now I'm outside the window of returning it for a refund. Amazon, please use this feedback and make adjustments so my $100 won't go down the drain in vain.",1
1676,"Hello! I was very excited for Halo. Unfortunately, on a trip out of state, the actual Halo device came off of the band. I don't know exactly when it happened. But, I noticed it when I took it off to charge it. There was nothing to charge. Just the band. Still sounds like a great idea. Just be careful to make sure the device is still on the band.",3
1677,"I have been very happy with my Amazon Halo. Because I have sleep apnea I have made good use of the sleep tracking and I am working to improve my sleep habits. The app is very helpful and I have really liked the get active videos. I haven't used them as much as I should because of the holidays, but I am going to get that going again. There are a lot of different types of workouts available which is great. The body scanner is nice too, but I had trouble getting perfectly positioned with my arms. I intend to keep using it though because it's helpful to have a reference for changes in my body while working out.",5
1678,"Pretty average. Honestly most fitness bands become glorified watches anyways, so not having a watch face is kinda rough. Some fun stuff but wouldn't reccomended for anyone who is more of a weight lifter. Never used the tone monitoring thing cause why do I want that.... But there are a good selection of apps and programs to try, if you are someone willing to stick with them.",3
1679,"My biggest gripe is how it won’t work as a heart monitor with other apps. It gives you a whooping two other apps it will work with, one of them being weight watchers. Gee thanks. Also , the band isn’t very elastic, it’s awkward and difficult to put on. On top of that, you have to remove this thing to charge it. You can’t charge while wearing like the Whoop. The voice recognition is pointless, it gives you 4 different tones. Often it rates me as different tones seconds apart, how am I supposed to remember what I was saying? Body fat analysis seems accurate but of course has nothing to do with the band itself. It does seem to do an accurate job of HR measuring but overall I’m not super happy with the band right now. Mostly because it won’t act as an HR monitor with my favorite workout app, FITIV.",2
1680,"For the most part this was a mediocre device. The lack of display would make one think the battery would be good. Unfortunately, if you turn on the the one ""cool"" feature which is voice analysis, then your battery is dead in a day. The general use of the device yes is simplistic which is good, but having to check your phone/app constantly to just see where you are in your day is a hassle.Also, the information that was given seemed to be inflated comparably to other devices that do the same thing. My Garmin Fenix with GPS constant showed me that the Halo was over stating my steps.HR was not able to give a 24 hour read... it was either live or based on a workout... never actually giving me a daily read out of how my HR was through out.This could be good but overall right now it is very much a beta product.",2
1681,"The Halo is a great size, has some nice features and i like the classy look but I miss not having a face on it so that I can see right away how many steps, heart rate, and the time just to name a few, without having to pull out my phone.  I will be returning it and replacing it with another brand.  Thank you for trying.",3
1682,Love all features of Halo. Wish there was an easier way to access saved sleep programs.,5
1683,"I need a new one.  I lost mine.  So upset.  Wanted to really give the videos a try. The voice thing is great.  Really helps with watching how you may be interpreted,  especially over zoom.  I really need to get a replacement.",4
1684,"I have been using the Halo for about a month now. There are some minor issues but nothing breaking about the device yet, mainly app data update issues but is solved with an app restart. I have not been using much in tone as that was a secondary feature to me. What I have used of it out of curiosity seems very interesting. I recommend a spare band, if you swim with it, when they become readily available as the fabric one feels odd wet. My one non beta-ish concern is paying monthly when my 6 month period is over. I really don't need another paid service so I will evaluate this when the time arrives.",5
1685,sleep tracking,5
1686,I like it so much,5
1687,"I dont mind the Halo itself.  It's a good value relative it's competitors.Why such a low rating?  It takes so many attempts to get the device properly seated in the charger, that after a month or two I just got fed up with it and went back to a 6 year FitBit.If they can figure out a way to easily charge the device without spending minutes to get it lined up properly (then gently set it down so it doesn't get loose) then I would buy the updated one.Trying to track fitness and development patterns for personal growth shouldn't be interrupted by a poorly designed charger...seriously.",2
1688,,5
1689,read the fine print. this is not for people trying to correct a sleeping problem!. suggest more emphases  on the things this tracker can do well and avoid the disappointments that are not addressed properly in the first place. with a precaution to research the sleep mode you will save time and money. dot4dash,3
1690,"Activity is good, sleep tracking has problems and is not that useful.",5
1691,"Really disappointed to find that the band won't synch to the app anymore despite double pressing the button. Button is broken so it's worthless now, unable to get any data plus it's left a burn mark on my wrist",4
1692,,5
1693,"I bought this as my first smart watch hoping to use it to track activity and sleep.  Sleep tracking is interesting and feel it is quite accurate (I.e. when it says I got a higher score I feel rested and when I don’t feel as rested the score reflects that).  The low overall rating is due to the accuracy of the activity levels.  When working out, it would regularly not give me the credit for the exercise - I rode an exercise bike and watched the live heart rate for 15 minutes - I was in “moderate” or “intense” levels for 12 minutes of the 15 - after the workout it gave me credit for 2 minutes of intense and 2 minutes of moderate workout — what happened to the other 8?!  Will not subscribe after free trial is up, and will likely replace with another brand that has better reviews for being accurate in tracking workouts.",2
1694,I did not want to spend $$$ to track activity and sleep on my continued journey to better health.  The Halo has just what I needed to track sleep and activity.  Only issue I have is sleep tracking did not work with my WW app like the activity tracking did.,4
1695,Like what I see on the sleep side of things. Very accurate.,4
1696,I love the sleep tracking and how accurate it is. I like how it can tell me how long it takes me to fall asleep and how often I wake up during the night. I enjoy how it tells me my weekly heart points. It pushes me to strive for more each week.,4
1697,"I am so glad I purchased the Halo! The app has so many useful programs and workouts for improved sleep, nutrition, mindfulness and fitness. I initially purchased it to help track my sleep to figure out when I should go to sleep and set my alarm to wake up, but it has been so much more useful than that. I like that it gives a fitness score as opposed to simply counting steps because the intensity of the physical activity does matter. This Halo band has been the most fun (and probably most useful) present I have bought for myself this year :-)I definitely recommend purchasing a Halo because it is a great product.",5
1698,I really like the app and the device.  I was looking for a non-intrusive device and app to support my health.  I turned the voice component off because it burns the battery faster and was not important to me.  I like mobility assessment tool.  I received a customized program focused on improving my weaknesses.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  I appreciate the syncing with WW but only wish the sleep synced as well.  Overall a great app and device for someone looking for a less intrusive option.,5
1699,"This fitness tracker totes a ton of really cool features but unfortunately it doesn't track any of them well. 2 examples, I walked a 2.5 mile trek around a local lake.  I walk briskly and swing my arms while walking.  Halo recorded 500 steps total.  2nd example, when I wake up in the morning I take a bit of time to get my day organized on my phone.  I do this sitting up in my bed.  Halo is unable to recognize that I am awake during this despite all of my other fitness trackers having no problem recognizing the transition.  I haven't found any way to make my tracker more sensitive or to troubleshoot the issues either.  Very disappointing and a huge waste of money.",2
1700,"I give this product a 5 star review, it’s great! I only wish we could sync some of the options, like sleep with apple health.",5
1701,"It took me a while to start using it consistently - the battery life isn’t as good as my old fitbit Alta HR - but I’m really loving it now. The “tone” feature is unique and is a great check on mood/attitude, I love looking back at the end of a workday and checking how I sounded during various calls and meetings. Finally- there are a ton of free workouts and programs which are awesome. Really liking this now. I have small wrists and love how the pink band is subtle and isn’t a big black square like an Apple Watch.",5
1702,"I've owned the band for 10 months.  Every time I used the charger, it became harder to charge.  Pinching it at this point to charge is futile.  I'm ending my membership and will likely buy a different brand that doesn't requirea ten minute battle to charge.",3
1703,"After only a few months it wont hold a charge for even 24 hours. and thats with the voice recorder turned off.I reached out to customer service, was told they couldn't replace it right then, try again in 2 weeks. then when I tried again they basically said ""have you tried turning it off then back on"".edit: customer service has reached out and offered a replacement",3
1704,"I received this on the invite only Early Access. I'm not too impressed with it.-It has a point system rather than tracking total steps.It gives ""Average Daily"" -*Sedentary*Steps*CaloriesAbove it does say *steps, again they convert it to points. It never shows actual steps/miles.-The tone (tone of voice) tracker - not reliable. It only works a small fraction of the time. You can do ""Live"" for Heart Rate and Tone (of voice). I'm unsure why Tone (of voice) is even in the Live option. It's not like I'm going to keep that section open all the time and watch it while I talk. I just find the entire Tone tracker so unnecessary.-THE BAND - don't work out hard or sweat. The band soaks up all the moisture, but not for the better. It holds of the moisture in the band and continues to keep my skin wet around my wrist where it sits for the entire day.  Why would they make the band out of fabric material? Only 5 days in wearing it, and it stinks. My skin is chafed.-It drains my battery like crazy.  No matter if I have my battery optimizer on.All in all its not remarkable. It  I paid $66 and it's not worth it. -Cannot rely on accuracy.I sent it back.",1
1705,"I want to love this, but most of the time it does not read my tone despite changing the settings to always listen, which is what we purchased this for. Additionally after 2 months of use the battery doesn't last more than 5 hours. Initially the batter life wasn't that great (a days use) but now its not even worth wearing.",3
1706,I have had my Amazon Halo for a while now. Over time... you're going to start having a lot of issues. Like nowadays my halo doesn't recognize my voice. Most of the time my sleep is wrong. Also with that a lot of the data is incorrect. it was an awesome product at first yes. But sadly it deteriorated only after 3-4 months. Not even to a full year.,3
1707,"It's comfortable. I don't realize it's there. Which is good. It makes it easy to sleep in. Only thing I wish is that the app tracked what you ate. You get points for movement but if you eat more than you""move"" I think you should lose points. Forcing you to move more",4
1708,"Not the worst I've ever used in terms of fitness trackers, but had a tough time keeping it linked to my phone for starters, and the app had (for me anyhow) a lot of unneeded....gunk plus I'll agree with what another said that it's more demotivating. I've purchased a FitBit Charge 4 for the same cost and it's a better fit for me.",3
1709,"I was very excited about this device, but I'm disappointed because I will most likely need to return it. After wearing it for about 10 days, I developed a rash on my left wrist. I was not wearing it too loosely or tightly and didn't allow moisture to gather underneath, so I think I might be allergic to the acrylates or methacrylates that are in the coating of the device. The photo is after not wearing the band for 3 days, and I still have a rash and itching. Amazon's Safety and Compliance Information page (https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVHZZMHA9M6Y6JS5) suggests removing the band for an hour after extended wear, but doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose since it will no longer be tracking your steps? For now, I'm going to try to wear it on my right wrist and remove it often, but I'll probably end up returning it since I won't be able to gather all of my step data.",2
1710,I will admit I don’t get to put this tracker to its full use. I work in a high security area and can’t wear it to work but I use it mostly for sleep tracking. I’ve always been a really bad sleep and had to fight for every wink of sleep but I’ve learned how different I sleep from things during that day. Because I find it so beneficial for my sleep I would but again it suggest for people looking for same data,3
1711,"I normally hate wearing things on my wrists - I tried wearing a smartwatch for awhile but ended up selling it because the added value wasn't there - but this is easy to keep on and the data insights are great. Sleep, heart rate, and fitness data are detailed and informative. The app has useful benchmarks to put the data in context, and there is a lot of content in the ""labs"" section that adds further value. I haven't yet found much value from the tone of voice data, but it's surprisingly accurate. Overall, I wanted something unobtrusive that would give me insights about my habits that can help me live healthier, and this fits the bill perfectly.",5
1712,"My only issue so far is trying to download the videos for exercises. Ive reset it a couple times, supposedly its my phone settings, but SOME videos (not many) do work for a few minutes. I just wish I could see the time on my wrist and wish it would track Blood Pressure.",4
1713,I loved the body fats measurement and the scan that is created. I have found it to be very motivating and helps to push me to achieve my overall goals. I don’t feel comfortable about the voice component of the app. But I’ve not totally decided to omit using that aspect of the ban.,4
1714,V accurate and value for money,5
1715,"10 Years i have been suffering from lack of sleep due to a spine operation. Every time i move and my spine causes pain, i wake up.  The doctor had no idea how bad it was because when i was sent to a sleep study, it never shows what actually happens to me. The sleep app is one of the best inventions every that has changed my life. I cant say my sleep has gotten any better because we are still collecting data but it shows exactly what is happening to my body. Thank you so much for this feature and the others as well. I may never ever take this off. :)",5
1716,I like the features and style but the battery life if you're using the Tone feature is way too short at only max 2 days.  Without tone activated itll last +/- 5 days.  Its easy to use but I recommend not tightening too tight or it will be uncomfortable after wearing for a few days.,4
1717,"I had much hope for the Halo device and may try the Hali with display again because I would love fir this item to be successful. The fact is the unit never was able to pair with the iPhone/app. After trying several times, including troubleshooting from the App and online sources, the device, frustratingly, did not pair and hence was useless. I’ll wait until Amazon iron out the bugs before retrying. The device/service is attractive because the cost is much less that Whoop and Aura services and appears to be more comprehensive than what the iPhone offers for free. I gave it a 2 star instead of a 1 star since I could get the unit to pair with Bluetooth, but not through the app.",2
1718,The band overall is comfortable. I like that it measures my sleep. I haven't tried the Voice Recognition yet but I plan to. I don't like that I am wearing a wristband that has no time on it. I keep looking down but nothing shows up. Gotta get used to that.,4
1719,I’m still testing it out - I love the sleep tracking and the fact that the battery lasts for days. One of the main reasons I opted to purchase Halo was to limit my screen time. I am now wearing both my Apple Watch and halo side by side to see each I like better.,4
1720,I'll be updating weekly.On day 4 the Halo has mysteriously stopped syncing with the app. I've followed the troubleshooting guide to no avail. In the end I had to completely deregister and start from scratch which was pretty frustrating. The points are still there but the sleep data (the main reason for this purchase) is gone.Steps and activity seem fairly accurate. I'm hoping this was a hiccup. I do not plan to keep it if this occurs again.,3
1721,"Great for tracking pretty much everything you would need to know. It’s small enough I forget I’m wearing it and easy to sleep in. The only down side of it is it does not work with Apple health it uses its own stand alone app, if this was to happen then it would be perfect!",3
1722,Buen articulo,4
1723,"I liked the holistic approach to health metrics. However, there is far too much information and it is difficult to digest.Product reviews in the New York Times and the Washington Post have been quite critical of the product. I turned off the voice analysis and am unsure of the BMI. The exercise monitor is useful but not much more than on other products.I am staying with the Halo product/service knowing that Amazon will continue to improve the package in future iterations.",3
1724,"I love that it does not have a clock on it. But it does not sync my steps to my apple health. So that is a problem because all my other apps read from health. Also once you turn on tone, it eats the battery and I can’t figure out how to turn that off.",3
1725,Currently pregnant. Can't wait to be able to us the full capoblilty of the band. The sleep tracker has been a great way to make better sleeping habits and be able to get the best quality of sleep.,4
1726,"I like the idea of this device. It’s weird that you don’t even get a clock face though as it’s large to have on your wrist all day.  I’ve had so many issues with it connecting to my phone and the app crashing on me. I ended up going with a Fitbit when this died 10 months after I bought it because they’re easier and you get an interactive face on it.Pros: tracks tone of voice, has lots of programs on the app, helps track body fat.Cons: device didn’t make it a year and just stopped working all together, app crashes constantly, connecting to the app only happens when the stars align otherwise it doesn’t work.",2
1727,"For all those people who are complaining that technology is creepy: don't use those features. The same people will happily carry around a spying device in their pockets all day long. The sleep and activity tracking features of the Halo are very useful. I also really like the fitness programs that are recommended and get automatically tracked. I am yet to calibrate the body fat scan with other devices. Overall, I love how unobtrusive the device is - and helps me keep my non-exercise activity high. The body-fat measurement is probably the most important feature that has been so far unavailable to most people.",5
1728,"I finally started to use my Halo and I actually love it. It is so lightweight and comfortable that I forget I have it on. I’m mainly using it for heart rate, sleep and activity. I’m still getting the hang of it and using the features on the app. But I’ve been wearing it for 4 days (only raking off while showering) and so far so good. I have previously had an expensive watch-face type tracker that was uncomfortable and constantly needing charged (and was too complicated to navigate while wearing). For my needs the Halo is much better and I can fully charge it while I’m in the shower.",5
1729,Like the Halo a lot. Seems very accurate. Similar to Apple Watch as far as step count etc. the one negative thing as I had seen in other reviews is that it does leave  a mark on your skin as you can see in the picture. My Apple Watch has never left a mark such as this.,3
1730,I absolutely love this fitness tracker!!! It has converted me from being a strict Fitbit follower. I love the body scan. Gives a great perspective than just the scale. I really like the fact that it focuses on being active rather than just 10000 steps. Also it is very non distracting since it does not display or vibrate for phone messages. Looks beautiful too!The one thing that I would like it to have is GPS connection but then that it is an easy fix with using another tracking app.Thank you Amazon!!!,5
1731,"i like what this band has to offer and it seems to be very accurate but the battery is very annoying. With ""Tone"" on only last about a day and a half. With ""Tone"" off it almost doubles (Still not enough). Tone is a great feature but they need to find a way for it to work without killing the battery. The data is no good if it sits on the charger while you do stuff",3
1732,"I was so excited about this product. I was desperate to be given early access. I regret buying it, even with the discounted price. I should have taken it back. I knew upfront that it wasn’t going to give you any information from the device, but turns out that is really inconvenient. I keep looking down for the time. It doesn’t give you any incentive. There’s no food tracking. The tone analysis always says I sound sad. It has caused pain in my hand and wrist. I find it uncomfortable to sleep in. It’s not very attractive looking. I was hoping it was going to be more simple and concise, but when you open the app it’s full of articles. Who has time? Battery life is terrible. Disappointed. I love Amazon products. I was hoping it would send me push notifications to motivate me. Doesn’t compete with apple or fitbit.",2
1733,"I love the apps and features of the Halo. However, after owning the product for 3 months I've developed what looks like a burn twice.  I don't wear the Halo in water at all so I'm unsure of the exact cause.  Its unfortunate as the data seemed spot on.",3
1734,"while i was able to use it, before connection issues, i did find for my purpose it was satisfactory - i think it needs more maturity, but over all, if you don't have connection issues, i think it will work for most people.keep in mind, this is the most basic level of fitness/activity tracking - if that's all you need, you will be good.Eugene",3
1735,As a person who works with people all day it’s very convenient to have the band tell me how I sound especially in specific situations. The sleep tracker isn’t accurate. I assume it only tracks around your normal sleep time and not naps. The tone on the band is awesome! And the band all in all is very comfortable.,3
1736,"Don't waste your money.Positives:The body fat is fairly accurateThe activity points are motivatingCheaper than whoop brandNegatives:Heart rate monitor is not accurate.  It works about 25% of the time and while training at a high level, will begin to read an accurate HR, but 10-15 minutes into the workout will begin to read a resting HR.  I am cross referencing this with a Samsung Galaxy Watch and Pulsox.  At times when I am +130bpm, its reading 70-80.  This greatly affects the activity score.Steps are inflated.  While cross referencing to my Samsung, I am typically 15-20% higher on my Halo steps. This also affects the activity score.I have set tone to provide as much feedback as possible, it typically gives 5-10 recordings per day.  I thought this would provide feedback at a much higher rate, especially in situations where I know that I was speaking in a way that would record a response (both positive and negative)In conclusion, you get what you pay for with this cheaper version of a Whoop fitness tracker.",1
1737,I was looking forward to this new device to help me track my activity. The mobile app is good. Easy to navigate. My issue is the accuracy of the body scan. I was excited to use this feature. But after 6 weeks it’s telling me I’m a higher body fat percentage even though I’ve lost weight and been consisting exercising with cardio and weight training. There’s no way it’s right. My clothes are loser. Maybe the technology is still working itself out.,3
1738,"I have owned multiple Fitbits in the past and will be using that as the main points of comparison (Fitbit Flex and Fitbit Alta HR).Overall the fitness aspect of it is very subpar, as it attempts to track fitness over the course of the day/week through ""activity levels"". Normally this would be fine but the fitness tracker is extremely bad at picking up exercise and activities as the HR tracker is only taken intermittently. For example, I would exercise on a recumbent bike at a pretty high intensity - and the live HR tracker says high intensity zone - but it would not be picked up by the tracker when calculating daily activity.Like many others have mentioned, the sleep tracking only works ""once per day"". So if you happen to have two sleeping cycles per day for 4 hours each, only the last one would be logged.The voice mood feature I did not bother with as it drains the battery life from the supposed 7 days to 2 days. The body fat scan does not seem consistent or accurate - there is a reason why a body fat scan is more time consuming and expensive.The one redeeming feature is the band for the tracker - that's about it. It is more comfortable than any other fitness trackers that I have used in the past.",1
1739,"I am extremely frustrated with my halo! I bought this item, and I loved it for a few months. I thought the band/attachment was cool. It worked great. The band fit great (I thought). Then one day I looked down, and the tracker was gone! It fell right out of the band on my wrist, apparently. So, I got just a few months out of it before my bands were worthless and I was out the money I spent on the Halo!This was the 3rd time it fell out, but I happened to find/catch it the first two times! I tightened the band, so it seemed like I couldn’t slip out any more.Apparently I was wrong. In the end, this was a very disappointing experience — especially from a company like Amazon. They need to figure out a better connection mechanism.",2
1740,"It's great for the money. I really question the accuracy of the sleep tracker. The app also leaves much to be desired. I think a simple fix would be for them to have the ability to connect to Apple health. Overall for the cost, I think it's a great device.",4
1741,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It worked great until it fell apart. I never used it in water. Took it off before showering... so not sure why it came apart.  I purchased this in May; its now August my return window was only a month. So I can't retutn it.",3
1742,I do water aerobics and would like to choose that as activity but that is not an option . The tone feature seem totally fabricated since it sometime tracks when I am not speaking at all. The sleep monitor is fine but no pre warning that battery would run out before sleep was complete.  The charger that came with stopped charging I did buy the back up charger but this product does not meet my expectations,3
1743,Works well to track steps and sleep.  Helpful to notice how my tone is throughout the day although I would prefer if it kept the notible moments for more than a few hours.  The body scan feature is cool and let's you see what you would look like at lower or highlighted body fat.,4
1744,"This device does EXACTLY as described. I’m not sure how users are losing points...I’m a teacher and rack in about 10,000 steps a day so by the end of the week I surpass the 150 points. I appreciate the BMI and use as a guide (which the device advises since it’s not an actual medical professional). It’s sleek, no skin irritations, and I hardly remember it’s on.It has nice mini programs within, like water tracking and fitness reminders. The articles are helpful and the recipes are great. The app is super user friendly and comprehensive.It doesn’t have a clock face...and never marked it as such.  I would recommend.",5
1745,"It did a good job at tracking sleep, heart rate and steps. I failed to see the value of the  voice feature. Body mass did not perform as I would have hoped.When the monthly charges began I stopped using it. Was not worth the monthly fee.",3
1746,It just disappears from the app and has to be completely reset every few months.  You lose all settings every time that is done.,3
1747,Great depend on it,5
1748,Amazing!,5
1749,"I did not wanted another screen to distract me from what I am doing so this was perfect for me. I have been using it since Christmas morning and I love it.Pros: Does not distract me by looking at the numbers on it as any other fitness tracker I had on the past. I love that it shows me how long I have been sedentary on any given day, it makes me get up and move. Love the body scan function and as someone else pointed out, you do not need to be naked to do it people!Cons: Only thing I would change is battery life, sometimes is too short.",5
1750,"This is a good start from amazon, the band is comfortable, no screen which is way better for me as you can wear a ""proper"" watch without looking stupid.there is some lack of accuracy with the program (sleep, steps, voice for example), but not dramatic.it's overall a good product and would recommend it.",4
1751,"I was an early adopter and supporter of the Halo, the product it self is amazing. You get all kinds of access to amazing health and wellness apps. The hardware is sleek and looks great. So why 2 stars? Recently my charger stopped working. I got on the customer help chat line, they informed me my ""warranty"" only covered a return. They couldn't send me a replacement charger (honestly the least polished part of the experience the charger is clunky and terrible). So now my only option is return it and get the purchase price back trouble is I bought it when it was in early release the pricing was set lower to increase attention. Now the price has risen and if I want to ""warranty"" my unit its going to cost me to buy a replacement.I don't know if Amazon understands what a warranty is, but if something fails on you and you have a warranty it means you take care of the product. Not make the only option to return it and eat the price difference if you want another one.I doubt anyone at Amazon will ever read this, but if you the customer is considering the Halo band know that you will not be supported once you have made the purchase.Amazon should stick to selling other people's hardware, people who actually support their products.",1
1752,"Sleep tracking is as good as any other tracker. Voice recognition is something that I thought would be great but then is a let down. The app reports what type of tone you are speaking but when I check the app hours later, I have no clue what I said hours ago. The voice report is simply unhelpful and very vague. So I turn it off because it absolutely kills the battery life.",3
1753,"Halo as become a part of my daily routine.  I have never used a fitness tracker before, but I cannot imagine using anything else. I like to wear a ""old fashion"" watch, so I have this on my right wrist, and it is very unassuming and not noticeable. I use it 24 hours a day (without voice monitor) and it lasts over 5 days in-between charges.  The sleep function is one of my favorites, I have been able to adjust my nighttime routine to maximize my sleep.  My only minor complaint is that the charger is a little tough to get aligned when you do need to charge it.",5
1754,"Overall, a pretty great fitness tracker. I like that it is minimalistic and not a distraction, however I think that it would benefit from music playback capabilities. I don't like to carry my phone if I am going to the gym or for a jog, and since this device does not have music services, that means I need to wear a second watch or actually carry my phone with me during these activities.",3
1755,Lost my tracker...fell out of the sleeve that it came with...but while I had it it still was hard to get my voice connected to it...no mater how many time s I got support help...it would not connect...overall I did like sad that I lost it (fell out) and wish I can get another one,4
1756,"I bought this for the introductory price at the end of November. I wore it every day, and have been fairly impressed with its performance. The charge holds up well, the app is easy to navigate, and I liked some of the app features. The only times I took it off was to shower, and if there was the possibility that it would be submerged in water. The band got a little dirty due to everyday wear. I would have liked a way to clean it without worrying about damaging the band component.Yesterday, I took the band off and the sensor cover was stuck to my arm. I replaced the cover over the sensor and put the Halo back on. The band still held a charge, but it no longer synced with the app. The band is now useless.I contacted customer service for an exchange. I was informed that the Halo couldn't be replaced, but I could get a refund. I was a little disappointed, but at least I'd get my money back. I received the confirmation for my return and noticed that I wouldn't be getting a full refund. This surprised me. The damage is due to faulty manufacturing. I believe this must be an ongoing problem since Amazon offers a refund instead of an exchange. I want a full refund.",1
1757,"I loved this product until it started to cause a rash on my arm. I didn't realize that it had metal by the sesor and it caused my skin to break out and 4 weeks later, it is still not fully healed. I am more dissapointed that I paid so much for something I can no longer use.",3
1758,"Great exercise program choices, recipes and wellness apps. Both previously owned Fitbits had heart rate tracking problems during intense cardio. Displayed 60& below BPM while Halo had me in intense zone. Sleep tracker recommends ""taking it easy today"" if you've not had good sleep. I don't miss the display screen at all but I am looking forward to receiving the new Halo Display soon! I recommend this device for both those just beginning an exercise and health program and advanced athletes.",5
1759,I like all of the functionality and think it provides some great information. My 2 dislikes? Add a face to at least display the time. I don’t see me wearing both this AND a watch- that’s just silly. Steps would be the other item I’d choose to see on my wrist ca app.,4
1760,This is my first fitness tracker so I don't have much to compare it to- but overall I've enjoyed the insights! I have used  the tone feature but sometimes mute the mic when I feel its not needed. I love the body scan and activity feature and the sleep information is useful too!,4
1761,"I had 3 smart watches before the halo. Apple Watch, and 2 garmin watches. I broke the Apple Watch because the screen is super sensitive. My first garmin watch, the battery died. The second garmin watch, someone stole it. I just needed a watch to just track my calories and sleep patterns. There’s different types of workouts you can setup for your watch. It’s overall, the best smart watch. Unless you want a watch to do more than what I mentioned, then don’t get this watch.",5
1762,Really great,5
1763,"This is the only fitness band that I have purchased that is comfortable on my wrist. Everything else including Iwatch and Fitbit get stuck either on my desk, it just seems to be in the way.  The halo is slim and I don’t even know it’s on and  I’m not distracted by the interfaceI use my Iwatch for things like seeing who is texting me and calling me, but all my fitness goals and sleeping, all of that stuff I like how the halo band works the bestThe best part about this band is you know that more is to come.Good job Amazon for a great fitness band",5
1764,"Wanted to love this, but can’t as it falls apart too often.  In just a few weeks of use, the tracker part has fallen out during tennis, when cleaning the house (reached behind a couch pillow and it got nudged out) and last night, while sleeping!  I’m primarily using the sport band (additional purchase) as I’m active - maybe that’s the issue.Likes: it’s non-interruptive (no screens or alerts), very comfortable, and it seems to track sleep well.  Waterproof.  And the app is intuitive and helpful.Dislikes: falls apart, voice/tone tracking seems inaccurate,  activity tracking could be more accurate.Overall, I would be pleased and continue using if it didn’t keep falling apart, but that’s a pretty fatal flaw - not only losing tracking, but one day I WILL lose the tracker part entirely.  Wish I could return.",2
1765,"I purchased the halo during its beta mode and I’ve been happy with some of the slow upgrades (like being able to save things - finally!). However, after getting the new iPhone 13 it’s nearly impossible to use the app which is starting to make the halo worthless! There are a lot of errors in fitness activities, where the video is missing - so how do I know what I’m supposed to do? There are huge problems with the sleep section and programs because the visuals are not showing or showing incorrectly on the new phone. How did Amazon miss this so badly? I wish I could submit feedback through the app but that has never been productive, intuitive, or an efficient process.",2
1766,My only real dislike is that there's no screen to check step counts through the day. You have to go to the app to view everything. When I'm at work I cant have my phone out so it would've been nice to be able to look on my wrist for the step counts.,4
1767,"Charger doesn’t hold device well. For first two charges, would only charge to 82 percent after hours and hours. Third charge went from 25 to 100 in a few minutes. Not sure what’s going on. Otherwise I like the sleep monitor and heart rate aspects. The movement points are useful too.",4
1768,To track sleep activity. Halo works quite well,5
1769,"Thought it was really cool; moderate accuracy for sleep and activity. Tonality is a nice add-on function and quite sensitive, but only when you turn the feature on and speak into the mic directly. If it is on the ""passive"" mode, the Halo band really doesn't do a good job capturing high and low moments. Battery is awful if you use the tonality feature too. If you want to track sleep and activity, you're better off with Oura.BTW, this thing used up 12 GB of my data in 2 weeks and I don't even know what the heck it was doing. So I stopped using the Halo band altogether; I will not be recommending this ""me-too"" product to friends.",2
1770,"The band fits well, and performs as advertised. The app is more the product and works well.My only complaint is the fragility of the charger. One of the pogo pins (springy contact that meets the band) bent after a few days of use and the device was unable to charge.",4
1771,A list of good things:I love the body scan feature. The sleep tracking is phenomenal. I love that I can throw the band into the washer after separating it from the tracker. The tone monitoring is both surprisingly accurate and helpful. The design is sleek. The band is comfortable.The BIG bad:You cannot link your to account to anything but Weight Watchers and John Hancock Vitality.Other bad:Shorter battery life. (1-2 days),3
1772,Excellent addition to anyone’s health!! Super accurate!!,5
1773,"The app for this band is, perhaps, what makes this product different. However, I would like at least a watch on the band since now I have to wear the band and my watch, which can get uncomfortable.  The app has an excellent interface and excellent labs. My only dissatisfaction is the lack of practical functions on the band. I understand the minimalistic idea of the band, but a watch would be nice.",3
1774,"I really like how lightweight the band is. I sometimes forget that I'm wearing it. I only have to charge it about once a week. I like the measurement metrics of how active I am, as well as the traditional step counter.I will be honest that i think it's features don't warrant a $6 monthly fee but I'm also a person with a condition that cannot work out, so I'm not able to maximize my usage of the apps features. For $6 monthly, I hope they eventually add food tracking and low impact yoga for those with limitations.Overall I give the Halo a positive rating.",5
1775,"I think for some people this would be a useful item but for me it isn’t really appropriate. It is very accurate but if you have other means of tracking your sleep and activity, I.e, Fitbit, Apple Watch apps, or cell phone apps you won’t need this too. I don’t use a lot of the features but if you did use them. It would be more useful.  The band isn’t very comfortable.",3
1776,"I wish I hasn't purchased it. It was decent at first,  worked well. Little bit of a pain not to have a screen but a necessary sacrifice to wear it at night and to preserve battery life.. but it took no time at all for the battery to go. It has to be plugged in daily now. I got a new phone, which caused a nightmare to re-set up band. It worked for a few days but now it no longer syncs with it and the tracking is virtually useless. Ill wear it at night and it says I didn't. Wear it while working out and it doesn't track. Canceling the membership and tossing it in a drawer somewhere.",2
1777,"This tracking device is light weight and easy to use. It is comfortable to wear. The app installs right on your phone. You can track your steps, your sleep, and your mood. I’m not sure how accurate the mood tracker is... I look bipolar according to it.. one minute angry, then happy, then sad.",4
1778,"This was a gift from my husband for Christmas.  I've since learned that I am a grouchy woman (per my Tone assessment) with 33% body fat.  This is absurd, I am 5'7"" and 140 lbs. I'm not obese by any stretch of the imagination and truthfully I'm quite pleasant to be around, haha.  I love the sleep monitor, but other than that I wouldn't use it for fear of a serious self esteem dive.",3
1779,"So it's been about a month since I bought the Amazon Halo.Pros:- Extremely comfortable- Very Fast Charge- You can immerse in water and swim with it- Tracking of sleep and heart beatCons:- Sometimes the sleep is off a little, if you go back to sleep it doesn't calculate\- They trick you when you first buy, to buy an additional charger- Pretty ugly, lol.- Needs some more features",3
1780,"It’s unforgivable at this stage for a health band to not show sleep heart rate by stage. I’m not sure why halo team decided to leave the sleep heart rate out as that’s one key element in early detecting incoming illness inflation infections in the body. Sleep heart usually goes up if the body is fighting infection yet on Halo band you only get one resting heart rate which does not separate waking vs sleep hours. As a result the reading heart rate is skewed to only show higher rate which is waking heart rate. In addition, the band does not accurately calculate steps activity compared to other fitness trackers. I will be returning this",2
1781,"I got this mostly for sleep tracking.  When it worked it was pretty good.  However, I often go to bed before midnight.  If I went to bed at 10, and got up after MN to go to the bathroom, it only recorded the hours after MN.  😬 The step tracker was great and really helpful.  Halo ordered on July 8, return window closed on August 8, died completely on August 23.  And, of course, I already paid for the year of Amazon tracking app.",5
1782,"Happy with my purchase, but hope I won't encounter any problems with the app when I leave the US. The rose gold band looks nice and doesn't distract me from my tasks. Tracks my activities and sleep as advertised. If you're a normally active person or you just want to start moving more without having to overly focus on your steps, etc., then I recommend getting this. Caveat: I only used the main features (which was the reason why I got this in the first place) and not the tone and body weight tracking features.",5
1783,The only thing I didn't like … is that the step counter is totally inaccurate … when I drive it marks as if I had walked that distance … the rest is very good!,3
1784,"Great product that does what its supposed to. Keeps track of activity, body mass, and important health information. I like the size and feel as I dont like big watches or heavy devices. Very durable. I charge mine about every 5 days but I do have the voice shut off. Sleep tracking is amazing.",4
1785,Can not use it,2
1786,"I was so excited to try out a Halo band. I've always had a Fitbit and thought this would be a different but better experience.I'm so disappointed. The app for this band us so confusing.  Tone rarely catches my voice.Why isn't there a clock display on the band. I knew there wasn't one when I bought it and I thought it would be ok. But just wearing it, I constantly looked at my wrist for the time to see a black band.The battery only lasts like 3 days and I don't have tone on but like 6 hours during the day.So yea, I didn't even make it a whole month and I'm going back to my Fitbit.",2
1787,"Has all the potential in the world, yet the app keeps on disconnecting my band... I have to reconnect multiple times a day. The required app is just broken, destroying the entire experience",2
1788,"The Halo is like how the US tries to be different by using the Imperial system instead of the metric system. Unique, innovative but causes more unnecessary work on part of the user.Think the tone was the main reason I bought the Halo, but it becomes redundant because it takes a day to analyze. Then it just tells you the time the conversation happened and for how long, I’m not sure about other people but I can’t even remember what I ate for dinner last night, much less the conversations I had.It scores you based on activity but doesn’t tell you the calories you burned.You have to use the app to access all of this and more. It’s a lot of extra work. Even the cheapest knock off fitbit  take the guess work out of things better than this.It’s also super the band fabric is uncomfortable.",2
1789,I LIKE THAT IT DOESN'T IRRITATE MY ARM. I DON'T LIKE HOW HARD IT IS TO SET UP. I STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SET UP THE VOICE FEATURE. I GET ALMOST THROUGH AND GET A NOTICE THAT I'M SPEAKING TO SOFT. NOPE! I'M SPEAKING IN A QUIET ROOM IN A LOUDER THAN NORMAL VOICE. IF THAT'S TO SOFT THEN HOW WILL IT MONITOR MY SPEAKING VOICE? THAT WAS THE MOST INPORTANT FEATURE FOR ME.,3
1790,"I have had my tracker for about a month and have enjoyed all of the features offered through the app. The unit itself is a bit bulky for my wrist. I have had issues with it rubbing on my wrist bone, creating a bruised feeling. The accuracy of the data seems fairly on point. I would argue that the sleep tracking isn't quite as efficient as I would like, but it offers good insight.",3
1791,Not real impressed with the sleep function.  I don’t feel like it accurately reflects time to fall asleep and other aspects.  Tone burns the battery too quickly and don’t really see a benefit to it.  Heart rate and activity works great.,3
1792,I read reviews but wanted to try it out for myself. I think it worked better at first but now that I’ve had it 5 months I’m not sure if recognizes my workouts anymore. Some weeks I get 200 points some I get 400 but I’m going the same workouts most weeks. Sometimes I get a lot of points for a workout and Sometimes none at all even though I’m sweating through my workouts. Feel like I can’t really trust it’s readings anymore. Not sure why I still wear it. Best part is probably the orange theory hiit classes. The body scanner doesn’t work well either. I lost 30 pounds and continuously told me my body fast was 30% everytime. I don’t both with it anymore. Better off spending a little more money on a Fitbit or whoop.,2
1793,I think it tracks the data well.  Recently the light to let me know it's connected to the charger went out.,4
1794,"Plus -The sleep tracking is actuate.The design is clever in that it allows the bands to be replaced without changing the hardware. This is great recalling the the bands of the Fitbit were its weakest point.Minus -Sneaks in membership.Beware, it doesn't speak about membership fees anywhere prominent. It only told me about it when I connected it on my phone.There is a 6 months trial period after which it will start charging you automatically.The information about membership is hard to find, and it is hard to stop auto renewal (it just says ""contact customer care"").First of all, there shouldn't be a membership fee that is not advertised on product page.Second, if there are features walled behind a fee, they should not be activated without my consent.Third, if they are activated, it shouldn't be set to auto renew without my consent.Fourth if it is activated, you should have a easy way (like a button click) to switch off auto renewal.Fifth it asks me to contact customer care to do that, and I did - but that didn't work either.I am not fond of practices like this.",1
1795,The app jumps around and is not easy to read because of this,2
1796,Think the Halo is pretty good. Enjoy the tone feature but do think it recognizes certain words rather than tone. Because it does not have a screen still have to wear watch. This prefer a different way to wear Halo instead of two bands on arm. Maybe a ring or necklace.,4
1797,"The Halo and App have made me more aware of not only my  activity patterns but sleep pattern.  Offering an insight into how I move and encouraging me to be more active,  The reminders and programs offered are wonderful.",4
1798,The one thing its missing is a visible clock of some kind.,4
1799,"In theory, the Halo is a great simple fitness tracker for someone who doesn't want a smartwatch. It's very user-friendly and seems accurate. However, I have had mine for 8 weeks. I have had to reset it twice, it will frequently lose connection with my phone so my data will not be recorded, and has given me notifications my battery is low when I have just charged it. Only to put it on the charger for 10 minutes and it will correct itself and say it's back to 97% charge. If I was still inside my return window, I would send it back. I think it has potential, but I have experienced too many glitches within the first 8 weeks to think it's worth it.",2
1800,"There isn't an obvious button, and the customer service team has no idea what you're talking about. The band got really dirty, really easily, so I'd go with the sports band.  I liked it for the novelty, but most fitness bands do a better job of tracking these things. If the body scanner and voice tone isn't worth $4 a month for you plus the charge of the band, then it's probably not worth it.",3
1801,"Accumulating goals for the week were great, but if you wanted to check daily progress, I couldn't figure out how to do it. It's comfortable, has a lot more features than I used. I thought I'd be more excited about it, but decided to return it instead.",3
1802,I like the fitness tracker part of the band that tracks your steps.  I love seeing my sleep history but it's not always accurate.  I do wish the actual band was removable so you could wash it. Overall I love the halo.,4
1803,The problem was that I wanted a constant HR trail especially for periods when working out.  At least Halo worked though because I tried a Fitbit and the thing refused to connect to my devices after being paired successfully.  I've given up on fitness trackers for the time being.,3
1804,"I love how there is no screen on the band is very comfortable the sleep information is very detailed I like how your movements are tracked and broke into intensity levels not just ""steps"" as we all know not all steps are beneficial and it really is nice how it takes away points for sedimentary times it really puts your true movement patterns into perspective you can do some intense  activity but a bunch of sitting on your butt can really make that good activity unproductive. The suggestions in the app  for movement and life exercises really feel personalized Really love my halo",5
1805,I got the Halo to try out a fitness tracker. I didn't like that I had to find my phone to see the information from the tracker. I'd rather have a tracker I could look at and see the data. I only found the activity and sleep sections useful. I wasn't interested at all in how my voice/conversation sounds to others. I plan to buy a different style of fitness tracker.,3
1806,I don't like that it doesn't sync with my phone and the fact that it doesn't show the time. I also don't like the fact that the only way you can check any of your data is through the app.  I do like the sleep and voice features.  It is very informative.  I wish there was more data you could track.  I think it has the potential to be an amazing device.,3
1807,Great in all areas except for the sleep tracking,5
1808,First experience with a watch of this sort. Some of the features that it has are not really needed. The voice recognition is a hit or miss. The heart monitor is okay and pretty accurate most of the time. The sleep tracking is another very hit or miss thing. It may or may not track it. I had it on pretty snug and still would lose track mid sleep or not track at all.,3
1809,"Get a Garmin and skip the Halo. The device unpairs often, over-counts steps, doesn't accurately measure sleep and provides useless ""insights"".",2
1810,,5
1811,"I liked the Halo.  The band is comfortable, the tracking is consistent, and the app is easy to use.  What is not as easy is the charging unit, which has been quirky, as other reviewers have note, since the beginning.  But today it no longer worked at all.  I am not even out of my 6 month trial subscription!  I contacted customer service, and was informed they cannot replace the charging unit but they would process a one time return.  With a $15 restocking fee!  I've been a long time Amazon customer, but this is not the kind of service I would have expected for one of their newer products.  I should be able to get more than 5 months from the product.  Too bad.",2
1812,I really liked everything about the Halo band and the app. It was very accurate and was a great reminder to workout or get more sleep. Unfortunately less than six months of owning it it fell apart. I’m passed the time to return it so not much I can do about it now. I’m also not sure if I’m still going to be charged for the mi they membership. When I look that up it says it’s no longer available. Maybe the Halo program wasn’t as successful as Amazon had hoped.,2
1813,"I really wanted to like this product.  I was able to get it early as a Prime member and was very excited.  Unfortunately, the device irritated the skin on my wrist so badly that I just could not wear it.  I had to return it.  For the one night I did wear it, it did not record my sleep accurately at all.  It said I fell asleep hours before I actually did.",3
1814,This has helped me increase my workout.,5
1815,"Great fitness tracker that is easy to use. Being a little OCD, I like that I am not constantly required to look at a screen to see how I am tracking for the day.  So far I am impressed with the body scan and I hope it helps motivate me to lose some more weight.  I also like that it also analysis my tone.  I hope that helps me stay positive and effective when communicating with coworkers and clients.Ps.  Each fitness tracker is uniquely different so I am surprised people would buy a tracker that doesn't fit their needs and then complain it doesn't fit their needs.",5
1816,Although it’s water proof I would suggest completely drying your wrist before wearing it again bc the moisture get trapped underneath and can cause skin discoloration. But the real star is the app that collects the data from the band. It’s amazing. Only wish that it had a clock on it.,4
1817,"Creative and innovative:Apple Watch is always on its charger, My halo is always on my wrist, the battery power is amazing and the tracking ability is top-notch. I literally capture every single thing I do during the day. 30,000 steps a day is not Anything that was happening before I got my halo, after wearing my halo and tracking every single thing I was doing during the day it appeared and I was taken aback. Thank you Amazon for coming up with a great product very motivating",5
1818,"I like the look and the fitting of the Halo.  It is comfortable and charges quickly.I don't like that it is difficult to repeat some of the workouts.  Once you do them, very difficult to find them again.The sleep function is very inaccurate.",3
1819,"Maybe I'm missing something here, but it's just not impressive and doesn't do much at all... Basically if you use the one unique feature (tracking your tone) you need to charge the battery TWICE A DAY.  REALLY??  Besides that it tracks activity and sleep. I feel like this is decent for tracking my sleep - but it is pretty inaccurate about my activity so I'm not sure I trust the sleep tracker.  I'm not interested in the apps that it partners with - it feels like a gimmick to sell me more stuff. No thanks.Update!!  After 7 weeks of use, it no longer works AT ALL... doesn’t pair with the app anymore, so if it is tracking my activity or my sleep at this point it’s not reporting it back to me. Completely useless. Returning for refund. What a waste of time.",2
1820,"Had really high hopes for the Amazon Halo, but it's really underwhelming. App is extremely cluttered and unhelpful. Band is uncomfortable and so far I haven't seen any additional benefit that I didn't have with Fitbit, except for the fact loss measurement which is done on the app and doesn't rely at all on the band. I really hope Amazon improves this experience, otherwise I won't be renewing my subscription when the 6-month included membership is up.",3
1821,The only thing I don't like about it is it's uncomfortable.  I have small wrists so I ordered small band but it rubs against bone on outside of my wrists (I have tried both wrists). Not sure if larger band would make a difference.,4
1822,"When it pairs it works pretty good.  Sometimes has trouble updating data, and unpairs itself from the Bluetooth. When it works it is impressive, but quite frustrating when it doesn't work.  In my opinion, there are better options out there.",3
1823,"I bought this as a possible replacement for the Whoop.  Sleep and activity tracker work well.  Tone is very questionable and I ultimately turned tone off due to battery consumption. I really want a device that will track HRV for recovery purposes.  The HALO should be able to.  Would love to see this added.  Otherwise , I still prefer the Whoop (just too expensive for me).",3
1824,"This is my first experience with this kind of fitness product so maybe I didn’t like it for reasons that can’t be changed, but all the same I didn’t like this product. Number one reason is battery life. Be prepared to charge daily. Also I have no actual evidence to super reason 2, other than the way I felt, but I don’t think it is very accurate. For the sleep function i would have nights were I slept great and check to find I scored a 50, and then other nights would toss and turn and wake up tired to find I had a score in high 70s. Anytime I got a “great” score I did agree I slept great though.The activity part didn’t seem accurate either. A .3 mile walk from my car to work would give me just as many points as an hour of lifting weights at the gym.",2
1825,"Compared to the whoop, this is a solid replacement. It tracks most everything i want and at a better price point. One major suggestion i have for people that want long battery life is to not activate tone. I didn’t and im on day 3 and battery life is at 63%.",4
1826,The band was stylish overall and comfortable. A bit hard to put on and remove. My first test of it I did a HIIT workout with kettlebell swings and my heart rate off the chart. The app showed that I was essentially at rest. WTH? IT gave me 3 points for a 30 min High intensity workout.....Ok. I could reach my weekly goal at that pace if I ran do a different state. The body scan showed a 27% bodyfat when I just got scanned at my Drs office on a 4k Inbody machine just 2 mos ago and was 12%BF. This could be dangerous for some and certainly demotivating. Good thing I know better. I really wanted it to work but perhaps will wait for a few generations in the future for them to hear out all the complaints and returns. Lesson learned..........Never buy the 1st Gen of anything.,2
1827,"I purchased this hoping for a Whoop alternative, but was disappointed by the lack of data. It's great for basic fitness and sleep tracking, but definitely not something I'll be paying $4/month for.Overall Fit - pretty comfortable, it's light and I honestly forget I'm wearing it. Easy to sleep with it on.Sleep tracking - It's a great sleep tracker, seems very accurate and it's interesting to see how long I actually sleep for. Its really the only feature I like on this trackerBMI - seems pretty accurate, but I've had trouble getting scans to syncTone - haven't tried this feature as I hear it really cuts down on battery lifeFitness tracking - this is where I was disappointed. It generates a score based on minutes active.  Add points when active, subtracts when inactive. It's fine I guess, but I'd like more data.",2
1828,My reactions after a week of use:Pros:Frequent *heartrate monitoring* instead of the typical intermittent activity-driven monitoring that polls my heartrate every 5 minutes or so.*Sleep score* is incredibly accurate. It quantifies something so important to my health.*TONE* is game changing!!iOS App is simple to use and has an intuitive dashboard.Cons:Due to its smaller size it's not as comfortable as the Apple Watch that sits on my other wrist. I hope this gets looked at in a future version.I forgot how to use the button and am glad the instructions were in the box. Perhaps a reminder in the app would be good.,5
1829,I love the idea of the Halo Band. I wish it used the circles like the Apple Watch. The battery life didn't last long enough to be to be able to use it all day and night without charging it somewhere in between.,3
1830,Band is comfortable to wear and easy to take off and put on. The Halo app is average and definitely not worth a monthly subscription. The charger design is awful! The band needs to be set perfect on the charger for it to connect. The charger design is like a bag clip that clips onto the band. After my six month free subscription is up this is going in the never to be seen again bin.,3
1831,"I wanted to like halo, but the user experience is just too clunky. Tracking activities is hit or miss, it's hard to edit or adjust them, and there just isn't enough tracking detail. Body comp analysis seems really light and weak. Also can't adjust sleep tracking for your preferences",3
1832,I dislike the fact that the device does not sit on your wrist comfortably.  You also run the risk of resetting the device if you touch the button indaverdantly.  I have had to rest the device twice now.Overall I like th3e functions of what it can do.,4
1833,Love the band more than View,5
1834,"I’ve only been wearing it for 36ish hours but thought I’d chime in with a HUGE plus! I’m a knitter, crocheter and all around crafter. The issue I’ve had with every kind of tracker I’ve used before (mostly Fitbit and Apple Watch) is they count every stitch I make as a step...so I’ll sit down to watch a movie and knit and suddenly it shows I’ve walked three miles.  Yeah...the halo doesn’t appear to have this major flaw! I also like the voice tone feature, it seems to be pretty accurate thus far! (I haven’t set up the body scan thing yet, I had to save something for another day!)",5
1835,The band gets dirty quick so I would recommend a rubber style one. How accurate it is I don’t know to be honest with you. And body composition is interesting but I love the exercise applications that they suggest. Voice analysis is so random not a huge fan of that.,4
1836,"I love nearly everything about the Halo! It keeps me accountable to my health goals that I set for myself, reminds me daily to do the exercises it chose for me based on my individual body scan,  and syncs directly to my weight watchers app. I do have to take it off to charge every other day which is a bit annoying, but it charges pretty fast. Also, I wish interchangeable bands were a bit cheaper.  Overall it is a great investment!",5
1837,"I decided to try this as I have had issues with my sleep. And it is providing me with the information that I wanted.  I really like the product.  It has a long battery charge life as well.  I do have an Apple watch, but thought it was difficult for me to figure out how to use it for my sleep, plus it is my habit to charge my Apple watch when I sleep.  The Halo also gives information to help you get better sleep.  I also use it for my activity level, the tone of my voice, and the body composition.",5
1838,I’m on the fence with this.It’s comfortable to wear and about as accurate as my Garmin.There is no read out except the app; and I knew that going in.The app is pretty good. Could use a little some improvement. It measures steps.I want miles. It doesn’t show how many miles in a trip for me.I like it. Just don’t love it yet.,3
1839,"If you need a watch to tell you how well you slept, then this is a good tool. There are other items that will do more for you when it comes to fitness.  The Halo membership has lots of exercise programs, but I have a hard time following an exercise class on a 4"" screen. There is currently no way to watch these on a laptop.  I did a quick morning stretch one day and couldn't find it again.  There are also no notifications to let you know when to move on to the next stretch, so you have to stop and look at the phone.  I thought the tone feature would be helpful, but found it to not be very accurate, so I shut it off as it drains the battery.  I find the screens confusing.  I'm shopping for something else.",2
1840,"I’ve had the halo for a few weeks now and I’m not impressed. The device did irritate my wrist (one cut/one scratch). After a few weeks it stopped syncing with the app. I sent an email for help and am awaiting a response. Honestly, I wish I could return it as it doesn’t compare to the $20 tracker that I bought last July that’s still working perfectly. The only thing that the halo does better is the sleep tracking. It doesn’t hold a charge as I had to charge every morning. The charger is a bit finicky because it takes several adjustments to get the halo aligned just right so that it starts charging. For the price, it could be a lot better and provide more info like blood pressure, pulse, etc. I would also agree with other reviewers that the activity scores are very random and demotivating.",2
1841,I like this product for its aesthetic and it does what it’s supposed to. I won’t be using the “tone” feature so I almost wonder if I should’ve gone with a different product. It does kinda stick to your arm so I wonder if it’ll be uncomfortable in the Summer.,4
1842,Had this less than a day and the rose gold material already has a nasty black smudge on it. Cheaply made but I guess I should have expected that.,2
1843,I have had this Amazon halo 3 months . I love it so much! Only time I take off is to shower . It does everything it’s supposed to . Grant  it I bought the sport band . The one that comes with it is not comfortable . You will love it I am sure as much as me . I got rid of my fit bit months before so got this last Oct 2020. I don’t need a face to look at . I am a nurse so this is perfect hooks to the app love the challenges you can do with the Halo and the app,5
1844,"I'm an avid hiker, and I loved this thing....until I took it to the mountains.1) it's supposed to sync via Bluetooth, but won't sync in the app without an internet connection. So, I can do 10 miles and still only see 50 steps and 1 point, until I get back to a signal, several hours later. Frustrating. I even seemed to be tracking my live heartrate via Bluetooth, but not my steps. I don't understand that.2) I got synced at 21,000 steps once back to a signal, but took a very bumpy forest road driving home, which added 4000 ""steps"" to my total. So I really don't know how many steps I have. I can't rely on data for setting personal records/achievements, because it can be flawed differently, based even on my driving route, or where I choose to go hike.  It has been beneficial for tracking my sleep. But, I would say that it has failed at tracking MY physical activity.UPDATE:I moved the Halo to my non steering wrist, and the band cut me twice while using a hiking pole.So, on top of the electronics shortcomings, the band is thin, rigid, and coarse.....cheap.This thing is crappy. Save your money, y'all.",1
1845,"Love love this! It has been so encouraging. I was thrilled to learn I'm actually more active then I thought. Sometimes it will be a little inaccurate and I have to reinstall the app. The customer service when I did have some issues was wonderful. I love the tone tracking but only use it once in a while to check in on myself. Tone feature does drain the battery. I like seeing the individual break down of my sleep though the time getting to sleep is never right. I must move around to much. Been so encouraging, love it! I love the low profile and that there is no screen.",5
1846,The straps were so bad that it fell off my wrist last night. I hadn't even wore it for past month or so. I decided to get back and it just fell off. The straps were always a problem. I should've returned when I had the chance.,2
1847,"I found that I actually live this device! I have had multiple fitness tracking bands before, and this one was the most accurate and unique one yet! I love all the features I get with this device and the fact that its so light i can barely tell its there! Great job amazon! This device is amazing! I will say the only suggestion I have is to maybe have at least a way to tell time... I understand that was not the intention with this device but for me it was replacing my Samsung galaxy watch 3 and I have to constantly pull out my phone to check the time!",5
1848,"Nice for tracking sleep and fitness, but that's all it does. I have other products that track my sleep and fitness, but also have an option to have a silent alarm in the mornings. If this product did that, I would use it 100%. As it is right now, it just doesn't offer any major advantages over other watch products.Hopefully, they will update it in the future to have more capabilities.",3
1849,"I really like my Halo. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and it really provides me eith information and resources for a healthier lifestyle.Of course it is limited to the described product information. If you want a do-it-all capability device, then get a iWatch. I’m very pleased with the product. It is very light and comfortable to wear. Got the small one and fits me perfectly. Also the sleep tracking and tone analysis is super accurate.  The activity needs to be recorded manually sometimes. The only downside I find is the battery life when the tone analyzer is activated.  Overall, I recommend this product.",5
1850,Love this productHeart rate when working outActivity score keeps you activeNo one has a better body composition analysis,5
1851,I mainly got this to measure my sleep and my workouts.  The calorie counting and sleep tracking have been beneficial and eye opening to what I thought I was getting.  Will definitely continue to use this to help keep me active and continue to track my sleep patterns.,4
1852,"Amazing for workout tracking and sleep tracking. I would say it's pretty accurate for tone tracking but it's hard to tell. The body scan is surprisingly accurate. I do a body composition scan at my local nutrition shop and they are exactly the same by using the 360 scan on the halo app. Very impressed. Battery life has been great and only charge every couple days. I love the insights on the app and the habit trackers to help improve sleep, exercise, etc. Band is very comfortable. I have a very small wrist so it's sometimes difficult for watches to fit and also be comfortable.",5
1853,"Weight Watchers was gifting this device to selected members.  Sleeo tracking did not flow through to the Weight Watchers App.  Activity tracking on the device did not always come up auutomatically.  Usually, the refresh on the weight watchers app broght current information.  Activities categorized on the Halo app didn't track to the Weight Watchers app.  Activities on the Halo App are sports minded.",3
1854,"I’m fairly pleased with this, but the BMI assessment is garbage. Sorry. I had a body comp analysis at my doctors office and it was completely off. On the Halo, one week my BMI jumped to 10+ points. Not possible, and completely incorrect.",3
1855,"I'm not a fan of the passive how do I sound to others feature.  It's a trust issue with apps and devices.  Yes you can turn the mic off, but doesn't have a dedicated mechanical switch.  Fine around family I suppose, but not during meetings.",4
1856,"Purchased Jan 8 2021. It's now March 7th and I have to recharging the battery daily. I do not use the tone option after initially trying it, I'm neutral majority of the time, because of battery drain. It started off charging every 2 or 3 days and as of today it is now less than 24hrs. It was charged yesterday morning around 11am and it shut off due to  low battery last night around 10:30pm while I slept.Update: On March 8th Amazon called me and after trouble shooting over the phone offered to send me a new (refurbished) unit. It arrived on March 10th. On initial charge it lasted about 36hrs. Since then it has been decreasing and as of today March 23rd a charge lasts from 10 to 14 hours.I do not recommend the HALO.",2
1857,"Initially I liked the Amazon Halo, bought especially as it seemed to be lighter weight than other fitness trackers that are worn on the wrist and liked the screen free. Aside from that I bought for the sleep tracking and it seemed at first to do a decent job tracking my sleep but then more and more nights didn't register. Tone of voice feature drains the battery so you have to charge daily. Then I started having tiny black flecks come off the back, then the back fell off (see pics). As I mainly only wear for sleep and its supposedly swimproof so if I can't wear it daily with only being exposed to a quick handwashing I don't find this encouraging of it lasting so it is being returned. Had high hopes and if Amazon improves would try again but am not happy with current product.",2
1858,I sold my smart watch because I felt it was always on a charger. I wanted a fitness tracker only. Halo is perfect for me. My only dislikes would be that naps aren't recorded and amount of time to fall asleep can be a bit off. I like  that instead of focusing on steps the focus is on activity. The scan feature can be a bit of an eye opener and will keep you out of the kitchen. I haven't used the workout programs because I am using a different exercise program at  this time.  Maybe later for that feature. Overall pleased,5
1859,"I got in early hoping it would be nice to wear with my actual mechanical watch because it doesn't have a face. The app does not connect to much of anything to share data, so I had to manually enter that into my work's wellness program. It was uncomfortable on my wrist, and the options for bands is abysmally low. The body composition does not take into account actual body composition, so that was useless compared to the machines at the gym, which actually measure that, so it was about as accurate as BMI, which I could have calculated myself without an expensive gadget. I tried it too long so I can't return it, and Amazon won't even let me sell it to someone who will like it on this site.",2
1860,I really like this. I was lucky enough to get one of these on the early release and find it very helpful.The only consMine (perhaps being the first model) doesn't seem 100% accurate on sleep. I'll go to bed at 9:00 and the app will show I fell asleep at 11:00 or 12:00. It's otherwise accurate and records my sleep interruptions and when I wake up.The body scanner took a half dozen tries in different lighting to get right. It's a pretty cool feature which according to online reviews over estimates body fat but still provides great guidance.I otherwise love this.,5
1861,"I don't feel the readings on this are accurate.  The vocal tone doesn't give you any information that's helpful, as it just gives ""impressions"" of your tone and not specifics.  The sleep feature doesn't seem accurate either - don't you think I'd know if I was awake for a two hour stretch in the middle of the night?  Overall, I'm just not sold on this product.",3
1862,Best tracker/sleep monitor I've used,5
1863,"It took a week for the heart rate to get accurate, but now it works great. Works with Peloton too!",5
1864,"Tired of constantly factory resetting because it disconnects from my phone. I try to re-pair it and it doesn't work, so I factory reset it. Not pleased with product",2
1865,"Overall, not a bad device! It’s tone analysis isn’t the best, though. Frequently registers my normal tone of voice as negative - even when talking about things like what to have for dinner. Wish it had more advanced capabilities like learning about your normal habits to determine voice tone.I mostly use it for the sleep tracking function. Doesn’t provide super helpful information, but is fun to use.",3
1866,"Pretty consistent with my fitbit as far as tracking goes. I like the body mass readings. However even with the tone off battery life is horrible.  I was going to return it, but I just missed my window.",3
1867,"Amazon Halo is fantastic! Easy to set up and use, the more data it has, the better it tracks your progress. Halo uses intensity for exercise which is very useful to track and compare points given for each activity. Tone is excellent, spot on, even when singing! Tone teaches how to adjust what you sound like to others, to better portray how you want people to ""see"" you. Sleep tracking improves sleep habits. Halo has labs, suggestions, and easy to use data to improve your sleep, fitness, and how you sound to others. It actually helps to improve all aspects, not just track them. I love it!!",5
1868,Loved it at first. Now app doesn't sync and bulb has burned my wrist over and over. Wanted a replacement but too late and no contact info. Boo.,3
1869,I love the halo. I first purchased it about 3 months ago when I was a beta tester. I was very interested to hear how I sounded to others. Apparently I’m quite a nice guy. But I was really surprised by the sleep measuring function. My sleeps are not good. I rarely get a score above 20% quality and explains why I am so tired all the time. The halo device has labs that will help me improve my sleep quality and look forward to using it. It’s not a I-fit per say but it has many redeeming quality’s. For the price I suggest every one gets one.,5
1870,"Overall, the device is very useful for tracking activity. However, the sleep function I believe needs to work on the scale since I have had some terrible nights sleeping and some good nights sleeping and have never gotten below a 70 sleep score.",4
1871,"The only thing that made me return the halo, twice, the clip to recharge the watch didn’t last. Faulty, frustrating, disappointed",4
1872,"I'd love to give this a 5 star review, and had it worked for longer than about 3 months I would have. It stopped charging after a while and even after ordering a new charger it still wouldn't work so I had to send it back. It was great while it worked though. Labs were helpful, sleep tracker was accurate and step counter was perfect.",3
1873,This band totally depends on the app and your phone. You can't see any readings without checking your phone.,2
1874,I feel like that stats that it says it keeps up with are incorrect. I use two other types of devices to keep up with all of my fitness and health and both of them are somewhat even with everything yet this halo says something completely different than them.,3
1875,"Sleep tracking is greatNot a huge fan of the tone analytics. Eats up battery and there is really no incremental insight! I used for a week and turned it offBody scan is good, not sure if it’s accurateActivity tracking is kinda OK.. works for steps.. so if you run or work out on the elliptical you get more points... but doesn’t give you any points for lifting weights  etc..",3
1876,"Yes, every time I shampoo it gives me credit for walking over a thousand steps.  So the accuracy leaves an incredible amount to be desired.It penalizes for being sedentary.  Points for intense workouts will be lowered if you, say, sit down sometime in the day.  Heaven help you if you have a desk job.Sleep results are fairly inaccurate.  It shows me awake for significant periods of time when I know I was sleeping soundly with only occasional wakefulness.  (I need to turn over occasionally.)  When I got up in the middle of the night and was dubbing around on my computer and the kitchen for several hours, it counted much of the time as asleep.Perhaps I got a lemon.  However, it isn't worth my time to exchange it only to find the same issues.",2
1877,I really liked it when it worked. It’s a bit difficult to get on the charger correctly- that needs to be corrected. My husband had a Fitbit and it didn’t last a year so he was thinking of getting the Halo instead and I proudly told him I have had no issues (unlike the bad reviews that said it didn’t last ) and suggested he get one. One week later I went for a swim in it and it’s now dead. The back cover is apparently only attached with a small amount of glue that doesn’t hold - even though it’s supposed to be water proof. What a waste. The concept is great but the actual product is cheaply made if it doesn’t even last 6 months. Disappointed and irritated.,2
1878,"Exercise tracking seems to measure physical effort very well...the higher in you HR zone you work, the more points you earn.  It is NOT hard to reach or exceed the recommended weekly point goal!  Health matters and that is what I was looking for.Sleep tracking is very accurate...tracks REM and deep sleep, also.  Only thing missing is the ability to sense a nap.  Hoping this feature comes later.Within the app, there are good, short videos offering tips on creating effective sleep habits, healthy eating, and all levels of exercise/activity.Worth the money and worth the monthly subscription fee!",5
1879,Liked the sleep and activity tracking.  Didn't use the bmi or voice tone.  Ultimately returning this and decided to upgrade my apple watch (I had the original version for 5 years) for the upgraded sleep and activity tracking so I wouldn't have something on both wrists.,4
1880,"If your one that needs coaching to get your butt off the couch, this product may be for you. I work and have been an essential worker all through the pandemic, and using the Halo and wearing to work where everyone is already stressed out, the Halo told me I was being too negative and that I dismissed people too easily. I'm sorry, but my job requires me to keep moving, so a quick Hello to fellow employees is all I have time for. I don't need coaching to get moving, nor am I grumpy. The world needs more nice people, and this Halo tracker made me aware of that. I did not like the app, seemed like it needed some bugs fixed and is not suited for just any audience. Product was returned a week after testing it out. Just not for me.",2
1881,This is a great fitness tracker. I like that it is so detailed and it also includes workout videos which are free now and 3.99 after 6 months. For me it is a deal since I don’t use the gym and other apps such as Daily Burn are around 20 dollars a month.My only complaint is that it does not sync up with Noom. I don’t mind that you have to open the app to see how many steps you took throughout the day. The syncing has not been a problem for me at all. If you are looking to improve your overall health I would recommend this device.,5
1882,"I wore my Fitbit and the Halo for months to compare them. The Halo didn't even come close in terms of performance, utility, or motivation.I was very open to the possibility that in exchange for turning over a bunch of data to Amazon, I'd be amazed and motivated by this new device and app. I was wrong, it is purely a data grab without meaningful benefit to the user.📌 Painfully uncomfortable📌 Ugly as the day is long📌 Doesn't properly track sleep if you get up during the night📌 Sporadically tracks activity📌 The tone function is useless (ditto for the body mass images)📌 Audio cues on workout videos stopped working📌 No useful integrations📌 AND IT TAKES UP REAL ESTATE ON MY WRIST BUT DOESN'T EVEN DISPLAY THE TIME (what a colossal miss)",2
1883,"My halo was a spontaneous purchase during the prime days. I have two teenagers who tell me I sound grumpy; I knew that couldn’t possibly be true!  Now I have two slightly annoyed teenagers who know their mom is happy almost all the time.  More importantly though, I love the feedback for exercise and sleep quality.  I am more motivated now to squeeze in a quick workout even if I’m short on time. I’m also getting to bed at a decent hour.  Everyone wins!",5
1884,"Sleep tracking is about 75-80% accurate on my case. Activity tracker is on the spot. Comfortable to wear and I have a small wrist, do not need to be super tight. Fabric band needs to be washed every so often or it would hold moisture and become malodorous.",4
1885,"Would be nice if I didn't have to wear my old watch. But this watch tells time and checks my bp, tracks my steps and logs sleep and even 02 blood saturation levels. Needs a face, with data. It doesn't prevent me from using my phone as often as I want",3
1886,Could be a great product but it is a pain in the ass to charge. It takes multiple tries to get it to connect. I stopped using it because of this. I used it for a week before giving up. I was able to charge 2 times and then it it stopped connecting to the charger.,3
1887,Great app and great band,5
1888,i wear 3 trackers to sleep Fitbit and amazfit and this thing! The other 2 give me an average of about 30 minutes difference in time slept so if I sleep 7 hours I will get 7 hours on Fitbit 7 or 6hours and 45 minutes on the other. this thing will say I slept only 3 hours or 4 hours and gives me a horrible score totally worthless,3
1889,I really like this device.  It is very accurate.  I wish the battery would last at least five days.  I believe it lasts three days .  But It chargers very fast.  The cloth strap is very comfortable.,4
1890,I liked it a lot at first but now I've had it 2 months and the battery dies in less than 24 hours even with the tone feature turned off. it used to last about 3 days. I'm outside of my return window so I'm kinda stuck with it at this point.,3
1891,"Pros: it's comfortable! I can wear it all day and night with no issues. It tracks my steps and (actual) ""activity"" pretty well. It roughly tracks sleep.Cons: the sedentary time tracking is inaccurate and crap. For example, last night I was in bed 11pm-7am. It counted 11-12, 12-1:45, and 6-7 as sedentary. So I lost a point for yesterday and fresh out of bed had 2:45 sedentary. Guess what Amazon - you don't fall asleep immediately when in bed; and if you wake up in the middle of the night, you're not going to jump up and go for a run! You're going to try to go back to sleep. That renders the point system and therefor the whole basis of its ""fitness"" tracking wrong and useless.",2
1892,"The Halo has been good for the beginning of my fiancée's fitness journey. It's helped keep her motivated to move on a consistent basis and understand what is and isn't beneficial in regards to either cardio or weight training. She hasn't used the sleep tracking function much because she hates sleeping with things on her wrist so I can't provide much feedback on that unfortunately. However, she does really enjoy the body scan component and being able to see a rendering of what she'd look like at different body fat percentages.",5
1893,"ok for tracking activity, though not enough detail available in my opinion. sleep is definitely not accurate, though does give general sense of sleep stages and length. Annoying that you have to be constantly subscribed to be able to use anything beyond step tracker which is available on any phone.Most disappointing is that less than a year since I bought it, it has stopped working. randomly. I woke up and it was dead. recharging did not help. now it just flashes for a few secs and then turns off.",2
1894,"I liked the feel of the product and its simplicity, but it just didn't do it for me. The sleep analysis said I was sleeping 2 hours a night (obviously not true). The points system was giving me random spikes in points for no change in effort. For example, I might walk for 20 minutes. Randomly, 2-3 of those minutes would give me points as if I was running. I am in shape, and my heart rate is constant, so I am not sure what was happening. Finally - I hated wearing the watch and not at least having the time. Seeing a watch on your wrist just draws you to look at it, but there is nothing there. I knew this going into the purchase, but I thought I could get past it.  For these reasons, I returned a product for the first time to Amazon.",2
1895,"Update: The back of the optical sensor cover broke off after 11 months of normal use.  While it's suppose to be swimproof; water resistant to 50M but I did not use it to swim, shower, etc.  Amazon replaced with a refurbished device and it broke off again in less than 5 months.  Cannot believe Amazon made such cheap device and selling for that price.Decided not to renew the membership but the tracker became just a step counter.  Without $3.99/month membership, this $99 Amazon Halo became a step counter compares to other basic $30 fitness trackers can track activities, sleep stages, pulse oximetry and many more.  I called Amazon Halo customer service months ago asking what happened without monthly membership, they said functions should remain the same except some labs, tone, and body which I don't use.  Well, now it's just a faceless fancy step counter.  Amazon Halo should not remove basic fitness tracker function which is an industry standard to force customers paying monthly fee.  Luring customers with 6 month free membership then stop basic fitness tracker function is bait and switch.  Grossly disappointed!!!",1
1896,Great health tracking app. Sleep tracking sometimes lags and doesn't pick up all activities but overall a good product. Much more cost effective compared to woop,4
1897,"I am so sorry I wasted my money on this device.  Today, I walked up and down hills in my neighborhood for an hour and Halo counted that as 4 points.  Yesterday, I wound yarn, while sitting down, for 30 minutes, and Halo gave me 30 points for that one.  I have only burned 1600 calories all week!  Really?  It also subtracts points based on some mysterious calculation.  Nope, nope, nope.",1
1898,"I don’t like that there is no clock, nor is it compatible with Apple Health. I understand that it is an Amazon product, but I’m not going to give up my iPhone to have the halo be compatible with my health app. I do like the sleep tracking and the tone feature, as well as the body scan! I wish there were more that I could do with it though.",3
1899,"Pros: Fun app to look at. Uploading your picture is fun and you can play with Body Fat visually; however, this is the only reason I would keep it. Wish the scan function was available without the band.Cons: Like other reviewers, the band bruises your wrist. Not sure the points feature vs step tracker is value added to someone who is really into fitness. It's like playing a game to get your ring complete. The sleep tracker is nice, but again, like a fun game to watch, not really adding any fitness value to my life. The return window is very short. It took me a month to figure out if I like it, but now w/in that month the window is closed to return it. Watch the reviews first and see if this is for you.",2
1900,"This is the perfect tracker for someone who doesn't want anything too complicated or with too many options to use on one device.  This tracker is not full of too many options or gadgets you need to keep up with. It is just enough to keep you motivated to feel better!  The labs are amazing, there are beginner levels up to intermediate. You can chose a 2 minute stretch or a 45 minute workout.  They have bedtime sleep labs to help you relax and fall asleep faster, mindfulness labs and nutrition labs.  All challenges that you can chose to accept and/or try.",5
1901,"Why not a simple clock in it, as I am carrying whole day long and it is visible in my wrist? Why not a simple body (wrist) temperature changing indicator in the band that will help when I do excecis? Why not a pulse border line setup, so that the band will indicate when my pulse reach that limit? Oxygen saturation ?",3
1902,Day 1: the sleep tracker is pretty good. But the most basic function today is step count and it doesn’t get that right! I have ordered 4 for the family and disappointed if it won’t work. We wanted a faceless less distracting wearable. Can customer service help?,1
1903,"The first three week were great. The fitness programs offered are designed for the more agile, so I stick with the walking programs. The app isn’t staying open after 3 weeks of usage. If there is an update I can’t access it.",4
1904,I am having a love-hate relationship with my Halo. I love the data and information it is giving me but hating the poor battery life. I am finding I am getting only about 30-34 hours of battery life before needing to be recharged for several hours. I am avoiding syncing thinking that this was the issue....it wasn’t. My Fitbit usually gets 48-56 hours before recharge but produces far less useful data.,3
1905,"Your goal is the same as everyone else's... you are given points based on your activity and the goal is to get 150 points by weeks end.  It doesn't track food intake or macros and it is not compatible with any apps that do.  If you aren't concerned with that aspect then this will be fine.  If you are maniacal about tracking everything,  get a fitbit.",3
1906,"Amazon did great with this entry into the this space! Sleep tracking was a main draw for me to this product as I could never get my Apple Watch to track properly. The body comp tool is super cool, no one can deny that. I agree integration with other apps will be cool but I’m sure that will come; the built in on demand guided classes/tips are awesome (no excuses). The minimalist look and feel is perfect for those that want the concentrated functions to move towards wellness (inside and out). I’ll still wear my Apple Watch on the other hand and I’m fine with that.",5
1907,"All the tracking features are adequate. It does what it says it does. My main complaint is that device is just too uncomfortable. It's difficult to get the fit right for during the day. Its either too snug and hurts, or too loose and moves around too much and the heart rate sensor doesnt work. Even if you do find the sweet spot, it's still so bulky that it's not comfortable to sleep with. I would think that for a tracker without a display, they could get the form factor more comfortable.Update: to be more specific, the part that houses the hardware just seems too thick and bulky, and the shape and size of the side that contacts your arm just doesn't feel right.  Maybe it's more comfortable with the sports band compared to the fabric band?",2
1908,Title says it all,5
1909,"I like the product, but the wristband loses its color pretty quick. I got the pink one, and it is not as bright as it was when I opened it.",4
1910,"I’m very disappointed with the way the Halo wears. I purchased the gold option about 10 months ago, the color is scraping off. Not sure that I would want to try again or have an item that lasts less than a year.",3
1911,Sleep tracking is awesome! Battery life is awful with the voice tracking on though so I keep it off now and it's sad because it's such a cool feature. I wish there was at least some sort of screen or LED indicator on the band itself so that I can tell the battery percentage without needing to check the app.,3
1912,"We purchased this during the preview for $64.99 in October 2020. By the middle of December, with light use, the charger would not connect, which made it unusable. We called Amazon, and were told they could not send us a replacement or a new charging cable. They would only offer us a refund.HOWEVER, the price of the Halo had gone up to $99. So the refund was not enough to purchase a replacement.  We decided we didn’t want to pay $35 MORE than we had originally to purchase another device. We didn’t want to take the chance on another Halo when the first one stopped working after only 2 months. We were really excited about this and the whole situation was really disappointing.I’m usually very happy with Amazon support, but this time they really dropped the ball.",2
1913,"Very mediocre. Activity recognition is not good. Plus when you put in an activity manually, it chooses if you did light, moderate, or intense activity. And sometimes it doesn’t make sense, so you have to choose another activity to trick it into what is accurate. Heart rate monitoring is poor. I easily get up to 180 during spin class, but it will only register at 110, even if I turn on the live mode. The tone of voice thing is a waste. Also, it won’t work with Apple health. I have worn it every day for about six months. My free trial of the membership is ending, and I’ll be buying a different tracker. This is not worth the money, or the time trying it out.",2
1914,"Excellent experience for almost a year now. Best fitness band that doesn't add any excess distraction like most fitness watches. Very accurate, updated technology that offers health and fitness services without the extra cost all the other fitness watches, bands trick you into. Very simple, easy to use yet offers more health and wellness benefits than any other fitness bands. Most bang for your buck. Haven't had any technical issues since I purchased about a year ago.",5
1915,"Update: still using in hopes that updates help... still junk. I'm done with this.To me the Halo has two main functions that I'm really interested in (actually, the only things it really does): the body scan and the HR monitor that detects intensity.The only problem is only half of these works. The HR monitor is so widely inaccurate that it's becoming frustrating. I can do a solid hour of HIIT and weight training and it shows that I barely ever reach 100 BPM. Where I measured my HR using 3 other instruments each showed roughly the same BPM at ~145.Reading the Amazon help it says ""Try to avoid clenching your fist during functional fitness and weightlifting workouts since that can lead to inaccurate heart rate values.""Kinda hard to do when you're lifting a bar or dumbbells. I also have noticed this on pull-ups and pushups... basically, whenever there's any pressure on my hands or wrist it is completely worthless. So I guess it's only good for running and other cardio?Yes, I've tried many different positions, tightness, and have worn it in both wrist with the same frustrating results. Hopefully, they have a big update soon or these are going back. But I fear this is a hardware issue over software.",1
1916,"I previously had a fitbit and when I lost it, I saw the Halo and thought I would give it a try! I love it is it more of an overall health tool, I can link it to my WW account, there are a lot of workouts available and the ability to setup reminders for different routines. I currently have one set up to track my water intake, stretching exercises and a workout. It has a unique item in the wristband where it registers your voice and periodically measures your tone of voice. It is interesting to see how it registers your emotions. Highly recommend.",5
1917,"I like the battery on this, but it definitely causes arm irritating if you leave it on for however long the battery lasts. I take it off every other day to sleep to give my skin some space.",4
1918,"I would have giving a greater star review, the sleep tracking and the sleep stage and quality reporting does not always show in the app. Really depressing since that was one of the fetures I bought this for! Really sad, thats what may rating is for!",3
1919,"I actually love this so much. It makes me want to move better, eat better and just overall do better. But the battery does not last 2 days",4
1920,This was great for 3 months. About a month in it started having charging issues. Then it completely died today. Of course it’s out of warranty .  Thankfully the Amazon team contacted me and are sending another Halo.  I would give it five stars - but only if this one lasts at least a year!,3
1921,"About 6 months after I bought it, it stopped tracking my sleep. It has started tracking it again, but inconsistently. I woke at about 4am, used the bathroom, went back to sleep for a few hours, and it failed to track any of the sleep after 4. Worse, it considered those hours to be sedentary, making my activity score inaccurate as well. Not happy.Update: this thing is really pissing me off. It shows that I didn't sleep at all last night, thus starting my sedentary hours at midnight. I have more sedentary hours in my activity score than hours I've been awake, despite two workout sessions, so I have to do my own calculations. I'm going to stop wearing it at night, but I don't know if that will help. It's basically nothing more than an overblown pedometer at this point.When I first lowered my rating ""stars"" a few weeks ago, I received an email from someone at Amazon who said he wanted to discuss the issue; he asked me to respond to his email. I did, and got a notification that the address could not receive emails. Great. So I sent a message to customer service, and have heard nothing back.",1
1922,"I love the Amazon Halo. It is great at tracking my sleep and my steps and activity throughout the day. I have yet to try to the tone capability, as this is not important to me. I did the body scan-it is really cool. I look forward to seeing how it all works out as I try to lose weight this year. Overall if you are looking for an easy activity and sleep tracker without any bells and whistles-this is for you!! I just wish there was a way to set a silent alarm through it, but not a huge deal breaker for me.",5
1923,"I like it,",5
1924,"I have had this since last November as I was one of the people selected to beta test it it’s never been able track my heart rate accurately. I’m a physician, I know how to accurately take my own heart rate and the Halo band is consistently lower than my actual heart rate (which likely explains other users frustrations with it not giving enough “points” to physical activities).Sleep tracking is equally inaccurate at least once a week it tells me I went to bed and hour or more after I actually did.  My sleep scores suck even when I get restful sleep with minimal awakenings.AND, since I’ve owned it, less than a year, I have to factory reset it THREE TIMES to get it to pair with my phone. Each time it refused to pair with my phone despite all the not so helpful directions from Amazon on how to get it to sync back up when this happens.I love Amazon as a company and I’m happy with most of their products but this thing isn’t ready for the real market, yet. Save your money and buy something else",1
1925,"I really enjoyed the halo band for the sleep tracking, which seemed accurate. The activity point system could use a tune up, the ""tone of voice"" feature kills the battery super quickly, and the body scan was difficult to use. After using this device for a little more than half a year, the cover protecting the sensors on the underside came off. As in, I took off the band and the protective cover was stuck to my arm. I never got the device wet, so I can only imagine that would speed up this process. I was able to return for a refund, but what's the point of getting this device if it doesn't even last a year?",2
1926,Make sure your halo is plugged into a good powerful USB charger when you pair it. I had a lot of issues that really annoyed me when I first tried it because it did not work. I will post a new review after I’ve use this thing for a little while,3
1927,"I purchased this product in January this year. It was not the best looking fitness tracker; but I really enjoyed all the features that kept me motivated to be active. But, 7 months later, give or take a few days, the little rubber band that goes around the tracker and seals it came off and it stopped working. I have not used it in any other ways than the intended, according to the instruction manual that came with it. My activities are HIIT at home and jogging; nothing extreme that could have provoked this issue.I am very disappointed with the device’s durability. I’ve worn fitness trackers from other brands before and they always worked perfectly for over 3 years.",2
1928,"I've been using this since November. My least favorite part is it doesn't seem to sync with any other apps for a holistic view of health.As for the device, its fine. Definitely more comfortable than the plastic straps of others but its beginning to fray from the velcro.The app, not worth paying for. Doesn't read activities properly, if the activity is changed, you can lose points. Sleep tracker was probably the best thing about it but don't need to pay money to know if I slept. Too many clicks to find specific data. I experienced an app issue where the device wasn't syncing or capturing data correctly so somewhere along the line there was an update that didn't make its way to me.",2
1929,"It's ok. The body scan feature is cool but I dont care for the point system that it uses to track your activity. Also, I know that the ""no screen"" is the point but I wish it at least have a watch. If I'm wearing something on my wrist all day I'd rather not have to have a watch too.",3
1930,Useful and easy to use.,5
1931,"I purchased this device mainly for sleep and fitness tracking. I have an Apple Watch as well but the details Halo provides for are superior and go beyond tracking by providing recommendations, from experts, on how to improve.The sedentary tracking helps provide greater motivation not just to stand once an hour but to encourage continual activity. In addition the articles and exercising labs provided are relevant, interesting and encourage overall lifestyle choice improvements. I’m excited to continue learning, using features, and running more labs.The band is comfortable, but the charging mechanism could be improved.The app is easy to use as well.",5
1932,The halo fits very well!! Everything works incredibly well. Very comfortable also. I just don’t like how hard it is to charge up. It doesn’t fit easily into the chargeable base. It takes you a while to get it in there properly.,4
1933,i left my Haloband without charging for some time and now it doesn't work it doesn't charge at all i thought it was the charger but i tested it on another halo and the problem is really with the device,1
1934,"I purchased this in the invite/beta phase (Sept. 2020).  At that time, I could not get it to track sleep during the day (i work swing shift 4/4 night/day) when I worked nights.  App states it doesn't track day time sleep.  Very disappointed!  During the time I was using it, I thought they might ask for feedback to improve it's operation and tracking....they did not. It doesn't seem to track anything it is supposed to accurately...if at all.I've owned a few Fitbits (currently using Charge 4).  I DO NOT recommend buying (or  paying $3.99/month).I also tried cancelling the $3.99/month before I start getting charged, and 4 service reps couldn't figure out what I was talking about.  The only thing I can do is deregister the device.  This device is not worth the headache.",2
1935,"This broke after six months. It worked well for health and sleeping, I really liked the voice and heartrate monitor. Amazon reached out and replaced it within a couple of days. So far so good.",4
1936,"I ordered this as a Christmas present. If you want moderate monitoring and personality profile, go for it. But its missing most health monitoring and needs to be charged frequently. After less than a week, ive ordered a newer version of my older model health watch.  Its all in what you want, great new features. But not enough of the health specific ones im used to.",3
1937,Not what I thought it was going to be. It tracks sleep well. But the voice recognition is pointless. It only records random times throughout the day.The band is super uncomfortable and it’s bulky. Thumbs down.,3
1938,Love this little thing. I still wear my watch most days but will not use the watch alone ever again. The sleep tracking is great. The overall view of the week has done so much for my activities. The body scan feature- while the results are not the numbers I want - they are very helpful and accurate. I have not tried the voice feature as my tone is not the priority at this time. I am also loving that is only have to charge the halo once or twice a week for about 30-40 minutes.,5
1939,"I love this for tracking my sleep. I would love it even better if it could track my heart rate, blood pressure,  and my body temperature. What it does track it does really well along with the app.",4
1940,"Product was going well.  I wore it all the time and barely noticed it.  I went to sync it with my app, and it asked me to double click (which it does occasionally).  I went to do so- the band was still on my wrist by the electronic component fell out.  So.  That’s fun.",3
1941,"I've never been a watch or band wearer.  So it took a little getting used to wearing this band but it didn't bother me as much as other bands i've tried in the past.  Now I only take it off to shower and that's it.  Sleep tracker can help you see why you may be waking up not feeling rested and I like how it uses the point system for activity rather than just purely tracking steps.  Friend at work got one too, which we have friendly competitions daily that we call ""Halo Wars"".",5
1942,"The sleep tracking is ridiculous. I have sleep apnea and my CPAP machine tracks my sleep, which is nowhere near the Halo’s tracking (when it decides to track it). The app itself is great and the score makes it fun to be more active. The body scan is very motivating as well. All in all, if you’ve already got an Apple Watch, I wouldn’t recommend the Halo.",3
1943,"If I could give this zero stars, I would - mostly for the lack of support. My halo battery went dead and the band will not charge. After searching for help in the app and on the website I gave up and called a customer service number.I was transferred several times and the person I ended-up with didn't understand the issue. She kept focusing on the charging clip and I kept telling her the clip works, the band's light will come on but even after 24 hours, when you unclip the band, it's dead.  I explained that I purchased an additional clip and THAT didn't work either. After what seemed like forever she said she would send me a replacement with a mailing label to return the old one.Cool... or not when a few days later I receive another charging clip - and with no return label.I decided to play along and try the new clip. NOPE. Doesn't work. Guess what? IT IS THE BAND! But try to find somebody to explain that to.Here I am, a band that doesn't work and 3 charging clips, one of which I'm sure Amazon will bill me for because they didn't give me a return label to send the darn thing back.",1
1944,"I don’t love this... First off, I wore it on the same wrist as my Apple Watch for a couple of hours and it rubbed the dark grey finish off of my brand new Apple Watch. I don’t think the sleep tracker is accurate. There have been times I was laying in bed watching a movie and it tracked that I was asleep - and in a deep sleep at that.  I’m also not positive the step tracker is accurate as it gives VERY different readings than my Apple Watch. It is not comfortable. The shape of the device pushes into my wrist and starts to hurt after a while. It is kind of a nightmare to get charged... it takes me a solid 5 minutes to get the device to register that it’s on the charger. That gets really annoying.",2
1945,"I waited 4 months to give an accurate review and I LOVE this band and app. You don’t even notice it’s there which is nice. The app has a ton of features and awesome suggestions. The body fat calculator has been very useful and I have sense lost weight. I also use this band in conjunction with weight watchers and it enhances my experience. It’s worth the price. I haven’t had any discomfort with the band and it’s light weight. This band is great for having a holistic way to checkin with your fitness goals, highly recommend.",5
1946,"The biggest annoyance is the charging process. It is difficult to open the clip device without it slipping out of your hand. Then, the contacts for the charger are super temperamental and you have to align the charger to the Halo EXACTLY right or it won’t charge. When it’s charged and synced to the app it’s fine.",3
1947,"Battery lasted 2 months before it stopped taking a charge. Left in charger for 24 hours the battery remained at 8%. Worked through all troubleshooting (different outlets/USB ports, cleaning the connectors, ensuring it was seated properly both with and without the strap).Return Policy - Amazon accepted the return, but with a restocking fee. How are they expecting to restock a faulty product? It's their product and multiple people are having this issue after a couple of months usage.All of that said, I'm really disappointed as the tracking was decent and the app was well created. I saw a lot of complaints about the fat tracking and point system. Personally I liked these, it was a great way to benchmark and see if improvements were being made. It encouraged me to move more throughout the day. If the battery issues are addressed I'll most likely get a replacement in the future.The return policy though dropped all stars. Products of this nature should have at least 1-2 years life in them. No customer should have only a partial refund when the product is defective after 2 months.",1
1948,"I am a previous user of Apple Watch, for reference.I got this watch primarily toA. Track my StepB. Track my SleepThe step tracking works just the same as any other watch, but nonetheless I was pleased. Sleep tracking works, but it's not entirely accurate for those of us who toss and turn in our sleep. I noticed I could lay down for an hour trying to sleep, but it only tracked my time to fall asleep as under 10 minutes. I like that the watch doesn't have a screen, but I don't use most of the functions. It's an interesting idea, however I believe it needs to be fleshed out some more.The battery life on this thing is incredible. With Speech turned off, it will last a full week on one charge.UPDATE: I’ve had this for less than six months, and it has stopped syncing to the app. I now no longer have any functionality, as I cannot access any of the data. I’ve tried every fix. This will be going in a dark space in my closet. Don’t buy this.",1
1949,Personally I like it and find info interesting and informative. I focus on steps and sleep but the voice monitoring is entertaining. For the price it is worth it. I have Apple Watch and fit bit but I have worn this and like it.,4
1950,"I had hoped this would be a good supplement to my Apple Watch - especially for the better sleep tracking. I've used this for about 5 days, and in that time I got ONE full night tracking. The rest were either partial or nothing at all due to ""possibly sleeping on the device.""  Hmmmmm. Decided to return - I'll stick with my Apple Watch.",3
1951,"Wanted a fitness tracker without a screen; this was the only option I found.  I liked the fit, loved the data, loved the app.  Bought in June 2021, the back of the tracker fell off in September.  Amazon said they would replace it but when the replacement never arrived, they said they actually meant that they wouldn't replace it.  I had already paid for a one year Halo membership so I purchased a new one from Target - this one lasted from September to February and the back of the tracker fell off.  I don't EVER wear it in the shower or to wash dishes or to wash my face.  It's just incredibly poorly made and Amazon won't stand behind it.After above review... Amazon called me back to see how they could ""make this right"" but the number that they gave me to call went nowhere and the link that they sent me to ""resolve things immediately"" just took me back here to my original review.  Huh.",1
1952,"UPDATE: Hello, I received reset instructions from customer service to “resolve” the battery issue I’ve been experiencing since I set up the Halo 2 days ago. I followed the instructions & charged the band before leaving for a 45 minute walk. I synced when I returned. The battery was at 55%. I tried to sync again 4 hours later, and discovered that the battery had run out completely. I had to charge the band before I could sync. I haven’t set up voice recognition, yet. With battery performance like this, I would have to charge every hour if I wanted to use that feature. Also, the band is useless for sleep because I sleep longer than 4 hours per night. At this point, I can’t recommend the band to others. I’m also convinced that I’m better off sticking with my Garmin watch.The battery is the worst! Last night I charged it before bed & it was dead this morning. It didn’t record any sleep (I only slept about 7.5 hours). I charged it fully before walking the dogs for 45 minutes this morning. I synced when I returned home & the battery was at 35%. I think I’ll stick to using my Garmin watch to track sleep & activity, and my scale for body composition.",1
1953,Overall a good product when you are able to wear it. But unfortunately due to extremely poor charger design it hasn’t been at a full charge since the day I bought it. It will appear to start charging then I will come back to it an hour later and the battery percentage hasn’t moved. I expected WAY more from a multi million dollar company.,3
1954,The battery life and charging time are horrible. With a small window for voice recognition scheduled the battery is typically only good for a day. Charging time can take up to an hour. The features offered are useful though... at least while free.,3
1955,I works as expected.,5
1956,I have worn various Fitbits over the years. It product is unfortunate not the new change I had hope it would be. The band it comes with feels horrible and cheap with scratchy fabric and a Velcro closure. Not conducive to sleeping in it and I miss that my fit bit displayed the time and my steps at minimum. This doesn't even charge easily. Disappointing product.,3
1957,"I have worn my Halo daily since June. I take it off before showering and never submerge it in water. I love the tracking and the app. However, my only issue is today when removing it before showering the plate that cover the sensors on my wrist came off. It has since come off twice today. I’m worried I will lose this and then not be able to use it anymore.",5
1958,"I like the product idea - no display, minimally invasive.The battery does not last enough (after ~6 months of use, ~36 hours).The features should be part of the prime subscription - not worth it to pay $4 / month.",3
1959,"I was so looking forward to the Halo. Unfortunately, it's been underwhelming so far. The simplicity and lack of tones and alerts is appreciated. However, it looks a bit cheap and low-end. I was really looking forward to the tone feature. After a couple days, though, I turned it off, because it quickly drains the battery and did not provide much useful feedback. Activity tracking is either overly generous with awarding points or has a super low bar. The body scan is cool, though it's been on par with scales I've used. If wearing during sleep, there's a green light that sometimes comes on from the underside of the device. Despite all this, I would have kept wearing Halo through the six month free membership, but I kept getting a weird feeling/pain in my wrist area. I wish I could send it back.",2
1960,Well the first few days it was great . The only thing that was a problem is that the battery didn't last bit 2 and a half days. Then after about 2 weeks it started acting up it stop counting my steps and upday when I checked it. Then it would update but say that it hadn't link up and updated for 3 days. So it stop keep up with everything. Not a good purchase I wish I had kept the box and the rest of the things that it come with so I could have returned it. But this was the first product I purchased that didn't work properly.,2
1961,"4 months in and...well...nothing really.  Best feature is the Body scanner-hands down.  Ill probably keep it just for that feature.  Everything else is either late to the game, or beta testing another device that Amazon will probably 'brick"" in another year.  A lot of complaints are due to folks not reading the description, or doing the research.  ""No display""?  DUH!  IMO, if you're looking to destress your life, overcome  Anxiety/Depression issues than this device can potentially help you.  If you're looking for a tracker to accentuate your training, and add metrics to your plan, this IS NOT the device you want-Id suggest an Oura ring paired with a Garmin, Sunnuto, etc.  Just my two cents, your mileage might vary.  Oh, the the Voice analyzer is useless",2
1962,I never had a want for the Apple watch because I didn’t want to be so connected. However when I found this I was happy it did not have a screen. Sleep is something I struggle with and I was blown away to have all the details on my sleep and have a way to track it. Tracking steps more accurately is a plus too. I love all the other features as well and hope to use them more in the future,5
1963,"Purchased the Halo during early access and had quite a few issues with it. The app, no matter what background or lighting, would not register my photos for body scans. I tried numerous outfits, and scenarios and it never worked.The cloth band is unbelievably itchy, so I bought the sports band that too is an issue as it does not fit perfectly, either it's too tight or too loose.The heart rate monitor is nice, the sleeping apps are fairly nice as well. I like knowing what my sleep score is, however it seems that the sleep time is slightly off.All in all, this is a decent band for things, it needs more features, but for $99 it's not bad. They need to fix the app though when it comes to body scans.",2
1964,"I'm a CrossFit athlete, and I was hoping this would be a nice alternative to the WHOOP. But, unfortunately, it does not give me enough in-depth data for improving my.oerformance over time.For someone just starting on their wellness journey, this would be great for you! Especially if you prefer to stay ""less connected"" than with and apple watch or other ""smart watch"".",3
1965,Love the product! Sleep and activity tracking are awesome. Tone/voice analysis really cuts down on battery life and my charger stopped working after about two weeks.,4
1966,"I bought this thinking it would be on par with Fitbit and other trackers. Unfortunately, it's not. Not only is it inaccurate as all heck - I got a defective one. The electronic part of the band fell off at some point - I wasn't aware of when or even how - and is gone. I never tried to separate them, never bumped it or did anything to promote the separation of the two, and yet... I tried to get ""product support"" since I was almost 2 weeks from the refund date. I was told I could buy a new one and be refunded in 5 - 7 days. I chose to just suck it up and eat the loss. I don't want the piece of junk, I just regret thinking it would be worth the money I spent on it.The sleep tracking - complete fail.The mobile app - the only decent part of the whole package.The activity tracking - almost complete fail (some days work better than others)Positives: The app has helpful tools. The full body photo tracking is pretty cool  It's waterproof.",1
1967,I purchased this a year and half ago and have had to factory reset this five times since owning.  I should not have to do this all the time.  When it worked I really enjoyed it but not checking this all time loosing a whole day's worth of details is not ideal.  The apps available are actually pretty good enjoyed it while it worked but just know this is not a long term purchase and for the amount of money I would expect better.,2
1968,"Looks great and works great it's just that soon after I purchased this the Amazon decided to add ""buy one and you'll get one accessory band for free"".... nice",4
1969,"I had an undiagnosed medical condition (hyperthyroidism) causing tachycardia and the halo did not generate any data that could have alerted me to the issue.I then returned it and got a Garmin Vivoactive watch and within a day realized my heart rate was dangerously high from the excellent data  Garmin produces. I'm shocked the halo could put your health a risk because it's features don't actually help you monitor anything about your health.also useless - the tone feature: I got the halo to help me understand my tone of voice better (I'm autistic) but the tone analysis it gives you is not generated in real time and so it's unclear what you said when that generated a negative tone result (such as ""irritable at 12:05 am"") therefore this feature is useless for biofeedback and learning.finally, sleep tracking is not useful because the battery runs out so quickly that i'd constantly find it was already dead on my arm unless i charged it every night. so you can't sleep track at night. Plus the charger is a big clip that goes around the whole watch.  it can be backwards and not charge but hard to tell its not in correctly. poor design that's not user friendly.",1
1970,"Pros:Sleep tracking: 4 starsMobile App: 4 starsVoice Recognition : 4 starsThe app is well designed with information that replaces at least 2 other tracking apps.The way it’s presented is in a gamified way that really speaks to me, so I like that as well.Cons:It’s a bulky, rocky thing that bruises my wrist. I’ve switched wrists in the unlikely event it helps, otherwise I will be returning for this reason only.Other cons that are “opportunities for improvement”:- is not interopable with iPhone health app- cannot add naps- does nothing hook onto my fitness or other food tracking app for a more complete picture- some clunkiness with the app where it’s hard to fing programs you’ve subscribed to, but can find them eventually.",2
1971,"Wasn't a fan of the BMI feature where you have to take several images of your naked body.  I understand the purpose and that these are supposedly never transmitted to Amazon's servers, however, I've also seen enough headlines where companies abuse user data to really be certain that they aren't going anywhere.  Voice feature is cool and helped me analyze my voice patterns as others detected it, actually improved my professional communication since I became more aware of inflections and subtleties that I otherwise would never have realized.That being said, MY UNIT DIED 10 MONTHS after I purchased.  According to the Amazon portal I'm S.O.L. since the ""support period"" ends after 6 months.  I'm convinced it's related to faulty battery management since the LEDs light up and unit seems normal as long as it's physically connected to the charger, but once I disconnect the band everything goes instantly dead.Overall, find something better in the market.  You as a consumer have plenty of choices given the explosion of fitness wearable devices that seems to have occurred over the past year",1
1972,"Good but not for me, having something on my wrist but NOT being able to use it to tell time doesn't work for this Gen Xer",4
1973,"Haven’t been able to get it connected.  Going on my 3rd one.  Hoping the next one will work.  Disappointed that it doesn’t connect as easily as my Fitbit.  Update: 3rd one connected easily, so if you get one that doesn’t - call them and get a replacement.  I’ll update once I have had a chance to use it.",3
1974,"I like the sleep tra king, but I am not sure I agree with it every time. The atep measurement see.s more accurate than  others I have had. I also like the heart rate monitor.",4
1975,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my wife. I was pretty excited about the possibilities of what this could do, but it did not live up to its promises.1- battery life is horrible. If I wanted to charge my tracker daily, I would have bought an Apple Watch2- worst charger design ever. Super tricky to get everything to align correctly so that it will charge3- voice recognition only gives a couple of samples throughout the day. Not even close enough to be beneficial.4- band looks old and worn out after just a month5- charging is slow.I can’t think of anything positive to say about this.",2
1976,"Great and easy to use. I thought the fact that it doesn’t have a screen would bother me, but it’s actually a plus. I love, love the way activity is measured. I was so used to just hitting a specific number over a few hours that I wasn’t really paying attention to hours I would spend sedentary. I like the body scan, I just wish it were a little more like my actual body and not just general representation. Love the tone feature especially since I am a very verbal person and I’m not always aware of my tone when speaking to others.",5
1977,"Really liked this until last week. I have had the Halo since early December 2020. Worn it daily and charged it when low which was about once every 5-6 days.  This past week the battery drains in less than 24 hours and I don't even have tone on!! What the heck is happening.  I can't charge this daily, it doesn't even have a screen! What is using up the battery?  Is tone on and I see it as off? Cause that would explain it and... that would be really,  really interesting.",5
1978,"I am very disappointed with the Amazon Halo. I feel the product had great potential but fell flat and was not what I expected from Amazon!. I have several issues with the device.1) The device itself is bulky and uncomfortable to wear at times.2) The Tone of Voice analysis is completely inaccurate and a joke. I tried several times to reset up the voice analysis and have not had any accurate analysis from the device.3) I am unimpressed with the Body Compossion feature. You should be able to see side by side views of current and previous scans,4) The device only tracks sleep overnight.5) The Charging device is a joke and sometimes the connector does not line up properly to the clip.If I could still return the device, I would.",2
1979,Sleep info is much more in depth than Apple Watch!,5
1980,"It was good,but I like my Fitbit Versa 2 better. I did miss the watch and instant access to exercise data, temperature and reminders to move. The only thing that was good was the BMI measurement. The tone of voice predictor of moods had me almost always depressed. I am quiet, thoughtful person with a quiet voice. I don't think yelling makes you happy.",3
1981,I have lost 24 pounds and halo was an integral part of my journey.,5
1982,It is pretty accurate I believe. I love that it tracks how many steps you take. After the first of the year I intend to get more steps in. And it is real accurate about the quality of your sleep. It also tells you how much body fat you have. You take a picture of yourself and this is called a body scan. This will help you if you are overweight or obese. The Halo also has labs. There are a lot on this Halo that will help you. I recommend it! You can buy different bands in different colors too.,5
1983,"Most inconsistent piece of tech ive ever had. Heart rate monitor that gives lower than resting hr at full out sprint. The fit is bad, the readings are bad the app has potential and some good features but doesnt account for how terrible the monitor is",1
1984,Only fault was the charger,5
1985,I was looking for a replacement for my Fitbit and came across the Halo.  Reading the description I thought this might be a good replacement.  I under delivered my expectations.  The app is more focused on pushing insights and classes then giving clear easy to access data. You need to click multiple times to get simple data like heart rate.  The body mass requires you to use your phones camera to scan your body. I found this time consuming and not helpful.  The tone feature can be interesting but found it would have data points when I know I was not in a conversation.  It also does no get context so I often found it not helpful.  Net skip this product an keep to more traditional fitness trackers.,2
1986,"Does everything I want it to do.  So light and small, I don't even notice I'm wearing it.  Sleep tracking and activity/steps seem very accurate for me.  I love the body scan and estimated body changes is very motivational.What I don't like is the voice tone feature.  When I had it turned on, would only give me 3 or 4 insights a day and drained the battery incredibly fast.  I couldn't through an entire day without charging the device.  Now that it's off, I get 5-6 days between charges.",5
1987,"Ok I know this is new and can always use feedback. My biggest feedback is the band gets dirty easily and there is no display screen. I love the unique features it offers such as body composition...that knocks the competition out of the park but as far as the actual band goes, it could use some improvements",3
1988,,5
1989,Like the sleep tracker but its hard for you see exact timing of how long u wake up for in the middle of the night or other factors.While working out you can see spikes in your heart rate IF U STARE AT your phone you cant track to see when and during what exercise I peaked.,3
1990,"Came as advertised, app is insightful and user friendly.Only “issue” is having to wear it incorrectly as it wont read heart rate/sleep functions through tattooed skin!",4
1991,"It’s a great tool, I have been loving it...until it started irritating my skin. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the size guide isn’t accurate, it recommended a medium, but I ended up having to buy an additional small band, just fyi.",4
1992,"I love the simplicity of the band itself, it's great for someone who just wants a general idea of activity and access to different video ""labs."" However, I made the mistake of getting the rose-colored band. It's barely been a month and the thing looks like I've worn it for years. Plus, I can't get a replacement any time soon, so that sucks.",3
1993,"I bought this for the Tone feature but I am disappointed. It constantly picks up TV, Radio, and others on Zoom type meetings. I like the app but the tone section is selective about what it will show you. For instance it will say you are 10% with the pink/ frown line but will not always tell you about it. Instead it will say you had 5.4 seconds when you sounded excited. I would like to be able to click the line I'm interested in and see what it was that caused Halo to decide I was excited or irritated. I think that section of the app could be developed. The sleep section of the app is spot on. I wore my Fitbit and Halo together for a week and they reported exactly the same.",2
1994,"Did not as good as I expected. I have used cheaper and better fitness wrist than this. It’s cool idea for the appearance, but trust me a interactive Unser interface on the fitness watch can be so much more helpful, without pulling out your phone once a while. Fitness tracking is average, I do expect more.",3
1995,I've had a fitbit charge 3 for months now and was better than I thought it was. Saw that amazon was coming up with their own version and sounded good so I gave it a try Wich I was disappointed. You have to charge it every other day the sleep pattern is less detailed the cloth strap keeps moving around so the heart rate monitor can't check your heart rate also it smells bad after a while. I was thinking of getting a silicon strap but saw it was 30$ while the fitbit straps are 6$ . Also I'm used to checking the time on the fitbit and the halo is just annoying at this point so I'm just going to return it and hope they come up with a better version since Amazon's is a bigger company than fitbit,2
1996,A lot to like. Appears accurateWish it connected with more third party apps like WWWould like to see what new programs they add - not sure I will continue subscription after free trail without more programs being added and continuously to keep internet up,3
1997,It doesn’t seem accurate. The heart rate has been off quite a bit in comparison with my HRM. The sleep tracker is okay bit it’s a little aggravating to be reminded when you had a bad nights sleep. It does offer some motivation to stay active with its unique light moderate and intense categories.,3
1998,"I really did give the halo a chance I wanted this product for sometime because of the reading your tone, it was great but I don’t know if I got a lemon but after a few days it messes up to where I get a orange light meaning there is a error. I thought well something went wrong so I went and reset it and redid everything, it started working again after a few days again same issue happened, I was enjoying the halo so much it’s a great fitness band but I’ve been going though so much trouble I’m gonna send back and try another one if this one does the same I’m gonna have to refund this completely",2
1999,I purchased this to work with my Weight Watchers app to see how I'm doing with excerise along with my diet.  I haven't figured out how to use the Halo to get results from it.  The sleep part of it works great.  Haven't learned the Body part of it and not interested in the tone of my voice.,3
2000,Sorry Amazon. Stick to products stick to Alexa and leave the wearable technology to the pros. I tried everything imaginable I was so excited because it connects to weight watchers and wound up never connecting to anything very frustrating. I really wanted this to be my go to but I guess I have to stick with my Fitbit,3
2001,"I been trying everything out on this band and I love it. Sleep tracking and the mobile app are nice. I have been uses my fitbit ant Halo side by side I only see some slight variation, but not enough for me not to love it. Warning ⚠️ If you don't won't to see your body this might not be for you, but if you're on a fitness journey like I'm on you won't mind seeing your body. Research this fitness band first💖👍",5
2002,"I liked the watch and the app for a while, it was a different way of point scoring and keeping active. I purchased early access so I received it in September.I had some life changes, moves etc, and I stopped using it for about 2 months. Just went to get back on track and start using again, and it won't hold a charge?? I contacted Amazon for support and they do not have any and cant even get it replaced. They are making a one time exception to return, it minus a restocking fee. How are they going to restock this?It's a piece of junk. They had potential and just didn't follow through on it. If it goes on sale again I wouldn't recommend.",2
2003,"I wish it gave me resting heart rate average during sleep time only.HR monitoring is OK, my Polar chest strap is more accurate.I get 150 points in two days only seems too easy of a weekly goal.",4
2004,"I was accepted into their early access program and I was so excited to try this product. It’s been 2 months since I’ve purchased it and I can tell you I wear it every single day. I get a lot of questions about my halo from friends or relatives. It’s a cool minimalistic device. I feel like there’s someone always there, which is great because I dislike being alone. Halo’s sleep feedback is great, I recently became a mother and halo confirmed that I sleep 3-4 hours a night. I’d recommend it! There is nothing on the market like it.",5
2005,I love my Halo. I like to wear an old school watch so didn't want the tracker with a screen so this is perfect.  I wish it was smaller but it takes a while to get comfortable because of where you wear it but after a few weeks I hardly notice it. The sleep tracker is great and insightful.,5
2006,I honk it’s okay so far but the pink band looked gross & dirt by the second day. I’m a very clean person with a desk job so I didn’t put it through anything crazy. Wish I would’ve bought the gray one.,3
2007,"3-hour bike ride with multiple uphill pushes....definitely would be a pretty intense workout.....halo classifies it as ""35 minutes of moderate activity"". This has happened with multiple different kinds of workouts - 30 minutes of intense workout on the rowing machine gets classified as 8 minutes of ""moderate"" activity. If I manually enter either of these activities, it qualifies them with much more accurate ratings so it's clearly a disconnect in what the device is actually capturing.For context, I'm generally pretty in shape with a very healthy heart. I wish there was a better way to calibrate the activity levels to better align with what is actually happening.Sleep tracking seems to be relatively accurate, and charging is thankfully pretty quick though.",2
2008,Sleep tracking is pretty accurate and effective.,5
2009,"Short and simply put, it does what it says. It seems to be quite accurate, though I'm not a doctor. The tracking seems more advanced than most fitness bands.As for comfort - When worn in the correct position (a bit high on wrist, past the wrist bone and singed snugly), I hardly notice it's there. Yes the unit is a bit large, but it fits very nicely with the curves of your wrist once you get it in the right position.Overall, if the claims they make are something you're after, I highly recommend this fitness band",5
2010,The app allows you to measure alot more than other fitness trackers which alone is pretty useful. The calibration can be off at times but does try and correct itself throughout the day. The sleep tracking is quite accurate.,4
2011,"Was excited to use this but was disappointed. It has lots of features but you need to take your phone out to view them. My Fitbit Versa shows me steps, calories, and sleep without having to take my phone out. If it came out in a smart watch I would be more apt to use it.",3
2012,I didn’t mean to give it a bad rating until I received a reminder to renewal the halo membership of 3.99 a month. I didn’t even hesitate for a moment to cancel it. The Halo band is such a waste of money! I used it to check my sleep quality. And that’s all. I won’t recommend buying it at all. Apple Watch is also doing the job plus it tell you what time it is. Halo is doing basic and nothing fancy. It’s overpriced! And the tone analysis is useless. The body weight analysis is even a bigger joke! Not sure how they handle those half naked pictures! Feels not safe at all.,2
2013,"Unfortunately this product misses the mark, but a lot. It's uncomfortable, clunky, and inaccurate. I also didn't like how my rose colored band got dirty after just a couple of days. I never did anything strenuous either, just wore it around the house or out while driving or walking so to me it's unacceptable the band gets gross looking after such a short amount of time.The only good thing I have to say about this product is the app. It's actually pretty nice, visually and feature wise. It's very informative, but you have to pay a monthly fee to use all of the features after a 6 month free trial. That's a pretty big turn off to me, I don't want to pay what I've already bought once, ya know?I returned the product.",2
2014,I love everything about this app! It helped improve my sleep.,5
2015,This product is amazing. If you enjoy low profile wrist bands and state of the art technology then this lifestyle tracker is for you. The body scan is a great feature and a nice motivator for me to continue with my fitness goals. This is not for anyone who needs constant reassurance throughout the day or has low self esteem because Halo keeps it real. If you prefer honest assessments and tools to improve your quality of life then look no further.,5
2016,"Love that it tracks the quality of my sleep letting me know when I fell asleep, how long I slept, the different stages of my sleep, and how many disturbances I had during the night. Then it rates my sleep and gives me my final score.It t also tells me my tone of voice throughout the day letting me know how I come across to people.And of course it tracks your activity level and does a complete scan of your body analysis. It’s almost like there’s someone living inside your body.",5
2017,Great item.,5
2018,So lite weight that I forget I’m wearing it and I love it.,4
2019,"Initially I really didn't like the halo.  the features seem incomplete considering what other watches provide, but i have found that is good for sleep tracking which I find useful and tracking overall movement throughout the week.  the tone feature sounded interesting but i didn't find it useful and it killed the battery quickly.  After turning off the tone feature the battery went from lasting 1 to 2 days to lasting 4 to 5 days as long as you only sync with the app a few times a day.  I bought this when it was $65.  For that price what it offers isn't too bad but I would definitely not pay the $99 that it is at now.  Pay a little more and get a product that does more",2
2020,I was excited when I seen this watch advertised. I received early access to purchase and couldn't wait for it to arrive. I’ve worn this for over a month now and I took it off today and put my Fitbit back on. Pros: sleep tracking is nice. It seems to be very accurate and I like that it can tell my body temperature changes. Cons: everything else...  I don’t want to type a novel so I’ll list the biggest con for me. If you want to utilize the majority of the features this watch has to offer vs other similar trackers be prepared to charge every single day.  I wouldn’t even mind if it would charge quicker. Like while I shower and brush my teeth. But it takes over an hour to charge each day.,2
2021,"Halo is charged and appropriately fastened to my wrist before I go to bed. I fall asleep around 9:30pm usually and wake up around 5:30am. Halo starts tracking sleep as late as 1:30am, but never begins tracking earlier than about 11:45pm. It says I have poor sleep - between 2 hours and 4 hours every night. I've had the Halo over a week now and there is no change.Proposed solution - we should be able to tell Halo via the app that we are in bed and starting to sleep. Halo should then start tracking how long it takes to fall asleep etc.",2
2022,"Charging clip is in perfect shape, yet it doesn't always charge and chooses to work when it wants. I refuse to buy another as I am very careful with my stuff and this accessory should work longer than the 6 months I've had these items.",3
2023,"I really liked the product, but unfortunately, it stopped syncing about a week ago, and it's a hassle to reset everything. I have to deregister and re-register the band every day for it to work, so it does not register all the data. It's too bad because aside from that, it worked fine and seemed pretty accurate.",3
2024,"I use it mostly for sleep tracking and to track my activity.  I like the record it keeps of my activity and inspires me to be more active.  I bought one for my daughter who is trying to get more active.  Not a big fan of the tone portion as I'm not convinced it is accurate.  The band is exceptional and cleans easily as I do a lot of gardening.  I am thinking of another band but I find the price tag a bit high.  Overall, I love the product.",5
2025,"My headine says it all. I am still not yet sold on this. I think the sleep trackiing is not very accurate, one time I got straight through 8 hours sleep and it tells me I did fair at 64% then I got 9 hours  with a bathroom break in there and it said I did good and gave me 80%. I have a broken leg right and using a knee cart but, I go all out on that knee cart and I get no points for exercise.It has been comfortable to wear for me. My biggest complaint is having to charge it almost everyday and the charger is a pain in the butt.I am thinking of returning it and looking for something else that is more user friendly all around.",2
2026,"I like my Halo, but the charger stopped working in August (I used my husband's after that) and the band stopped working today. 😢",3
2027,"Loved the halo, but very disappointed when it stopped charging after a month.  It’s a struggle to get it in place to charge as well.  Also when it stopped working amazon refused to replace it only refund it.  I had to wait for another invitation to buy.  I received one finally but at the new price.",3
2028,I loved this band until it started burning my wrist. I thought  it was too snug but wearing it loose didn't help. So now I wear it for sleep and exercises only.,3
2029,"I use the Halo to keep track of my heart rate as I have tachycardia.  I love the body scan part, too.  It takes your picture at different angles and then calculates your body fat.  You can adjust the image to your desired percentage of body fat and see what you will look like.",5
2030,,5
2031,"I was excited for the sleep tracking function of this device, not much else.Unfortunately I found it to be very inaccurate. Last night I was tossing and turning for quite some time before I fell asleep and I had this device on my wrist. When I woke up I expected to see a low sleep score and a long time before it indicated I fell asleep, however it showed 0 minutes to fall asleep!I think that this device does not accurately know when you entered the bed, and tries to make some assumptions from your movements/heart rate. I wish we could just tap the button twice or something to signal to it that ""I have entered the bed"" so that it can accurately track how long it took to actually fall asleep.",2
2032,Tracks physical activity well.  I don’t use the voice recognition.  I am not sure how accurate sleep tracking is.  Getting battery to charge is extremely difficult.  I would give battery charger a 1/5.,4
2033,A Must have,5
2034,"Device doesn't recognize all sleep, and you can't adjust it to reflect more. The app has way too much emphasis on food & recipes for my liking.  I'd prefer more granulated details on my movement and better sleep tracking.I did really like the faceless design, the fabric band and the Velcro closure.",2
2035,I like The sleep tracking feature. A lot more accurate than my Apple Watch. The only problem I’m having with this is I  have sensitive skin and I have A full rash all around the wrist I wear it on. I’ve never had this problem with any jewelry or my Apple Watch so if you are sensitive I wouldnt Purchase.,3
2036,"I found that Halo didn't track my sleep very well, sometimes thinking I was asleep when I was just chilling and watching Netflix!  Guess I need to move around more.  But I was comfortable!  And is there a better way of tracking BMI other than dancing around naked in the bathroom?",3
2037,I so wanted to love the Halo but I can’t deal with how my skin has reacted to it. It is so uncomfortable to wear. I have worn my Apple Watch and FitBit in the past and neither have irritated my skin or been uncomfortable like this has. If Amazon corrects this I may try it in the future.,3
2038,I was expecting a little more than what I got. The only thing that I actually like about this is the body imaging. The mic doesn't pick up well and according to the app I don't talk. The live heart rate is nice. But I'm disappointed for sure. I have better luck with my smart watch.,3
2039,"Halo took a big step backwards when it added junk, such as Try Related Programs and Daily Tips in the middle of the data.",4
2040,I like my band but it is giving me a skin irritation. I had to switch to my other wrist. It is also making my wrist smell funny.,2
2041,"For the price, this is a nice little tracking monitor. The app gives some great feedback as well as “labs” to help improve the areas that you need help with. The sleep tracker and voice tracker are super interesting. My sleep had improved because I was unaware how little sleep I was truly getting. I feel so much better since tracking with Halo. Also, the body scanner is a cool function that motivates you to stick to weight loss goals with realistic visualization. This isn’t a perfect gadget but for the price it’s  better than my Garmin!",5
2042,,5
2043,"I have been wearing for a month and it has done an ok job. Not great not horrible. Sometimes it does not catch a workout or activity if the charge is below 10 percent. Battery life if good. I really like the sleep tracker. Today after I worked out all of a sudden it started burning. I took it off drove home and by the time I arrive it had blistered. This is frustrating as I have not changed the way it is worn, no lotions, no changes in anything.",2
2044,"I've been using halo fitness tracker for several months and so far I really like it. I've used fit bit hr for several years, but the fit bit seems to lose accuracy after 2 years. I find that with halo it seems more accurate with my steps and calories burned. I like that it counts my steps when I am pushing buggy at the store, unlike my fitbit hr. I also like the body fat analyzer as well, that is the main reason I bought it. I will continue to use halo and hopefully continue to like it.",5
2045,The tradeoff for this activity tracker is that you give up a display for the tone recognition.  The problem with that is that the voice tone service drains the battery.  You'll be doing good to get a day and a half per charge versus the 6-7 days with it off.,3
2046,"When compared with my Fitbit and other trackers on the sleep metrics, it is about 10-15% off.The sleep score has even a wider disparity.Do not know how the activity score is achieved, but it needs a new algorithm.When the 90 free days are up, I will not be paying the monthly fee that kicks in.",3
2047,"The battery life isnt great barely lasts over a day, it isnt the most comfortable, and the charger is finicky.  It tracks things really well, but it subtracts points for any time over 8 hours you are not walking around making it hard not to lose points if you are have a desk job.",3
2048,"I’ve had fitness trackers for years and the Halo was announced when I was contemplating  a switch from FitBit to Apple Watch, perfect timing. In all I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.Activity - it’s more point based than steps. Makes it hard to measure how intense a workout was. Especially since there’s no screen on the band, to see heart rate you have to stop and pick up phone.Sleep - a lot of great info on stages in sleep cycles, time to fall asleep etc.Tone - interesting to know how others may perceive me but even when I know I am being a grouch it didn’t seem to pick it up.Body scan - the 3D model is fun but inaccurate compared to InBody scans. My body fat percentage was 14% off. Also it would be nice if the info was actionable.App integration - there are programs you can follow like working out and meditating but if you follow them they aren’t logged in the respective apps. There’s also no connection to food logging apps.Battery life - nonexistent, if you have the tone feature on you have to charge daily.",1
2049,"I love the potential of the features but the battery life (at least on my device) is terrible. It needs to be charged every 36 hours. Just not practical to wear if it is dead a good part of the time.Unable to navigate customer service chat to get help, most likely because of call volume.",3
2050,"The point-based system is a powerful motivator for me. I have greatly increased the amount of exercise I get since I started using Halo. It's also really helpful to see how many calories are burned each day so I can easily make sure I eat less than that to keep losing weight. An ""eat less and exercise"" diet is very easy to follow with Halo and the outcomes have been great for me. I don't need a fancy expensive watch since I already have a phone and the lack of display is no issue for how this product works.",5
2051,"I loved using this and the app. It has a great amount of detail for tracking. I didn't get to use the body analysis.I've been afraid to use it since it burned my skin, though. 😟",4
2052,"Been using it for a few days along with my Fitbit versa 2 for comparison. The step count in the Halo is off from the Fitbit by about 500 steps a day (I’ve been putting them on and taking them off at the same time each day). It’s only been registering about 3 hours of sleep per night compared to the Fitbit which comes in around 7 (which has got to be accurate because if I’m only getting 3 hours of sleep a night, nobody would want to be anywhere near me). I knew there was no notification of phone calls and text messages, but I do miss that. The fact that it doesn’t have a display panel doesn’t bother me.  I do like the overall look of it, and it’s very comfortable.",2
2053,"I love my Halo, only one complaint. It dies too quickly! Other than that it’s great! I have a newborn right now so it’s nice to see how much sleep I’m actually getting in (it’s not much lol).",4
2054,I like the sleep tracking however the activity tracker doesnt track correctly. Even if i am working out or running it still says its only moderate workout. I always hit over 300 hwart points for the week but i dont think it tracks activity intwnsity correctly.,3
2055,Unavailable to turn off voice recording kills battery life. The application does not track food and calories.,3
2056,"My first complaint is I have to charge it everyday. My husband has a competitor brand that lasts 5 days. Also, I can't get it to recognize my voice at all to set up the voice recognition aspect.  The fit and style are nice, just not fond of the short battery life.",3
2057,"After using for 2 weeks.Pros: comfortable band, no annoying screen, body scanner easy to use for one person  (unable to confirm accuracy), accurate step measurements.Cons: face of device against the skin is irritating, sleep tracker not accurate and poor graphic display on mobile app, no integration with apple health, monthly fee after trial ends",3
2058,I dislike the the battery life.  I feel like I have it on the charger more than my Fitbit or Apple Watch.I like the Halo features.Dislike the way it feels on my wrist.  Not sure if it is the band feel or not.,3
2059,"I really wanted fo like the Halo, but after using for a month or so, I am disillusioned. I was hoping for a more affordable Whoop but, no.  This thing is NOT accurate. I do Crossfit and as such know effort and heart rate. At times, it tells me that my heart rate in the middle of a very intense work out is like 110 -125, when I feel like my heart is beating out of my chest. And then I’ll run and it will show it at 170 when I am breathing evenly and in a rhythm.  It’s a bit frustrating. I would not bother with this version. Wait till they refine the design a couple iterations and then maybe it will be worth it.",2
2060,The sleep tracking is good but I don't feel it is consistent. I don't like that I will have to pay at some point.. i can't find where to opt out of the pay part,4
2061,"2021-01-01: Happy New Year to everyone! Welcome to 2021.This is a bug report. I have used Halo for about 2 weeks. Like its point tracking feature. However, when the clock turns to 2021, this week activity point on the homepage turns to zero, as showing on the first attached photo. The today point is still showing up, just the week point is zeroed. After entering the activity page, the week point shows up, but the today point on the upper right corner becomes zero. Looks like the data is still there, but not presented well.",5
2062,"Step counting is far from accurate if you work with your hands in any sort of way. I woke up one day to already have 150 steps on (I didn’t get up at all that night, that’s from me tossing and turning) and I work in a fairly stationary area and can still manage to take more “steps” then my boss who runs around the store all day long...Secondly I had to stop wearing it as I was having a reaction to the laser. After taking it off to charge after 2 days I noticed I had a bright red very sore to touch spot on my wrist where it was sitting. Kind of disappointing since I paid so much for it but I threw the box away so I can’t return it.",2
2063,"while the product itself is well made, the app is very lackluster and underwhelming. Navigation through the app is cumbersome, workout tracking is a pain, and heart rate monitoring in the app is useless if you want to use to during your workout. Ended up returning the product because it just wasn't useful enough to wear all day",3
2064,The idea that a display is distracting is a little goofy.  I like to be able to check what is going on with my body during various activities.  I admit it is small and less cumbersome than most fitness trackers but I don't really have much confidence in its accuracy.,3
2065,"I regularly do HIIT workouts where I reach a max HR of between 180-190, the halo never detects a HR above about 150. With no HRV tracking and inaccurate HR tracking during strenuous exercise this device is just not useful to me.Tone detection seems like it was a poor feature choice, it's very inconsistent, frequently detecting nothing at all, and doesn't provide actionable feedback, (what do I do with a note that says 4 hours and 28 minutes ago I sounded ""Hesitant"" for 2.1 seconds?) and yet this feature is why the device needs a microphone and physical button?Sleep tracking is decent, pretty accurate in my experience and the app is well designed. But this just isn't worth it, particularly when it comes with a monthly fee.",2
2066,"The band itself wasn't bad as it stayed put while on but the interface wasn't the greatest.  There isn't a display on the unit so you have to rely on the app and that is where the downfall was.  I subbed (and paid)  for the additional features.  When I went to look to see the data it didn't show up.  The app kept saying to check back.  Well I wasn't paying for a message, I was paying to learn the data.  Without that the unit was useless.  I honestly got better data from my Samsung phone and it's free health apps.",2
2067,"Overall the watch is pretty seamless, but there are a couple of features that kind of want me to just put this away until there is a new version.1. The battery life - the batter doesn't last more than 2 days, and I barely use the voice recognition feature, so that's a burden.2. Also, I wish there was a better battery indicator when battery was low. Too many times it just dies without any notice.3. I know that there was no display, but it would be nice if you can touch something, so you get some idea of your heart rate / battery life / summary of things4. Exercise start /end times - need a better way to indicate when you start and end exercise",2
2068,Absolutely love this!!!! Well worth the money ! Keep unbelievable data!!!,5
2069,"I was so excited to get this tracker but quickly became a bit disappointed. The app is full of ""labs"" but not really anything that shows what you are doing. I opened the app today for the first time in about 3 weeks, I've never figured out how to log my workouts or how to add food for tracking.",3
2070,"Loved the concept and design, but after 3 weeks, it stopped tracking sleep. Followed on-line support instructions for a few days with no luck.  Returned it to Amazon, surprisingly Amazon had no exchange option, just a return.  I would’ve tried another unit if offered.",3
2071,"I love my Halo band. The app is very user friendly and the metrics are easy to follow. The variety and amount of classes through the app are awesome, and the membership is very affordable. I like that this band does not have a screen, it’s one less thing I have to learn and look at throughout the day. I think this is a great workout band for the price and what it brings to the table.",5
2072,I loved the band till I didn't it worked great no issues with the app or the band did what I wanted and was low profile on my wrist but it stopped working and charging after only having it just shy of a month and I was still paying on it It really sucked😑,2
2073,I like the halo.  It has flaws in the BMI calculations - as they are inflated.  The sleep tracking is good and the mobile app is good.,4
2074,"I am trying the Halo bc I received one for free, with six months of the subscription for free.  It’s ok, but I definitely don’t love it.  I miss having a watch/visual feature.  It looks like I’m just wearing a weird bracelet, and I have to go to the app to see my progress for the day.  I often have to “pull down to sync” 3-4 times, for the unit to see on the app.  I also don’t like that I would eventually have to pay a monthly fee to get all of the features.",2
2075,"The Halo band is purely app based and you need a smartphone to check steps, calories burned etc.  Typically if I am working out and I have a calorie or other goal, I like to check to determine if I am on track.  Looking on my phone is not convenient especially if I am biking.  It is too bulky to wear a watch next to it unless you place it on your other wrist. and there is no basic time feature.  While I appreciate some of the features including sleeping tracking I feel that it would be a much more useful device if it had a basic user interface.",2
2076,I enjoy this product. App is great.,5
2077,"I bought this to try instead of buying the Whoop band. During workouts it doesn’t accurately measure my heart rate. Halo measures it significantly lower. I wore a myzone band and my Apple Watch which both seemed to catch my peak heart rate of 192, halo measured 150. Very disappointed as this is the main reason for purchasing. I don’t have anything to compare my sleep activity. My only complaint with the sleep tracker is that is thinks 6 hours is good sleep. And it only measures a disturbance if you are awake for 5 or more minutes. Won’t be buying again",2
2078,"Though this may be a great addition to my lifestyle, I prefer my FitBit. Why? Because I can easily view my activities on the device rather than needing to open the app on my phone.Also, the activities posted to WeightWatchers are considerably less than with the FitBit -- I wear both devices simultaneously.",3
2079,"Where to start?? I guess I'll start with the biggest annoyance. Activity tracking.. or lack thereof. This thing couldn't track the motions of a marathon if it's (product) life depended on it. Once in a great while, it will track my workouts as walks. Ok, really 45 minutes on the rower, another 45 doing weight training with my heart racing through all of it and nothing, or perhaps 15 minutes that triggers as a 'walk'. Pitiful. Don't get me started on manually adding activities! If you manually add an activity (they have many types: skiing, rowing, weight training, yoga, swimming, etc.)  they don't even use the heart rate that they've captured to create an effort-based score. Nope, they use a 'standard' list of points for the activity. 3 1/2 hrs of skiing, with 80% of it waiting in line or on a chair lift is 'intense' exercise. You'll get a whopping 420 points for that activity (they recommend you get 150 points a week to remain healthy) BTW, 1 1/2hrs in the gym with a high heart rate is 60-80 pointsSo yea, pass on this band. Garbage In Garbage Out - the data acquisition sucks, so the data you get in reports sucks.",1
2080,Getting it to sync is a continual problem.,2
2081,"Update: February 2022:I should have posted this sooner, but roughly 4 months ago, my halo stopped working again. It won't turn on, track my sleep, nothing. And I only wear it when I get into bed - it gets no exposure to water or anything else. I'm really disappointed.Update: June 2021:After posting my original review, I was contacted the same day by someone from Amazon offering to replace my Halo and I'm glad to report that the replacement consistently tracks and syncs, which was a huge relief. Given that I have 2 other fitness trackers, I use this as an additional source of data for my sleep patterns, so I can't speak to the activity tracking features.___________________________________________________The halo worked okay-ish for sleep tracking. Some mornings it wouldn't sync at all. Other mornings it would. It wasn't terribly accurate, so I would use my apple watch to help track my sleep as well. For approximately 4 days in a row now, it wouldn't sync at all, even after I double pressed the button on the band as instructed by the app. I even tried restarting it, but it was no use.",1
2082,"The accuracy for steps is very good. Accuracy for sleeping, needs Improvement. It does not track a short nap. The tone accuracy is way off! Overall I want to love this device, but it needs a lot of Improvement in more than one area. I am considering returning before my return date expires in another 30days.",3
2083,"I was going to rate this 4 stars... but honestly, it does everything it needs to do. I feel like the sleep tracking is fairly accurate. If I do a workout the points seem to register correctly according to my heart rate which also seem accurate. I don't have really anything bad to say. I have not tried out the tone feature as it does take up a lot of battery usage and I'm not too worried about it.",5
2084,I would like this a lot more if it was easier to sync. God help you if you turn your blue tooth off or if the battery dies. It takes FOREVER to resync. Currently going on 6 hours of trying  to get it to sync.,3
2085,"Device is wildly inaccurate, won't recognize sleep until I've been asleep for hours already. Reads my resting heart rate 20-30 bpm lower than it actually is. The tone of voice feature had some interest, but without any reference to what was said, the data it provides is useless. I know Amazon products can be rough at the start, but this falls so short of the mark that I think it's doomed to the scrapyard. I'm also developing a rash where the device sits against my arm.Amazon, If you're going to make customers pay to be alpha testers of your products, at least let us look at the data under the hood, so we can provide feedback to tune the system. Absolute waste of my time and money.",2
2086,I have used this and compared to the Fitbit I don’t think it’s worth it.  The Fitbit has a much better battery life and more dependable.  This needs charged after just two days.  Syncing issues too.  Maybe an update is needed.  If spending the money....go with a Fitbit. Much more dependable.,3
2087,"It's okay, I feel committed to it now that I have it. The BMI / Voice recognition sets it apart but it really feels inaccurate. I like the concept of activity points. I expect this to be a competitive fitness tracked in 5 years but not the first model.",3
2088,"The functionality of the Halo band is good enough I suppose. But I wanted to talk about a reaction I had to wearing the band for a couple of months.I noticed after about a month that it was getting itchy under the band. I didn't realize how bad it had become until recently. The skin is broken and is weeping slightly.I have never had a reaction to wearing anything else like other watches (I currently wear a Garmin without issues).I thought I would post this experience incase it was a concern to you.I have stopped wearing the band until the skin heals, not sure if I will continue using it after it recovers.",2
2089,"I have had this since November 2020 and it worked great until about three days ago it stopped synching with WW (the entire point of getting it).  It shows that is it connected and says its sending data but nothing goes into the APP.  Talked to WW, Amazon and even Samsung and no one knows why...they all say its the others person issue.  At any rate, this is now totally  useless to me as the two features I wanted the automatic syncing (which if WW would include an option to synch to my Samsung Active watch I wouldn't have gotten this to begin with) and the body scan, which is glitchy at best at any given time may never take the picture (you are too close, you are too far)!  At any rate, I think you are better off with a watch or fitbit and the RENPHO scale, which also calculates your body composition (just no picture).  I don't usually write reviews but this was a total disappointment and I was actually excited about the product and couldn't wait to get one.  Now its just money down the drain and back in the box it goes.",1
2090,"Great for monitoring sleep.Bad for monitoring sleeping during the day, naps. Nonexistent.TERRIBLE recharging, because it takes too long! And never charges fully. Contacts for charging are unstable.Therefore, we don't use it for VOICE (tone,) which uses battery life.EXCELLENT for videos to improve sleep and movement.",5
2091,"I really liked the idea of this device, tracking not just my activity, but also how much I spent sitting on my ample backside, but it did not perform as it should.  Quite often it failed to track my sleep, which may have been due to my tossing and turning during the night, but I felt it should have given some indication.  The LED showing when it was charging stopped working and recently it failed to maintain a charge.  If they get these issues fixed and get it accepted to other third party apps, I may return to using it.",2
2092,"So the band it’s pretty, comfortable to wear and relatively easy to use. The app is ok but not great x I purchase this band November 9,2020 and  it started giving me issues about 3 month ago. It deletes my activities, does not keep track of steps taken during the day (I also use pacer to check the accuracy of my band) when I try to manually add an activity the screen goes black. So the band its great while it works but sadly the lifetime of this product is not good. 10 months is not enough I think.",2
2093,"The Halo is an interesting first try for Amazon into the fitness wearables market.  It's reasonably comfortable and ok as a fitness tracker.  However the lack of a display to at least show the current time, kills much of its utility for me as I've grown to rely on my fitbit as a watch.  Seems like a small thing.  But the display on the fitbit makes the device considerably more useful.  I've since stopped using the Halo as I really don't want to wear what amounts to a cloth bracelet purely for functionality which the Fitbit already provides.",2
2094,"Not too bad, but I am not sure how accurate the body fat calculator is nor do I feel that the tone analyzer is accurate either, other than that I think the Halo is similar to a fit bit. I do like that it is smaller than the apple watch which can be clunky on my wrist.",3
2095,"I really loved how powerful the potential of this device is. Unfortunately, I cannot wear it. It is not made of hypoallergenic metals. All good quality jewelry today is, so I simply assumed this would be as well. It has been so many decades since I encountered inferior grade metal jewelry that I had honestly forgotten I was allergic to some metals. The metal composition is not detailed on the amazon listing. I posed a question to Amazon several days ago and have received no response. I waited for a response from amazon before posting a negative review to give them a fair shake at acknowledging the problem.  This is a glaringly obvious design fault that will surely be corrected in a future iteration. I may try it again then.",2
2096,"I’m thrilled with the Halo band. It is weird to not have a screen but I found it refreshing to not have another distraction. The fabric band is comfortable but I opted to purchase a sport band. The information and the feedback on the app is robust. The sleep section has been very informative for me as I have struggled with regular sleeping patterns for years. The BMI section is very motivating as well! I’m sure there will be updates to improve functionality (as with any new technology) but overall, I’m very excited about my Halo!",5
2097,"Early Adopter here: I enjoyed wearing this band and using the app. I thought it was innovative, interesting, and low profile. However, it was always finicky about setting it in the charging clip. A week ago it stopped charging. Both the device and the clip have been treated very gently. I am getting close to the last return date and I am not about to fuss with something that seems like a problem in the design or manufacturing.After attempting to submit this review, an escalated team contacted me in hopes of troubleshooting my problem. They told me that the initial support team was misinformed about the replacement options. I accepted a new chargint clip which arrived today. This did not resolve the problem.I contacted support again, and was again essentially offered a ""return now or lose the refund"" window. At this point, I have spent too much time fussing with a product that should simply work.I am disappointed because this is a good device concept and one I used nearly every day since late October 2020. I realize I am an early adopter and they may have shipped this early or I simply may have received a dud.",1
2098,"I don’t think this device is very user friendly. Using the “labs” was confusing. The battery life on this is TERRIBLE. I have to charge it a minimum of 2 times a week, sometimes 3. This device was disappointing and needs sone major updates to be able to compete with similar devices.",3
2099,I've had it for a month now or so and I like it but my only issue is where the sensor is on my wrist gave me a burn.  This is a first for me and I've had a couple other fitness trackers and none of them have done this. And I wear it non stop.,3
2100,So far I like the Halo. I have questions about accuracy but no fitness tracker is 100%. Besides the original Fitbit this is my first fitness tracker. I like the body scan and heart rate feature.,4
2101,Tracking steps is not accurate - gives two to three times the stepsWorked great for tracking sleep.After 10 months just stopped syncing so it doesn't work at all and warranty is closed,3
2102,"My phone is not able to complete body fat configuration, the app keeps freezing. All other metrics are pretty much useless. I don't even know who cares about sleep statistics and voice mood. I am going to give it one more try tomorrow.Update.Finally, I found that the device requires Android 7 or higher. But my phone with android 7 is not capable to run it. Also, the halo app and camera lens are doing all the job of fat tracking.I had a little bit higher expectations and some of the basic information wasn't explicitly mentioned in the advertisement materials.Conclusion: The device is great and feels good, but you can find plenty of other cheaper options on the market that will track your fitness activity.",2
2103,"Got mine in late Nov 2020. Loved it at first though I was frustrated that it didn't sync to any apps. In Feb 2021, the lens over the sensor came off and I attempted to get a replacement. Was told the warranty was out and there was nothing they could do. After speaking with another rep and I was told I could get a refund with return and nothing else. I haven't even completed paying for it. Very disappointed and will not be repurchasing. Also, the charger is terrible.",5
2104,"sleep tracking is all over the place , and seldom even close , the voice tracking seems worthless , says the same thing every day no matter what i was talking about or who.  at first I liked the body scan with body fat percentage , the first time I did it it seeded pretty acurate and it was close to my smart scale, . I did it again and acording to it my body fate had increased 5 points , , checked my smart scale , a change if less than one point and a weight change of less than half a pound activity points were easy to reach , got to the weekly goal in one to two days , and I am 70 years old so move a little less than I used to .  and now after just three weeks of use the charger will no longer work , the last couple of days it was really hard to get it to charge , today after 15 minnutes  of trying to get it o charge I gave up so it will be dead tomorow , still need to cancel the monthy fee that has not started yet",1
2105,It took a while to show the correct amount of calories being burned.  I know I burn more than 400 a day.  I think it needs improvement but the sleep part of the app is great,3
2106,"If the charger for the Halo were more user friendly and reliable, I would have rated this product five stars. However, it is a struggle to get it to actually charge. Yes, I know about pressing down on the clip to help it connect, but sometimes even that is ineffective. You may have to remove and replace the band on the charger several times to get it to connect and even then, you’d better look for that little red light after you walk away to make sure it stayed connected. All in all, a design flaw.",2
2107,"The concept is great but the product itself is terrible. I'm a pretty active guy, I'm always on the go, so during intense activity the halo Flys right off of the strap. So I don't even use it when im actually working out which defeats the purpose. It hardly ever sits right on my wrist when im doing moderate work outs so my heart rate and activity isn't even tracking. It works best when you aren't moving or asleep. Please people do not buy this product. It's a bad choice. You will not be happy with it..UPDATE:The battery life barely makes it a day, it'll also unsynch itself through out the day so it won't track progress,  I'll have to check it periodically to make sure it's actually working. The charger is also faulty, if you don't have it sitting right it won't charge. I mean it needs to sit JUST RIGHT, like Goldie locks and the three bears! I literally had it sitting on the charger for an hour before I realized it wasn't charging. -_-",1
2108,Will update later on but bought these on prime day. Bought 2 of them amd one of them doesn't have a working charger. Usi g the workable charger to see if it even or needs to be sent back,3
2109,Just got this band and it’s broken less than 2 weeks into it. Randomly unpaired itself from the app and it won’t reconnect. I’ve tried doing the factory reset and deleting and reinstalling the app and it’s not working. (And I’m a pretty tech savvy person so it’s not user error)The tracker seemed fairly reliable when reporting on my sleep habits and steps/activity per day. Sleep tracker didn’t report all sleep disturbances through the night just ones where I got out of bed.The mobile app is simple and easy to use.I’ve spent a ton of time trying to reconnect the thing. I’m thoroughly frustrated. This thing is going back. I’m going to just get an iwatch and call it a day. Sad because I wanted to love it.,2
2110,I love this band. I got it mostly for sleep and it is not disappointing. Only thing that could use improvement on is the voice recognition. If it could specify the specific phrase that sounded whichever. As well as specify how or why it sounded say dismissive. Otherwise it’s amazing. Not bulky and easy to wear 24/7 outside of when it needs to be charged which takes at most an hour when 20% or less. Highly recommend,5
2111,"I love it. Simple to use. Lots of programs and activities to choose from. Simplistic in design. Battery lasts almost a week when not using voice recognition. I used that feature for about a week and it wasn't very useful to me. Battery lasted a little under two days when voice was on. I do like the body scan a lot. How accurate is it? No one really knows, but it reminds me to take progress photos and that's all that counts to me. Very enjoyable experience so far.",5
2112,*Update: It's really hard to find info on transferring data to a new phone but it does transfer as long as you have recently synced to the old device and have cloud backup settings turned on before syncing to the new phone. Some more basic info here. https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GS9MVS3KY3BPV3NPI recently got a new phone and cannot transfer the data from my old device to the new one. It requires a factory reset. This makes no sense.,5
2113,"I bought the Halo on its initial release and had free membership for several months.  The voice drains the battery so I disabled it. The body imaging is a gimmick.  The thing I did like was the daily activity score as it kept me motivated to do more exercise. I was disappointed that the app wasn’t upgraded to support custom goals. Anyway, I didn’t think it was worth paying for the membership so cancelled today. Just realized that the only tracking I get is steps. No daily score, no targets. Here ends my use of the Halo.",2
2114,Charging is horrible! The design appears simple but I can’t get the connection. I’ve cleaned the band to make sure nothing is stopping it from charging and no luck!Very unhappy!,4
2115,Great tracker and gives you the basics.  Just what you need plus a cool tracker for the tone of your voice.,5
2116,My sleep doctor said he doesn't know how reliable the information is for your sleep. He said Amazon will not release their Algorithm for the sleep app.,3
2117,"Well, the step counter was inaccurate.  The battery loses its charge extremely fast. I've had the Halo for a month and a half and the battery won't charge any more. The band gets really dirty, really fast. As an early purchaser, the body scan wasn't available until last week. Definitely returning this product.",3
2118,"Last two workouts the band just decides to ignore my heart rate data? All I’m doing is putting my phone in the gym, running 200m JUST outside the gym, and then continuing my workout. And twice now it pauses and loses my heart rate data during the middle of the main WOD? Trash. Wondering if they’ll fix this or if I just need to go back to whoop. Whoop was designed in such a way where I could be without my phone for hours and do a workout, then when I got near my phone it uploads everything. Meanwhile with the Halo, I’m manually starting the workout on my phone only to get shafted on my data. Tough.",1
2119,"Body scans are a good feature - but the app is clunky and frequently crashes.  The heart rate monitor doesn’t accurately track my heart rate, particularly with HIIT workouts - my heart rate will elevate for the first minute and then according to the Halo go back to resting heart rate… and this is during intense weight lifting or sprint work.  Monitor works slightly better during runs.  Just isn’t reliable enough to warrant a purchase when there are better options",2
2120,"I tried the Amazon Halo for about a month, but honestly after I realized it didn't track sleep except that night everything else was lackluster. I work graveyard shift from 6:30 pm-5am. Sleep is difficult to begin with. Halo only tracks sleep between the hours of, I think, 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Halo have a monthly fee after the initial offering to see your stats. Honestly get a Fitbit or an Apple. I have a Fitbit, but wanted to try the body fat measurement the Halo claims to have. That's the same thing that can be done with a secondary app you take a picture of yourself and it gives you a guesstimate. I didn't like it, especially after I learned that it wouldn't track my sleep.",2
2121,"I was so excited to receive this band in the mail. It didn’t take long to realize what a let down it is. To start with, the band itself is very uncomfortable and hurts to wear. You have to wear the band tight for the heart sensor to even work. Even that doesn’t deliver live heart rate tracking on the app. The app will continually say the band needs to be readjusted. I am not sure if this is because I have tattoo sleeves on both arms and it effects the sensor? I have never had the issue before. The sleep tracking is also very inaccurate I have found.  The app is hard to navigate compared to the Apple health app or Fitbit app. I will be returning the band.",2
2122,Since purchasing the halo I have lost about ten pounds.  I love reaching my goals each week.  Due to covid I have been working from home and not realizing how much time I spend seated.  The amazon halo makes me more aware of this issue.  I enjoy the featured programs and helpful advice.  My favorite part is measuring and tracking my body fat.  It is a real eye opener.  I love my amazon halo!!!!  Thank you Amazon and keep up the good work!,5
2123,"This is a tough review to write because I really, really wanted to like the product. The only two positives that I can give the product are the color and sleek, slim design and the sleep tracking. Although the sleep tracker doesn't do any better than FitBit or Apple Watch, because it's lighter on your wrist, it's comfortable to wear all night. Other than those two items, there really isn't anything good about this product. And I repeat, I really wanted to like it. The fact that there is no watch component to it requires you to either wear a regular wrist watch on your other wrist or constantly check your phone. Same goes for tracking your workout or step count. You have to open up the app each time. It was the Body imaging software that really sold me on the product and why I bought it. I found it grossly inaccurate and others have told me that the type of undergarments you wear and how those fit on you influence it's reading of your body fat index. For the same price, I'd rather buy the FitBit Inspire. At a price point, that is the most comparable and it has way more features.",1
2124,I haven't yet tested out all the things it claims to do.  It is really easy to wear and the strap is really adjustable so it doesn't have to waver between too tight and too loose.  I don't even notice I'm wearing it.  It has a long charge life as well.  I like that it gives me different points based on how much I exercise and takes away points if I'm too sedentary.  I'm going to try out the body composition element next.,5
2125,"Halo was working as expected until it got wet, which it says can be worn in the shower or swimming. Now the sleep tracking function is not working well at all, one of the primary reasons I was interested in the product.",3
2126,Disappointed.  Stopped working after 3 months.,2
2127,"I love this tracker. My biggest complaint is charging it. It takes a lot if effort to get it on the charger. It is a nightmare. However, I love the device and its functionality.",4
2128,Broke 1 year and 1 month after purchase.  Device stopped taking a charge.,3
2129,"Smells awful on my skin after wearing it for less than a month. It would be helpful if Amazon would address how to clean it and get rid of the smell. The only instructions are to wipe it down with a cloth, but that doesn't get rid of the odor.",3
2130,"I like new gizmos and new tech: the exploring and the surprises. So I gave the halo a try. My old Fitbit does pretty much the same, except for the voice analysis. But it tells time. I got tired of wearing two devices. With voice analysis turned on, the halo does not have much of a battery life, with voice analysis turned off, why wear it?The sleep monitor function is pretty good but not worth the monthly halo fee. I wish I knew someone who wants a halo, otherwise, it will go to Goodwill.",2
2131,"I found the device to be pretty uncomfortable. I got it as an early trial but will be returning it. I already have an Series 6 Apple Watch, so I should have known better but between the discomfort, the weird charger and the difficulty to sync with Apple Health, it’s not for me.",3
2132,"Great band, so far have been using the sleep tracker and activity tracker, great data presentation.  Really liking the App and looking forward to using the BMI and tone features soon.Very comfortable, I wear it all day and all night and usually forget that it's on my wrist.  Very unobtrusive and zero digital distractions, which is perfect for me.Getting it into the charger consistently is a little squirrelly at first, but now can load it up no problem.  Could really benefit from a magnet type charger",5
2133,"I bought the Halo band, and then a few months later I had to buy a new phone. Everything was synced up perfectly at first. Then once my six month free trial ran out, I paid for the membership. On the Amazon account- it shows PAID under my subscriptions. But on my Halo app- it reads INACTIVE MEMBERSHIP. So I cannot access any of the membership features. I've deregistered, done factory resets, unpaired, paired- AND I CANNOT GET THE APP TO READ THAT I HAVE AN ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP. I would return it, but I'm way past that option. Need help!!!!!",2
2134,I have had fit bit and some cheaper models that did not last as long. This thing would charge but none of the times were correct. The instructions did not help at all. I am tossing it in the trash and am getting an Apple Watch. This is JUNK,1
2135,"I love this watch EXCEPT after a few months of wearing, it dies, and I mean dead.  It was fully charged but when you sweat too much (which you should be able to do with a fitness watch) the backing comes off the sensor and then it is doomed to only last another month or so.  I REALLY wish it was better made for people who really work out and I LOVED the point system which I can't seem to find otherwise, but I can't spend another $100....I've been through 2 of these trackers and hate that they are seemingly disposable. Sad!",2
2136,I purchased the first release of this tracker. I wore it simultaneously with my Fitbit. While there were slight variances.(Halo seems to count less steps)Overall I was pleased with the function of this tracker.My issue is it frequently loses connection with the phone/app. I never had it maintain a connection more than 4-5 days.And reconnecting it is a nightmare. definitely not something you can quickly do on the fly.The app itself is amazing. And constantly adding features.But due to the constant connection issues? I finally gave up. Went back to my Fitbit.,2
2137,"I laughed at some of the options, notably the “tone of voice” tracking. I’m NOT a person who is worried about privacy. If you are that concerned, nothing called a tracker is good for you. I turned off the voice analysis not due to privacy but it was so darn good it scared me. No kidding - dead on.Everything about this unit - sleep, activity, heart rate has been accurate. The app is super easy and helpful. My only issue is NOT wanting to remove it to charge it.",5
2138,I would love to love this product because the app is a good idea but there are a lot of issues with it. The band its self is just annoying to me. Unfortunately I find it annoying that every time I want to check my progress I have to get my phone out and pull up the app. This is inconvenient when at work or trying to work out. Another issue in the app is that it doesn't have goals. The goals are a weekly average which I don't personally like. When I see goals I want daily goals to reach like a certain number of steps or walk up x flights of stairs or get x amount of rigorous exercise. I dont want to just get points based off of an algorithm that the user doesn't know. I do like the tone reader aspect. That could be improved by telling me what words I used that sounded angry or happy or nervous. Not the whole phrase but if I know what words it heard then maybe I will remember what I was complaining about or happy about.,1
2139,"I like some of the features and some of the analysis it gives you, however I would use it as a secondary tracker. Doesn't allow you to track a particular workout and step count is always way below what my fitbit shows. I'd rate it as just ok",3
2140,"It's uncomfortable because you're supposed to wear it on the inside of the wrist, so it gets in the way of everything, including typing on a keyboard. The app functionality is limited: it doesn't track HR over time, only peak and baseline HR. The activity tracker is not granular enough; it only reports per hour. There's no O2 saturation sensor. Sleep tracking is its best feature, but doesn't make the product worth it by itself. The body composition actually has nothing to do with the watch-- you just stand in front of you smart phone in your underwear while it does some visual analysis. Don't bother with this watch- there are better products/apps on the market.",2
2141,"This thing is great! Ive tried Fitbit, and the Samsung Gear. This works just as well, if not better with the sleep temperature AND the tone monitor. I do like that the others have a screen, but this one is still pretty awesome!I'm also allergic to latex. These other brands do not have an ingredients list on their bands. When I wear their bands, I break out in hives. I do not break out with this one! I will sacrifice the screen for not breaking out. Thank you, Amazon!",5
2142,I think this is a good product. But I’m kindaLeery on the Voice Recognition part as far as the accuracy of it otherwise the sleep tracking works good.,4
2143,I love this thing.  Love the band.  I love that it has no face.  The tracking features are awesome and the price is fantastic.  I haven't used the tone feature so battery lasts for days.  I highly recommend and I tell everyone that thru should get one.  Oh yeah you can't beat the price.  Go..get one... now! 😀,5
2144,Poorly designed product from Amazon . Battery life causes frequent charging,2
2145,I don’t like that the battery dies so quickly while using the voice recognition. But the tone tracker is also the part IIke best.  I also like the sleep tracker.,4
2146,"**update 2**I received another band, maybe my first was defective. No, the band is just bad tech. I don't know why you have to stay back at square 1 when the band unpairs with the app. You literally have to create a profile each time it does this. And it has Bluetooth problems every day. The longer it went without the issue was 2 days.**update*""Did it again tonight. 3 days owned, three days having Bluetooth connection issue. To fix you have to factory reset. I love Amazon but this is complete garbage!!!!!!!I have had this for 2 days now and each morning I get a message saying that the Bluetooth had a problem and needs to repair. The only way to do this is to do a factory reset which erases your data. So I have nothing to show for 2 days. I got this free and a free 6 month membership and I still don't think this is worth free. If this gives me the issue today I'm sending it back.",1
2147,Love this band. It took a little time getting use to not having a watch face but I really like it.It fits my wrist SO MUCH BETTER than any smart watch I've had. The sleep tracking isn't perfect but it's the best one I've tried and it's pretty accurate.The tone thing didn't appeal to me so I haven't tried it.The body scanning is kinda funny but I think it's a great way to measure progress.I also enjoy the programs and workouts.,5
2148,"Initially, I loved it. All the things it tracks are great and seem accurate. Unfortunately after only 6 months, the battery quit taking a full charge so was exhausting the battery life very quickly. Sad I had to return.",2
2149,Great for keeping accountability during verbal exchanges. Limits my bloodpressure so I have to take it off from the choking effect. Not good for highly sensitive person(s).,3
2150,"I use my halo mostly to track my physical activity, sleep tracker, and heart beats per minute. I don’t like how short the battery lasts and how difficult it is to set it in the charger",4
2151,"I have been using the Halo to track my sleeping as well as my physical activity since November 2020, everything was going fine until about 2 weeks ago. I had just finished a run and was excited to see how many activity points I had accumulated, to my surprise the app had only a few points and seemed to stop tracking at about 6pm that day. Thinking that was odd, I took off the band and had a look to see if the green light was flashing; there was no light flash but the glass had actually come off the bottom of the Halo. I pushed the glass back in and tried to reconnect by pushing the button 2 times but it did nothing; even after doing the pairing process again, the Halo shows that it is fully charged but it does not measure my heart rate nor is the green light flashing underneath. I am really disappointed because up to that point the Halo was doing perfectly fine and I had actually been recommending it to my family and friends. Too bad I guess.",1
2152,"I've been using a fitness tracker for over 15 years, I started with a body bug, then fitbit, then apple watch and now a halo.  and I'd give the halo an ok.  It seems to be pretty accurate and has a few nice features, but I am not sold on it.  I miss not being able to look at a screen and see the time or who's calling (like on my other fitness trackers).  In order to see how many steps I've take or to see any details, I need my phone to look at the app.  So, overall....it's ok.  I wouldn't buy again and I don't believe I'll keep paying the charge for monthly access.",2
2153,"Overall, I feel like this watch was cheaply made, or just not ready to be launched yet. I regret not getting the Apple Watch instead of this to track my fitness.After only 6 months of use, the bottom, sensor part came off rendering it useless. While it worked, I liked having a sleep and step tracker, but I was underwhelmed by the other features. For example, the voice recognition and fat percentage features seemed inaccurate. Canceling the 6 month app trial was also a pain, because I had to contact customer service in order to cancel, and at first they didn’t know how to do it.",2
2154,"Without even a basic screen it can share time or notifications.  The voice tone information is great.  Battery life ia good, but needs the proprietary charger.  Would buy again if they add a basic e-ink display for time and maybe basic notifications.",3
2155,I like everything that comes with the Halo band. The only negative i have is I still have to wear a watch due to working in the healthcare field. If it had the face in it out would be better. It would also be great to see texts and phone calls.,3
2156,"I got this for Christmas and I was really excited about it. I’ve been using it for 6 months and I hate it. First off, the tone feature is horrible. No matter what I’m doing, it puts me in the unhappy category. I even tried to reset it thinking I must have done the baseline wrong. No dice. It says I’m “subdued” at best, even when laughing and playing with my children. The other features work well enough, but you have to keep paying for the membership for life or else this thing becomes less helpful than a $10 generic fitness bracelet. I assumed the membership was for the library of workouts, meditations, etc. But no. You must pay $3.99 per month forever to keep access to your body scans, sleep data, and movement details. Not worth it. Also it didn’t even notify me that my membership was expiring. I just opened the app one morning, and all it shows me is my steps and a few other basic things. I would never have purchased this and it will be going on the trash heap.",1
2157,"I haven't had any issues with charging, and I understood all it did before I bought it... So those aren't my issues but my wrist hurts.. I don't have it on tight,, it's loose but it's causing me physical wrist pain? Not sure the reason...?",3
2158,I have loved my Halo. The active points per week and body scan have helped me over the past month to start to make better habits. The sleep score and labs have allowed me to start making better sleep decisions to improve my sleep. The tone of voice has allowed me to slow down and really pay attention to what I'm saying. I enjoy that there are not push updates to the band and I can control when I look at it on the app. I really do love everything about this!,5
2159,"The device is unable to keep accurate heart rate while doing CrossFit/functional fitness type workouts. During these workouts my heart rate is well into the intense range anywhere from 15-30 minutes but the band has my heart rate barely in the moderate range. With that said, as soon as I finish the workout and stop moving, the band catches up and the reflected heart rate with the live feature reflects a more accurate reading. If tracking your workout intensity is important then I recommend investing in other products.",5
2160,"It has a hard time with my sleep tracking, but I believe it is due to my variety of sleep patterns, it doesn't like it when you sleep in 4 hours shifts multiple times a day.",4
2161,"I don't see what people are griping about, I think some are just being too picky. This thing is way better than a stupid Fitbit, Fitbit would never calculate steps correctly for me. Apple Watch is useless for me. Halo band has all the features that I was looking for. It fits comfortable, it's only tight if you make it tight, I have it above the wrist bones as directed to do and it has not budged all day or hurt.  Overall this has been an awesome purchase for me.",5
2162,I absolutely loved mine but had to return it. My primary reason I got it was for the sleep tracking but it would say i only slept for 2-3 hours a night and my sleep score was 24 or under. I am thinking it is because i am an extremely active sleeper. I move so much it probably didn't know i was sleeping. I was very pleased with the mobile app and the tone monitor.,5
2163,"counting steps can be done with a  mobile app for free,live heart rate monitor is nice but the sleep monitor is terrible and that was the mainreason for my purchase. 2/5",3
2164,"I have literally bought every single Amazon product since Alexa, And I have to say this is one of my favorite products. I Have had the Apple Watch, And some other Fitbit type watches, and the simplicity of this is just brilliant. No need to squint and struggle to look at a tiny screen.  When you feel like looking at your steps for the day or seeing your heart rate live, you just tap the app on your smart phone and get all of the vital statistics. Easy as that.",5
2165,The sleep tracking is the best I have used (much better than Garmin and Sleep-On).  The body image software very inaccurate.  Voice recognition not useful for me.,3
2166,"It's pretty informative, easy to wear, and the app has a bunch of content to help you with sleep, weight, and mental management. I find the data to be useful especially the sleep tracking.",4
2167,Sleep tracking is probably the best of the data points. Activity you have to dig around on the app the find your heart rate stats. Voice Tone is cool at first but I hardly look at it any more.The app itself is ok and there are a lot of useful hints and tools but of course those will all cost money as will having the halo itself. I didn’t think that a membership would be needed. A lot of the other fitness trackers don’t have that and have many more features than Halo. I won’t likely “renew” if there will be a cost for membership. This will go In the food will pile.,2
2168,I like everything about this except that it should come with an extra band for when  I wash one .The charging clip is unique.Customer service is great! Jacob was so patient.,4
2169,"Loved the color and simplicity of the band. App and band worked decently enough. Step tracker was a little off from my Active2 watch.Sleep tracking stopped working after 3 months. Tech support wasn't much help. Kept telling me to reset the band, re-install the app, etc. Noting worked. I'm sure the band was still tracking sleep but it was no longer able to communicate with th app.App is clunky. App. Is not well organized. Features don't pop, and it's hard to see information quickly.Really wanted this to be everything it was advertised to be. But Samsung has them beat. Went back to my Active2. Will not be renewing after my free trial is up.",2
2170,"I really love the point system as I feel like it captures a broader range of activity. Not a big fan of the body scan, but it might grow on me with more consistent use.",4
2171,I really like this product. I have enjoyed it for the past several months. The sleep tracking is good and I like how it keeps up with my exercise and body shape.I had an issue with my band.  Customer service contacted me and sent me a new band.  I look forward to many more years of use. I love this thing.,5
2172,"It's great! No annoying screen, very affordable, and the tracking seems to be very accurate. Has helped me with fitness and sleep.",5
2173,"The body fat analyzer is the only good part and it really doesn't need the Halo. I also think it runs a little bit high for my body type (ectomorph). The sleep tracking is awful. I determines I went to sleep 4 hours after I'm asleep. The charger is very hard to get seated correctly and today no amount of jiggling will get it to charge. The ""voice analyzer"" drains the battery when on and even then only samples periodically. I am somewhat biased as I have a Versa 2 and use that for the basic functions like step counting and sleep tracking. I wanted to try the Halo for body fat and voice and to see how it tracked sleep and steps with the Versa.",2
2174,"Definitely what I'm looking for, but battery life is not very good... Have to charge every 3 days",4
2175,"I have tried fitbts, including the Versa.  But I was always checking it.  I much appreciate the charge it and forget it Halo.  I usually sync it once a day, in the morning to check my sleep.  I will still use my versa when I want to listen to music while I exercise, although I have a home gym and usually listen to tv.But after a couple weeks, the pink band looks a little dirty.  Will have to see about replacing it.",5
2176,I should have researched more about the halo band before I purchased it. I thought it was more like a fit bit but liked that it could be worn in the pool snd shower.,3
2177,I like my Halo and can't wait to see the difference in what my CPAP and Halo are when I go back to the doctor. Still learning about the other options with the Halo,4
2178,I am about to change deviceIt has not let me re subscribre,2
2179,"I’ve had halo for 3 months and here are the issues that I have with it:for some reason it thinks that I am doing very intense activity with heart rate over 190 (see the picture attached when I drove for an hour) when I am simply driving the car so my activity data is garbage. Tone analyzer is a very cool feature but it depletes battery in no time plus when I talk not in English it throws it off. Lastly, it’s not comfortable to wear.Overall, I like the idea and I think that over few product generations Amazon can improve it but today I am taking it off (missed the window to return it)",2
2180,"I really like this tracker.  Has some very different features, like the body mass scan.  Seems to be more accurate when tracking steps than some of the others I have used.  I have one negative and that is I really miss having a watch face on it and being able to press a button, or whatever to see how my steps, etc are for the day  Seems I don't have to charge it as often as my last tracker.  Really pleased with this product",5
2181,"Like it but but wish I could add more things instead of a limit.  Battery is good, mic is good. Im a newbie at these watches so i would recommand it.",4
2182,"If you decide to wear this for 24 hours a day, the unit needs to be charged almost every day.  Except for having to charge this often, I am very pleased.",4
2183,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 This was listed as a fitness tracker with tone recognition tht is a lie it listens for the words u use title was a lie so disappointed waste of money I needed it medically for a seizure disorder total let down SCAM DONT BUY",1
2184,"Just randomly came across this product shopping on amazon one but with my cancelation went thru now. I actually tried to cancel it since i wasn't sure about it but it didn't go thru and shipped. Gave it a shot since i got it however at 1st things were ok besides trying to the app but before writing this review, i hated the products. I don't know if it was the product or just the charger but it wasn't charing at all unless i messed with it. Just overall the app was confusing for me, the product sucked, and at the end of it somehow it got disconnected. Just saw on the app my band was disconnected but nothing i did to fix it worked and trying to resync it and set it up again was like the final straw. I just gave up on it and now its in storage debating to just cut my losses and throw it away or not but if you're thinking of getting this, might want to look around 1st.",1
2185,"I liked this product quite a bit the first three months. Sleep tracker worked well, activity trackers was great.However, now it takes 5-7 hours to charge when it used to take under and hour. And it syncs incorrectly all the time- for example it’ll say I slept 3 hours when it was more like 7 but not indicate that there was a sleep or connectivity disruption- it just syncs wrong. And this happens daily now, not just a one time issue.Planning to cancel the membership and get rid of this thing.",2
2186,"Needed to re-sync, it wouldn't",2
2187,"Fine product, on par with a Fitbit. Would never replace my Apple Watch though. Lacking a time feature and the sizing of bands is confusing and not variable enough. Returned this, I’ll stick with Apple Watch. Also hurts, wore it two days and ended up with a bruised wrist.",3
2188,"Seed to work well - for about a week. Then I couldn't get it to charge. Tried for a while to get the contacts lined up in the charging clip, but to no avail. Finally returned it. Could be good if I could reliably power it.",3
2189,"I love my Halo, unapologetically. It does what it says it will do and does it well. I have never had trouble with the bands (fabric or silicone), find that it does a decent job of guessing what activity I'm doing, and the sleep information is invaluable. I am a big fan of the labs that you can use for exercise and to improve sleep. I'm very pleased with it.",5
2190,The band works very well and I have purchased more for my adult kids.  I do not use the tone feature becasue it uses too much battery,4
2191,So I got the Halo for sleep tracking and tone perception but the microphone kills the battery. I was really disappointed that you really can’t do both. You have to charge it every night when you use the microphone which means you cannot track your sleep. Disappointed.,3
2192,"I tried this activity tracker because it was on sale at a discounted price.It works great, I really like the step/ activity tracker as well as the sleep tracking. The tone monitor gave me a good chuckle but not sure I'd pay extra for that on the app.Unfortunately the band is very bulky which makes it very uncomfortable to wear and especially to sleep in. It is also quite unattractive. I thought I could wear it with my bracelet stack (like you can the apple watch) but it just doesn't look fashionable, even with the additional accessory band I purchased.I would recommend waiting to purchase the Halo until the next generation when hopefully these features are improved.",2
2193,"Not really as excited when I got it. Not comfortable to sleep with for sleep tracking, so I just stopped using it altogether and got an Iwatch instead. Sorry, I really wanted to love this band!",3
2194,Love the sleep tracking. Fitness exertion and tracking lacks. Would love more detail in my activities rather than points as a professional athlete. Looking at WHOOP for better in-depth analysis.,4
2195,"Works ok, but there is no watch part, and I don't like wearing 2 separate devices on my wrists, nor do I like digging my phone out to see what time it is. If you just want to wear it for sleep & exercise, its great.",3
2196,"I can’t provide any feedback on the measurements, because I wore this for less than 24 hours. What I wanted to share is actually how huge and uncomfortable it is. It hurts my wrist and it looks like a huge bandage. I will most likely return it :(",3
2197,I thought the app for the most part was good and the insights were insightful. I liked the Halo a lot. The issue is with the hardware and durability. After a few months it just stopped charging. No matter what I did I could not get it to charge up. I will need to reach out to Amazon and get it replaced but haven’t done so yet.,2
2198,Want to turn off tone. It doesn’t even stay 100%. I wake up and it’s on 70% all ready.,4
2199,But the app sucks.,4
2200,"I've been using this for over 4 months.  I miss seeing the time, my heart rate, and steps as I'm working out.  But it does seem to track workout efforts very well.  I've only done one body scan.  I wish you could drill down into sleep data a bit more, like Fitbit does.  Overall I think this provides a good capture of data, and I like the Healthy Habits and Get Moving under the Discover tab.",5
2201,I can’t believe Amazon with all its resources launched an app in such poor form. Way too many clicks. No easy navigation. A true task to accomplish anything and sadly turned me against the product as a whole.  Will go back to fit bit.,3
2202,"Amazing! I know exactly how many calories I have burned daily. I can track the details of my sleep patterns, after an important meeting I can go back and check my time. The body scan is waaaay too accurate for me! But, I need to know. The lean muscle vs. fat is very helpful for me to make changes to my diet with regards to protein from week to week",5
2203,"I like the capabilities of the Halo, but I find the pairing of my phone with the Halo band very frustrating.  I had a problem pairing it during initial setup, which was eventually solved.  After two months of satisfactory use, the band disconnected itself.I then had another difficult time pairing it.  Viewing the troubleshooting info on the Amazon site was helpful, but it still wouldn't pair.  An hour and a half later, after several iterations of deleting the Halo app and downloading it again, turning Bluetooth off and then on, and going through the process of factory reset, it finally paired.If I have to go through this again, I'll buy a Fitbit.",2
2204,"This is a waste of money. I think since the last update my band does not sync correctly with my mobile app. There is not one time when it doesn't ask me to try again because it was unable to sync. When it does, my activities are, more often than not, not there. This is with the paid membership, which I have just cancelled. Don't even think about not syncing everyday... The mobile app will just say 'oops it looks like you weren't wearing your band'. None of these things were true on launch (had this since January 2021).",2
2205,"After 6 months of daily use the heart rate monitor has progressively gotten less accurate.Was a 1 star, let the battery fully drain and recharged it. Seems to be more accurate right now.",3
2206,"Not able to view data on the Halo. You can only view on the app. Since I don’t carry my phone around the house, I felt at a disadvantage as compared to my Fitbit. Battery life not great. Every 2 days had to charge.",3
2207,I really like this product because of the tone and sleep tools.  It's lightweight and comfortable to wear for an extended time. My only qualm is how often it needs to be charged.,4
2208,"I am happy with the Halo itself; however, I think there's a problem with the charger it came with. It won't charge, and now I can't use the Halo.",4
2209,"Battery life to short, sleep tracking stops at the first time I get up to go to the bathroom witch can be several times a night since I’m 70 y/o.",4
2210,"Absolutely love this!! It super motivating, love every work out, meditation, tips and more in the app. I really hope they add more Sweat work outs since there are only about 10. It’s so easy to meet your targets with the videos included. Very accurate on the sleep tracking, not so sure about the voice recognition I never seem to sound happy according to the app. I must add I have used Apple Watch, Fitbit and Polar and this is by far my favorite device.",5
2211,I really like how accurate it tracks my sleep and steps. Room for improvement can be a visible clock and interchangeable wristbands (the pink one shows dirt quickly).,4
2212,"I'm not big on technology and never thought I would own something like this, but received one when I joined WW. I love it and it is both amazing (and kinda scary) how much it can tell us about our BMI, daily activity, sleep patterns etc. It is the most simple but best gadget I've ever owned. Wow!",5
2213,"Perfect for me.  I’m not super athletic I was looking for something to motivate myself to be more active, track progress, and check on with my overall wellness.",4
2214,There are a several interesting functions. The app is really good and constantly improving,4
2215,I spent a long time comparing the features of devices. I was granted an early release Halo and love it. It has all the features I wanted without all the bloat. I needed simple sleep tracking and BMI once I am cleared to start an exercise regimen. There are some features lacking and assume that they will come in time. Or I just haven't found them yet. I would like to see some sort of calorie or food tracking that is a companion to the excerise programs.,5
2216,"I like the size but the no screen was a problem, I cant wear two devices so the time would be handy. Also she always says I’m in a bad mood which unless I spoke like a baby seemed to not change.",3
2217,"The pink woven band is very pretty and fastens securely and comfortably...but it gets dirty very easily, even from the oils on your skin, and does not clean up easily.",4
2218,I didn’t expect the halo to do too much. But it really seem to do better than any other tracker how we slept. And the tone it’s a fascinating idea.  I was hoping to be able to use it with kids on the autism spectrum to help them understand emotions of others but it’s really only for emotions for yourself. Even that would be valuable.,5
2219,"I purchased this for my husband so he could better track his sleeping habits. It is amazing! Super great because it doesn't have a screen that may light up and wake you up, plus it is super comfortable to wear even when sleeping (I've tried it out ;)). 100% recommend just for that feature!",5
2220,"I really wanted to like this activity tracker, I was excited to purchase an affordable tracking device. I have had 2 so far and both have fallen apart within 4 and 6 months. The best part of the this debacle is that Amazon's solutions have been to either wait 2 months for a POS refurbished product or pruchase another new device at full price so I can be reimbursed for the current POS!! I purchased an extended warranty with the original device! This is unbelievable!! I am not going to purchase another defective, POS device, I'm returning this POS, cancelling my membership, filing a complaint with the BBB and sending all correspondence to the regulators who oversee these organizations. Great job Amazon/WW, you sell a defective product that falls apart and then require your customers to purchase ANOTHER DEFECTIVE PRODUCT instead of just sending the customer a product THAT WORKS!! Isn't there a law against ""bait and switch"" sales tactics!!  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!",1
2221,"I want to like this band because it has some interesting features, but I just can't. The battery life is abysmal if you're tracking your tone. I had to charge it twice in a day once and a daily charge seemed to be the norm when using the feature.The worst part about the Halo is it snaps into the band which can lead to ""what happened to the Halo?"" scenarios as you notice you're wearing an empty band. I managed to find it in the bed the first time it happened, but this time it is MIA as it is either in the yard someplace or was kicked under some furniture. Not a great feature for a $100 device.",2
2222,Very hard to get things set up on your phone. Many times tried voice activation failed Every time. Bluetooth not strong or defective unit. But I give it a 3. Not a great band at all and I have had many. Returning it back to Amazon,3
2223,Wish it has a watch. I see now they have a new one coming out that shows the time. Wish I would’ve waited.,3
2224,It didn’t do a good job for sleeping. I go to bed at 11 pm but often it shows I went to bed at 6 pm🤦‍♂️,3
2225,All around great fitness tracker. Only thing preventing that 5th star is no watch face.,4
2226,"Seems to stop tracking if a little sweaty. If I start to do high intensity exercise, it loses data. I only discover this after the workout and then have to manually enter any activity because it wasn't tracked. Also sleep doesn't seem to match actual experience.",3
2227,The battery does not last nearly as long as advertised. Voice recognition is pretty good.,4
2228,"I love the idea of the available features, just haven't learned about how to use them all.",4
2229,"An over priced pedometer with a subscription attached. The Tone feature cannot detect very well AT ALL.  I deleted it after it detected my voice as J.Rogan's voice over the entire period of his podcast and received weird ""analysis"" of ""my"" tone.Do you need an app to remind youself how fat you look in a mirror or the general shape of you in the public eye? This is it.  Wanna know if your fat? Look in a the mirror;  even ask someone ?  Take pictures of your fatness and carry it around with you in your pocket or purse. Show your friends easily!  Had an invite and this is not a joke review. Buyer Beware.",2
2230,"The more I use this the more I find that I love and I have just started. The only dislike is that there is no screen on it, I don't necessarily need it for looking at my stats but I have used a Fitbit for so long I don't wear a normal watch. If they had a version where a screen was optional that would be perfect.",5
2231,Went out of town and thought that I could use my normal iPhone charging block!!! Nope wrong incorrect! I get Apple and Amazon are two totally different companies but I thought the charging block is pretty much universal technology! However my assumption was totally wrong! I tried other none Apple blocks and it didn’t work. I later leaned it  Only worked with this anker block I Left at home! My halo totally died and was not able to use it !,5
2232,"This has got to be one of the worst-designed chargers. Every time I have to charge the device, I have to solve a puzzle to align the charging points.Overall the product is mediocre for the price you pay. Sleep tracking is highly ineffective; it shows me awake at random times during the night. The only explanation could be that I am sleepwalking, and nobody knows about it.Activity monitoring is again random. When I try to pat my baby to sleep, it counts as an intense exercise while I am sitting on the bed. The concept of activity points is not intuitive and seems to be random again.",2
2233,"I'll bet you've never knew you sounded like such a b**** until you followed your voice tracking on this little eavesdropping nightmare from hell. Seriously, it seems to keep track of all different phases of sleep and timing and many subtle tones of voice broken into subcategories as well as steps and activity level. A freaking miracle at this price point. in a few months we'll have to pay a tiny bit every month for monitoring but that's okay",5
2234,The product is wonderful.....the sleep tracking  could be better....battery life is A-1....the app is full of stuff some not useful but a lot of options..body scan needs improvement...needs to link with other apps in case you forget to wear it,3
2235,I like everything the watch does. I bought it for my wife and she says it’s uncomfortable and digs into her arm. It took a little while to get used to.,4
2236,I love all the features. I just wish it would sync with the fit bit app since it's very uncomfortable to wear both at the same time.,4
2237,"So who do I talk to about this???Never exposed to water, lotions or other substances.  Never dropped or bumped into anything.Disappointed as I bought this in November and have loved using it.",3
2238,"The overall layout of the app is cool. The 3d body portrait with weight increase and decrease sliding scale is awesome. The tone monitor, does not consider differences in ethnicity and response. The sleep tracker sucks it does not detect short naps or mid day.",3
2239,I have to charge every other day.  That is the only thing I dont like,4
2240,"Still trying to understand how to use it according to my lifestyle, but good so far.",4
2241,BMI and sleep are great: activity measures are OK (within 5% of a fitbit) Really needs a display so you can measure progress on the go w/o a cell phone,4
2242,"This was very disappointing and a waste of money. I bought specifically for its unique tone tracking but the feature just doesn't work. It's very difficult to get it to actually work passively. It would almost never pick up my convos, and active tracking isn't very useful either plus can't be used if you're talking on the phone. If you back out the tone tracking I would've never bought this device as it doesn't offer a good value outside of that unique feature. There are other superior options for bio-tracking.",2
2243,I wish there was a way to clean the band to make it look new again,3
2244,Love the detail of the sleep tracking function.  As a light sleeper it has helped me analyze my sleep to better gauge deep sleep versus rem and the time it takes me to fall asleep.  Not to mention the ability to see interruptions during the night.  Good healthy sleep is a key foundation to anyone looking to get in better shape.  Recommend the Halo app as one of the best on the market right now.,5
2245,"It seems to work well enough, but there are some extras that they suggest you try, and I can’t seem to always go back to the one I was interested in. You can only have so many active at a time so when I finished one I wanted to try one I’d seen earlier but was unable to find it again. They need to have a way to mark ones your interested in and keep them saved for you.",5
2246,The functionality on this is ok but unfortunately it didn't meet my needs.  As a more serious fitness enthusiast it lacks things such as HRV.  It would be great for a beginner looking to get moving.,3
2247,"I got the medium size Halo, and was initially pleased -- for about 1.5 days. The data was neat. This was the most advanced ""fitness band"" product I owned, and it was a big step up from a simple footstep counter. But the form factor isn't great. The band isn't easy to put on and take off. (Elastic would be better). The device is a bit uncomfortable to wear, too, kind of pinching the wrist.Worst of all, though, it lost sync on day 2, none of the troubleshooting advice worked, and I am giving up. It won't resync and won't reset so I can try setting it all up all over again. Basically, it's dead to me.",2
2248,The app doesn’t notify you anything. If you didn’t do anything they don’t send any notification. Something that I’m the video it's subliminal,3
2249,"It just wasn’t what they made it out to be, you still need to do a lot of things manually that marketing give the impression is automatic, just prefer the Fitbit over this immensely.The voice recognition drains the battery life",3
2250,"Most comfortable tracker I've ever worn. Band is fabric but semi elastic and has a slim profile. Also has a velcro strap adjustment as opposed to notches and a pin.  Impressive app that has an easy to use infograpics and you can dive as deep as you want on data.  Have not enabled listening mode, as I have an infant and toddler and know exactly how I sound all day.  But, with it disabled, battery is at 55% after 5 days!",5
2251,"I do really love this band. Although I cannot get the voice part to work :( The photo part is cool how it transforms my personal pics into a 3D model and shows how much you have changed with each update... so cool. I also really love the ""labs"" with different exercises and the sleep ones have been helpful. It's light on my wrist and only needs to charge it once a week or so. Overall happy with it.",5
2252,"I purchased this tracker to see what my sleep patterns and work outs were like, it has been a great tool to learn more about my habits. I’ve adjusted my bedtime to get more sleep and that has really helped me overall. I can also keep track of how intense my workouts are so I know how many calories I need to keep me going.",5
2253,Mobile app has lots of neat features and insights,5
2254,"Not particularly aesthetically pleasing, but fairly accurate.  I’m not sure how valuable the information is to my everyday life.  I like getting my steps, heart rate and sleep patterns. However, I can’t see myself paying for this after the free trial ends.",3
2255,I love the Halo. It does exactly what I wanted. It tracks sleep accurately and helps you sleep better by giving suggestions that might work for you. Workout feature it also really neat and breaks down exactly how intense your workouts are. Even cleaning the house will register on the device and give you points for being active. All of it matters and adds up!,5
2256,"I love my Halo! It does a great job at sleep tracking. I haven’t used the voice recognition feature, but it’s nice that it has that option if I wanted it. It also tracks activity, which I find useful. It’s easy to charge and the battery life is good. I usually charge it every 5 days, or so. It charges quickly too. I am glad I chose the Halo for my tracker!",5
2257,My biggest complaint is the cloth band… I wore it and got it stained when painting and now it forever is stained. Other competitive devices allow for interchangeable bands,3
2258,So far it tracks my sleep very well and my steps more accurately than my fitbit.,4
2259,"I’ve had my new one about a year (got one of the first out and it was buggy, but Amazon immediately replaced), and I keep falling more in love with the sleep scoring feature.  I track it daily and am becoming really mindful of what helps and impedes good sleep for me.  It captures so many dimensions of sleep - amazing!! I also find the daily and weekly activity points motivating but hands down I love the sleep scoring the best!",5
2260,"Mainly wanted this to track sleep but it hasn't been overly accurate. Often thinks I'm asleep if in bed, unless the light is turned on. It also subtracted points for being sedentary when I was awake most of the night but stayed in bed.. guess I should have gotten up  & run around the house even though it was the middle of the night. Worst issue is that I've only had it for 3 weeks & for the 3rd time, it's refusing to sync. Shouldn't have to keep starting over like I just received it. Will be returning it. Hubby is in IT & he says it's ridiculous & he is tired of trying to fix it.",2
2261,I love this device! The only thing I would change or ask for is ovulation/period tracking. The app would be perfect with those additions.,4
2262,"I liked this device, until the charger stopped functioning.  It's not even 6 months old, still in my free trial period.  Not going to continue on past the  6 month offer.  Wish I could get my money back.",3
2263,The halo band seems to be very surface level and is definitely an entry level smart band. Still early.,3
2264,"I have an apple watch that I wear during the day, but I use this to track my sleep and my sleep quality. I love how it works. I only have to charge it once every 8 or 9 days. It has given me a lot of useful information.",5
2265,"Edited 25 January 2021,I'm editing my review and taking my rating down to one star from three.  My Halo has stopped tracking my sleep.  I can't recommend something that simply doesn't work.  If the functionality of later models improves I might consider buying another Halo, but it will be quite some time before I do.-----------------I bought this to track the quality of my sleep; I sleep during the night 10pm - 6am.  When it works it seems extremely accurate, at least for measuring  what I can verify like time to sleep, disturbances, etc.  Based on that I have a high confidence in the measurements of sleep stages I can read in the app.However, if I let the battery get below 50% it won't track anything and all fields remain blank in the morning.  Hence my 'meh' 3 star rating.This is the first fit tracker I've bought.  There seem to be a lot of interesting features that I don't use, at least not yet.  If the tracking functionality were more reliable I'd give it 5 stars.",1
2266,I liked that it was comfortable and very accurate sleep tracker. The lighter band gets dirty very easily. And I wish it also told the time! I kept looking at my wrist expecting to see the time...,3
2267,"I really enjoyed the sleep tracking and voice recognition. I also like the smaller design. This is where it ends.I didn't care for the app, I didn't find it user friendly in terms of navigation. I don't like how it doesn't interact with any other apps or equipment. I also don't like that you have to pay a monthly fee to receive what I would think should be basic features.I also could not wear it for more than 12 hours or I would get a bruise on my wrist.",2
2268,"I bought this in the hopes of getting a good fitness tracker and liked the idea of activity points. But it didn't live up to expectations.First, the fit is not good. Either the band is really tight, or slides around on the wrist.The app takes some getting used to, but it's ok.My two main problems were the accuracy of the heart rate and the activity points.I compared the live heart rate on the app to one on my pulse oximeter. The heart rate on halo was frequently underestimating the heart rate during exercise, sometimes by as much as 30-50 beats. (Pulse ox heart rate was 130s, whereas halo would report as 90s).Second, the points. I monitored my HR on the app during exercise, and it was measured 130s to 150s for about 10 minutes. After exercising, I checked the activity. Halo didn't give me any intense points (which it should have). One or two nights it registered my sleep as sedentary activity and took of points for sleeping.Although the points system looks good on paper, it works mostly as a demotivator on this device. Will be returning.",1
2269,Stopped charging after 1 year,3
2270,"I was really happy with how comfortable this was to wear all the time. Other trackers bothered my skin and I would always take them off. I actually wear this all the time, and so it's working well. I do not use the tone function and when I tried to use the body fat part it didn't work, which is probably for the best, but I'm happy with the fitness and sleep tracking.",5
2271,Sleep accuracy is not great. Does not record when one goes back to sleep or takes a nap. Sometimes is missing activity recording when long walks are taken.,4
2272,"Do not buy this. It's a waste of money and basically garbage. I received this at the end of October of last year so you can see it's not even been a year and the thing only stays charged a day and a half. It doesn't track accurately. 30 minutes of a workout will only show up as 15 minutes on my app. Every day activities such as folding laundry will show up as a 15 minute workout. Something I don't even exert myself in. I never thought I'd find a tracker worse than fitbit, but yet here we are.",2
2273,The only reason this is not a 5 star revisits that it’s annoying to wear and not have access to the time. Some type of display would be nice.,4
2274,"The band is pretty comfortable. The tone tracking does not work at all and support does not help. The couldn't get it working, but then it had been over 30 days so they wouldn't let me return it. The other features work well. The app is not very user friendly. There's no widgets or ability to connect it to other services, so I have to remember to go into the app to review my day. Overall, if you want a fitness tracker with no display, this will work for you, but I think other options would be better.",2
2275,"Sad to say it lasted for 11 months. I liked it til I didn’t. My Halo won’t charge at all. The green light still lights so I know it works, it won’t take a charge. Then I wasted more money buying a new charger and nada. I bought this in October of last year and wore it pretty much everyday. So this is one Amazon product I can not and will not standby. Guess I’ll be throwing money at Fitbit…UPDATE 5/22:Well Amazon had contacted me and sent me a replacement after reading my post. It was refurbished and worked up until a few weeks ago. And now my replacement crapped out as well. Soooooo, I’m done with Amazon Halo’s for good. And I was charged for the replacement also I see, so I paid for 2 and both are a waste of time and money. This is the first Amazon product I have and I must say it’s garbage. It’s now time to check out Fitbit…",1
2276,"I am happy so far. Much more comfortable for me over the iPhone and Fitbit I own. It is easier to sleep in for me too so get to use the sleep feature. I wish it had a display for time. The app is ok, could use a better interface, some of the programs you are doing don't come up first and can be a challenge to find. Also had it disconnect when I ran iOS update.",5
2277,I like the heartbeat feature.  And it downloads to the phone quickly.,4
2278,"The mobile app is great, the tracker doesn’t have a visual and I miss not knowing how many steps I have. I’m still getting used to the halo",4
2279,I have had this for almost a month. The sleep tracker is amazing. I wear it each night and it has made me more aware of my sleep habits. I was getting on average 3-4 hours sleep each night. Now I am trying to get 6-8 hours. Whenever I get at least 6 hours sleep I have more energy. I love my halo and i plan to do the body composition after Christmas. I will tell you how I like it later.,5
2280,"I only used it for the sleep tracking and steps. When my initial free membership expired it no longer tracks sleep, which seems like it should be a free feature.The tone analysis is weird and drains the battery but I couldn’t find a way to turn it off altogether so I left it at 1 hour.The charger is stupid. Would rather it used a universal port. Wish I could return it but I’ve had it too long.",2
2281,"The halo works great and is very accurate, my only complaint is the negative points for sitting.  Is there a way to turn that off?",4
2282,"I purchased a halo pre-release, and was able to get it set up properly. I then purchased a new phone... that’s where the problems began. Apparently, you cannot connect the band to a new phone once connected to a different phone (known issue by Amazon, no fix). The suggested fix was to create a new Amazon account and set up the band on a new account. That’s not really a fix, because it doesn’t carry over any information that was pre existing from the old phone/your current account. Fine, I created a new account, connected, and set up. Then, the flimsy clip to charge breaks, after a month of use (5-6 charges). No, I was not hard on it, no, I did not step on it. I simply attempted to open it one day, and it snapped. I contacted Amazon, to which they suggested I purchase a new clip. Which was currently unavailable. And wouldn’t be available for another month. I decided to return it, not because it didn’t work, but because it was significantly more hassle than it was worth. Save your money, time, and frustration and buy something (ANYTHING) else.",1
2283,"I liked the band, I retuned it because I did not think it would be worth the monthly subscription price to keep it. I would have rather paid a couple extra dollars and had the subscription included for life.",3
2284,I live everything about this device.  Super light weight and not bulky.  I had a smart watch but it was bulky and bothered me.  I can't even feel the halo! So comfortable.  App is packed full of great things! Exactly what I was looking for. Just wish it had a longer battery life.  But great device!,5
2285,"I love what the Halo does, the features but if you have tone enabled then it quickly drains the battery. Also I have a burn on my face from sleeping on my Halo one night and a mark of sorts in my wrist from the sensor.",3
2286,I really like the tone feature. It especially helps me be more mindful of how I speak to my kids. The app has a ton of great resources from workout videos to meditation.I do wish it had a simple digital watch face. It feels like a watch and I often find myself looking at it to check the time.  It’s just a bracelet.,5
2287,It would be nice to get move reminders or wakeup alarms by having Halo vibrate. Voice recognition takes way too much battery and while it's interesting I'm not sure it's worth it. I really like everything that's available in the app.,3
2288,"Love it.  Keeps me mindful of my steps and sleep.  App is easy to use and gives helpful notifications to keep moving, ways to stay active and overall health.  Tone recognition is interesting I think it picks up more than my tone, especially the music I listen too but it is interesting to see my tone after certain conversations. Charger is a little clunky to use but wouldn’t stop me from ordering another one.",5
2289,"Love the minimalist approach to the Halo, no overstimulation of notifications. Activity tracking goes beyond steps and incorporates the level of intensity challenging to you to change up your ruitine to achieve your goals. The body fat measurements help to visualize the future you without hyperfocus on weight. To round everything out, the labs suggest areas to work on, loving the sleep lab and details related to the quality and how to improve. Go Amazon, can't wait to see this product expand.",5
2290,"Product does everything as detailed and helps alot in everyday life! The app and the product does not enjoy being ""off grid"" app wants to access the internet it doesn't do much to help with phone battery. It's nice knowing how I'm doing with real numbers and seeing how what I do impacts my sleep or activity levels. I would like to see more features added as planned. The sleep tracking is very accurate besides the time it takes to fall asleep.",5
2291,"I wear the halo everyday and night and then it burnt my skin. I stopped wearing it two week ago, but the mark is still there.",2
2292,"I love the sleep tracker on the Halo, as well as the suggestions for improving sleep quality. Would like it better if it were also a watch.",4
2293,The mobile app works well but I don’t really like that it doesn’t have a display on the actual band.In addition the device gave me an itchy red rash on my wrist so I am unable to wear it anymore,3
2294,"Since the Halo is always on my arm, ALL of my steps throughout the day are counted. The various levels of sleep and overall sleep time is very helpful!",4
2295,The charger is terrible. I have to pay with it to charge my Halo. Also it does not always pick up my voice for the mood.,4
2296,"Super light I forget it's there, sleep is accurate. Voice reading was interesting, hubby agreed with the reading that I sound more annoyed during end of day discussions, I took some work shops in app to improve. The body image scan was a shot in the toosh I needed. Did it with bike shorts and form fitting tank top. Being able to wear in shower is what really made it my main tracker band.",5
2297,Good for someone who wants non distracting activity monitor. I find the screens on others to be distracting and also clunky with the large size.,4
2298,"I love my Halo, it offers so much more than another tracker I had and is a lot more accurate. It really keeps track of sleep/awake time, exercise movement, heart rate, etc.  It offers the body scan which really motivated me to move more.  I wish the battery would last longer as I need to charge it every 2.5 days but at least I receive an alert  to let me know its at 20%.",5
2299,I love this band. It's exactly what I've been wanting. It tracks my sleep and the steps I took and if they are important or not. It also lets my know how much sedentary time I've taken up since I tend to lay down or sit a lot. I love the BMI and Tone aspect of the device as well even though I used the tone part once. Overall I would buy this again if something happens to my current tracker.,5
2300,"This was a total waste of my money.  I waited too long to open and set up (due to personal issues and now I cannot return it!!!  Too bad, as it will either go right into my dresser drawer or into the garbage.  Too hard to set up - and they want a photo of yourself in minimal clothing.  Really??!!  They claim it will not be shared, but who wants a half-naked photo of themselves circulating somewhere in the cloud?  The sleep tracker is useless because the writing on the Iphone app is so small that you can't even make sense of what it tracks.  It means nothing.  And the band is so uncomfortable - I tied to wear the device for a day and it made a rash on my wrist.  Very scratchy.  You are better off spending more and buying a Smart Watch.  I WISH I COULD RETURN THIS PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
2301,"I have all amazon products in my home. I trust them. I have 3 alexas that honestly I love!! I was really excited about this product. This is the second Halo I've received and both of them tarnish on my wrist within the third day of wearing the the watch/unit. I returned the first one because of this and the replacement arrived nearly 60 days later and the same problem persists. I love the tracker. I expect more from Amazon products, and I dont wish to pay monthly for a cheap product. I'm sorry amazon, my feelings are hurt writing this review. I expected a Fitbit times 100 and regret this purchase x 2.",2
2302,"I love my halo. It’s not big and bulky like other devices. I forget I have it on. I charge it for 15 minutes while I shower and it’s never died on me. It has wonderful features that I enjoy. Yoga, meditation, core, and full body workouts. It has breathing techniques and my favorite is the sleep tracking. My sleep has improved greatly! It’s perfect for me!",5
2303,"Got woken up to a shock and burning sensation in my wrist, threw the watch off and haven’t worn it since. Still have a burn Mark",4
2304,"So I ended up buying this twice. The first time the sensor came off. They replaced it for free, but then said they never received the return, so not free. This is the second Halo device. The sensor is coming off again. It sucks because I love the app and all the features. Too much electronic waste. Such a shame. Very sad Amazon. Let me know if you figure out how to make these so they don't break.",2
2305,"I don’t like the Halo. It records steps and turns them into a point system, it deducts points for inactivity, so I have to use math to figure out how many steps I actually made. Big pain in the butt. The device is not waterproof so It is not recording my main form of exercise, water aerobics. I have add in  this activity, but it is not accurate. The body scan feature is not accurate. The sleep tracker  and heart rate monitor are the only features I find mostly accurate. I want to return this.",2
2306,Now here is a fitness band that lives up to the hype ! I love that the program is point based and not calorie counting or how many steps I take . Not only does it track all your work it has so many work outs to help you kick your heart rate up or help you fall asleep. I am so happy with this purchase and would suggest it to anyone I talk to .,5
2307,"Overall I love halo. My only gripe is how in accurate the sleep tracker is for me, however the app did a it is because  I may sleep on my arm. The step tracker is fantastic I've had no problems with it or the heart monitor which is helpful. The tone tracker is also a plus and not as intrusive  as I originally thought it would  be. The battery last about 2 days a charge.",5
2308,i love the sleep tracker but wish it would tell me more about how much deep sleep i should get and what the deep sleep means.,4
2309,I got this primarily to track my sleep and it’s very sketchy. I wear it the same way with the same tightness around my wrist. Sometimes it tracks and sometimes it doesn’t. Today it told me to double click the side button to download and I did it on and off the wrist. It also does not track naps. I take call for my job and really like to know my amount of sleep including naps. I wish I could get a refund.,2
2310,Sleep sync runs battery down. Requires daily recharge for that,4
2311,"I really liked all the tracking features. However, I have had to cease using it because it has caused a strange indentation on my wrist and the skin where the sensor made direct contact is discolored and the texture is odd. My lower arm and grip also feels much weaker that usual. I wore the Halo all day and night except when charging, and it never felt uncomfortable or too tight.I may use it to track my sleep once my wrist has gotten back to normal. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone without making them aware of this odd side affect.",2
2312,"It works nicely and it's very comfortable to wear. More comfy than my old Fitbit. I use to get heat rash real bad. The charger is a little funky, but works just fine. The tracker stays charged for a few days, that's including sleep tracking. The body fat scan is pretty neat. I just wish it was able to sync with other apps, but hopefully that will be happening down the road. Super informative! I'm really glad I bought it!",5
2313,The app is nice and covers allot. The voice analysis is different but interesting. You can always just shut that part off. Nice life tracker.,4
2314,"Whoop is too expensive, but it just cannot be beat yet.  Amazon keep at it, I will be back.",3
2315,I liked the halo when it was working. The first one broke within a few months. Randomly stopped working. Amazon sent me a replacement. Just shy of a year after purchasing it (of course accident warranty was one year) and it started to come apart on my wrist - the actual device not the band.,2
2316,Sleep tracker doesn't seem very accurate. Several times thought I was asleep when I wasn't and vice versa. Otherwise does what I expected.,4
2317,"This does so much it's actually a little scary! I am not a good sleeper and this is helping me monitor my sleep cycle. It was every easy to set up and as I don't consider myself too tech savvy as I am not as young as I once was, this again was a big plus . I would definitely recommend this.",5
2318,"Getting better quality sleep is important to me. I like how the band keeps tabs on my temperature, movements and wakefulness. The sleep score let's me know how I slept and gives hits on how to improve restfulness. Keeping track of mood and activities are also very helpful in keeping track of my over all mental and physical health.",5
2319,I thought I would like viewing results from the app but it would be nice to see it right on my wrist than having to open the app on my phone. Not much to it if you don't pay for extras monthly.,3
2320,"I really like the body imaging aspect of this product. For me I don't lose weight quickly: that's really discouraging, so by seeing that fat percentage shrink little by little really gives me the motivation I need to keep up my pace. I only wish they had something like an ankle band for those who can't wear watches while they work, but alas I have the same complaint about most fitness tracker.",5
2321,I like the functionality of the band and app. There's a lot of good content to help with your health and well-being on the app. I don't use the tone function much but when I do it's very interesting to see the results. Being able to quickly charge the band is a great feature as well. There are a lot of functions in the mobile app to allow you to make minor changes to your lifestyle.,5
2322,I love the sleep tracking feature and activity tracker/points. I'm not sure its worth the monthly membership fee though.,4
2323,"But the strap is thick,stiff, scratchy, and too uncomfortable to wear 24/7. Tech fails; human considerations fail.  I may have to return because if the strap discomfort.",3
2324,"The Halo Band is fine for what it is, with just a few quirks that I hope will be resolved in time.  I love the Halo membership -- there is a lot to choose from between recipes, various types of workouts, guided meditation options, and much more.One of the quirks is that the sleep tracker seems to change from time to time throughout the day.  For example, I might wake in the morning with only a ""Fair"" rating, but later in the day find the rating has been changed to ""Good"" or even higher.  Hmmm ...However, I purchased the Halo Band and received 6 months of membership with purchase.  A week later I found that Amazon had announced Halo View, and currently it's being offered for $20 less than what I paid for Halo Band, and it includes a full year of membership and has a better wristband.Very disappointed now.",1
2325,"App was great, low review due to battery life and no clock face.  Don't mind using the app for all the cool features, but I need to look at my wrist and see the time.",3
2326,"I love this device!  I have an Apple Watch but find it to be bulky and distracting.  I really wanted something to simply track my steps and sleep.  The voice feature is insightful too, but not the reason I purchased.  For the price, I think this is a great device!  I wish they were still available so I could purchase for my husband and daughter!",5
2327,We really wanted this to be a great product. When we first received it the battery would last at most 1.5 days. After about 2 weeks of this we received an email from Amazon saying they are sending a new one because the battery life was minimal. The new one came and the battery was great. The issue with this one is the sensor will not stay on the band. It keeps falling  out of the band and it is frustrating to say the least.  Last night was the last time. It is time to find another tracker as this did not live up to the hype,2
2328,I did order a second halo but if it only lasts for a short time this will be my last halo band.,3
2329,Fine as a basic fitness tracker but charging the device is like a carnival game trying to align for charging to take place. Very poor design where you have constantly fiddle and adjust to utilize a device intended for everyday use.,3
2330,I love this product. I feel it accurately tracks my steps and my movement. It does not allow me to lie to myself about my lack of movement either. Losing points is motivation enough to get up and move.I do miss my notifications from texts or phone calls but the other information is worth it!,5
2331,I like the idea of the Halo however with all the features constantly running I find myself charging the device almost daily.,4
2332,I love the halo! I was way too sedentary in 2020 and this is the exact motivation I need to get back in shape. My husband got this for me for Christmas and I love everything that it tracks. The labs and workouts are also really nice. It would be nice if Amazon would make login from different devices easy. It would be nice to do the labs and workouts from my iPad instead of my phone.,5
2333,"Pretty mediocre experience. Consistently records my pulse at half of what it is when I take it manually, watching the live screen in the halo app and comparing. This error is reflected in the heart rate graph. This makes the band useless for my main need of estimating caloric expenditure which is based on heart rate. Points for workouts don't vary smoothly. The app is exceedingly slow especially considering how little data is displayed. Very few historical comparisons can be made.It's great that there is no screen but in that case why is it so big and uncomfortable.",2
2334,Useful  easy to use easy to setup. Body scan Very helpful!  Looking forward to more linking to other apps. Sleep tracking and mood nice features.,4
2335,"It's light and easy to wear, but it's annoying to wear a ""large bracelet"" that doesn't tell you the date or time. We all have smart phones and are near computers that tell us the time, but I'm not normally near either and it's really annoying to wear this and a watch.  The battery life is also less than what I expected for something that doesn't have a screen.  It's not out right bad, but fails to compare to it's competitors.",2
2336,I would like for it to vibrate when I’ve been too sedentary and have other reminders and indicators for goals reached.,4
2337,I like that this provides many features but it is missing the watch and read messages options. Also for sleeping as this is now what it is being used for it is a bit bulky so I continue my search.,3
2338,I absolutely love my halo band! It’s does everything I need to do. And it really doesn’t bother me that it doesn’t have a screen I definitely enjoy all the features as well the halo app and all the extras! Wish I could buy another pink band and just the band hopefully in the future!,5
2339,"Saw this introduced about a month ago with an invitation price of $64.xx dollars. Could not get in on the ""IPO"" so purchased it for the $100 price on 12/18. It arrived at the end of the year - two weeks ago. One week ago I see a 25% price drop. Did not want to re-order and return my used one and thought Amazon would adjust the price. Well, the $74.xx price is now gone after 6 days or less and we are back to $100. Disappointed the price can fluctuate so mush on a brand new product. Lesson: Never buy something like this from Amazon in the first 30 days - WAIT. The jury is still out on the features, but since I have several months to return it - I'll wait for the next price drop and ""exchange"" it afterall. I did not feel right doing that to Amazon but since they feel okay yoyoing the price, I guess we're even. BTW this is the same yoyo pricing I've seen for two years with the blink XT2 cameras, Must be commonplace for Amazon to do this,",1
2340,"Follow up. Still an awful product not ready for use. Had to cancel my membership today after forgetting about this waste of money. My old FitBit is better than this design disaster.If I had written this review during the first 2 weeks after receipt, it would be 3 stars . However, the band just isn't worth the effort of repeated, and boring reboots. It is not accurate, and seems to stop working on a whim. Then, you must make sure you have a full charge, remove the device and reinstall. I've done that more than 3 times in the last 2 weeks. Today was the limit,  when I was unable to even reboot because I haven't received the OTP despite repeated requests (and now I have to wait until tomorrow because I made too many requests).Looks like this goes into the garbage heap.Follow up. Just got charged for membership for a device that is worse than useless  Inaccurate, uncomfortable and a woeful battery life IF YOU CAN GET GHE CHEESY CHARGER TO WORK.ALL CONS, No pros!",1
2341,The charging dock was difficult to use out of the box requiring you to squeeze it in order for it to charge. In 3 months one of the chargers of the 2 we bought was not charging at all. 6 months in the halo will no longer communicate with the phone at all. Even when everything was working it is a bit irritating to wear a watch without the time on it.,2
2342,"This fitness bracelet appearance is very subdued and comfortable.  I have only had it two days and I forget I am wearing it.  But set up was the Best.  Fifteen minutes and it is done.  I have NEVER had it so easy.  I am 73 years old and only moderately tech savvy.  Set up is usually an all day affair, sometimes successful, sometimes not!  I highly recommend this fitness bracelet.",5
2343,"The sleep tracking is terrible. Don’t bother with it, because any slight movement will cause the band shift and to lose vitals and only deliver partial (or no) results. Else you have to tighten the band and practically cut off circulation at the wrist.I did find the voice tracking informative, as I learned more about my tone of voice through the day. But it also radically reduced battery life, causing me to recharge it almost every day. It took a long time to recharge.Overall, skip this generation of product. Any decent sleep tracker on Apple Watch is far more reliable.",2
2344,So far I have been using this now for a mo th and do t find it accurate.  I am probably going to return as it is not as helpful or as informative as I thought it would be.,3
2345,How do I set my halo to know that I am wheelchair bound? I love having the thing I just cannot figure out how to fix that,4
2346,"I purchased the product at the end of November, 2020 and was very happy with the accuracy in which it measured my sleep, steps, heart rate, etc .  The device synced with my Weight Watchers ap to track my daily steps.Suddenly, without any misuse, the Halo stopped working, after a little over 70 days of having it.  It would not sync, it would not charge - it no longer was functional.  There was no technical solution from Amazon, but a refund was offered.  So, it is a mystery as to why the item failed to operate.  Very disappointed.",2
2347,"I wanted to like this because it’s the perfect band to be able to wear with other watches, however, it is too buggy and does not track properly. The band disconnects from the app multiple times for day, but you do not know when it stops. When it is connected, it does not accurately track calories or sleep (at least for me it doesn’t track my sleep at all). It is supposed to track your daily calories + exercise. It takes into consideration your BMR.So for example, my calculated BMR is about 1500 calories a day. I workout for about 1 1/2 hours, 5 days a week. This says I barely burn barely 1600 calories a day which includes exercise and BMR. For comparison, my Fitbit says I burn around 2300 calories for the same day.It is a pain to reconnect. It’s a pain to check the app multiple times a day to make sure it doesn’t disconnect. The activity tracker on the app isn’t consistent. I’m disappointed.",1
2348,"Battery life is 2-3 days, yet all of the other features are spectacular.  The App provides easy to understand data (sleep tracking/quality, activity, tone & calories.  An added plus is the Tone and Movement sections; especially when the App provides exercises / videos on how to improve.  After 3 weeks, the halo is motivational",5
2349,"Well, it looked nice on my wrist and it fit well.The sleep tracking wasn’t working for me, and I guess having a screen was more important to me than I thought it was.Tone was kinda cool, but not exactly what I was hoping for.For the price, it just wasn’t worth it to me, I’d rather spend a little more to have more accurate sleep, a screen, and a few more functions. Tone might be important to some, but not that important to me, especially with the way it worked.",2
2350,"I only had the Amazon Halo Band for a couple of weeks. I only took it off to shower and charge it. After that I placed it snugged two fingers up from my wrist bone. I have a watch that count steps and records workouts but no sleep monitor. I liked Halo's description.  The device was light and the app is informative. A few days ago, I went for a walk, check the band which I do out of habit, it was gone! The bracelet was still attached to my wrist but the device was gone. The device fell off the bracelet on a light walk! How is this not a defect? Searched everywhere for it. Called Amazon, the rep was a real a-hole about it. I've had health bands before, even cheaper ones, and never had the device fall off the bracelet. Now I'm out of a device and $80, left with the bracelet and charger as a reminder. Shame on you, Amazon!",1
2351,"I bought this for my husband, and he absolutely loves this! It has such cool features to help assist with overall health. A super cool feature is how it tracks your mood and speech infliction throughout the day. It always gives us a laugh when we review how the day went. I also like the body scan feature, it really puts things in perspective for your review. I highly recommend buying this, you won't be disappointed!",5
2352,The tone function seems to be accurate and I like the option to view it live or bookmark it for later. The scan seems to be on par with others. Overall pretty simple tracker that only tracks.After a few weeks I will add that I like the sleep tracking. I noticed on the days where I am dragging I can take a look at the app and see I was pretty restless the night before.,5
2353,I especially like the sleep tracking. I find it very accurate.,4
2354,"Loved this tracker for the first few weeks then it stopped working, won’t charge or turn on at all. Sad that it didn’t last long.",3
2355,"I have had a variety of problems with my Halo. I encourage potential buyers to visit the official FB Halo page. Steps are only tracked if you swing your arms, sleep is hit or miss, stairs are not tracked. HR tracking is helpful but I am not sure I would buy it again. I believe other trackers give better info. I do like the lightweight and size. I find the charge, without the voice tone feature lasts nearly a week. The voice tone feature is problematic in info it provides and it eats the battery life alive.",2
2356,"I think the concept and execution is great. I have a garmin vivo fit. I like it because there is a watch on it. The only reason I  wear things on my wrist is to jazz up the outfit and look at the time. I don't like having to wear my everyday watch too. Too much bulk on wrists. Also. I dislike having to constantly charge. Otherwise, this is a very informative and useful personal tool. But, I don't need to access my data that often.",2
2357,I did like it at first and it seem to hold a charge pretty well but one year and one month after date of purchase now it will not charge. There’s no way to buy a charger individually so now I have to buy a completely  new system again if I wanted to stay with halo. All they offered with a 15% discount to re-purchase.,2
2358,"The band that came with it is ugly.  I purchased an additional band which looks better but doesn't remain in place.  It was necessary to stop wearing the Halo because it caused a burn where it touches my skin.  I wore it for a month before noticing the red spot. I have not worn it for a week. It is now scabbing. I followed the directions (taking it off for an hour a day to allow the skin a rest).  I won't wear it again. However, I will continue to use the app for workouts and health tips.",2
2359,"The Halo was great for about 4 months. Then the Tone feature stopped working all together. I troubleshooted, reset my voice profile, and it still did not work. I didn't care that much so I continued to wear it. Then the sleep tracking started getting weird... saying I was awake for extended times throughout the night which I was now. Now, 5 months later, the battery will only last me about 12 hours. The Tone doesn't work so I know it's not because of that. It had been lasting 2, sometimes 3 days at first. And now only lasting from the morning charge, to dead at night. The same battery issue happened to my husband's also, and he gave up on it and got a different fitness tracker. I had high hopes for this, but it has definitely turned out to be disappointing. We both wish we could get our money back since it only lasted 5 months, but the return window has past. Would not recommend unless you only plan on using it for 5 months.",1
2360,"I wish there was a clock, but I do like the sleep and activity features. The app is great.",4
2361,My only negative remark is about how hyper aware I am of my heart rate these days. Haha love this product,4
2362,I've been using the Halo band for some months now and I love it. The body scan seems to be pretty accurate when comparing the results with a bodyfat scale and I love the fact that there is no display on this tracker.,5
2363,I love the suggestions for relaxation. It wonderful to have a small reminder everyday to take some time for myself to meditate and destress,4
2364,I like for sleep tracking and tone. Everyone tells me it’s my tone now I can work on this for myself.,4
2365,"I am a night shift worker. It did not track the days I slept, it counts it as inactivity. One of the reasons I bought it, so that part is useless to me.",3
2366,"the sleep tracking is informative and helpful, as well as the body fat analysis and activity tracker.  many informative articles and meditations.",4
2367,"Meh. I guess because it’s a first generation product, the Amazon Halo lacks a lot of simple features. An alarm, for example. It’s a long way off from a Whoop band or relevant Apple Watch features.",3
2368,Data is good. But I became sort of obsessed with the data; I spent too much time and energy trying to get the results I wanted. I'm not wearing the Halo band for awhile.,3
2369,I wanted something to track sleep and steps and I got that and much more!  Not 100% it's completely accurate on some of the body readings (i.e.I have had my body fat read and the result was fairly different) but it's good enough to track trends and that works just fine for me.,5
2370,"I really like this product!  I don't normally wear a watch so I don't care that I can't see the time or text messages on the screen of this tracker.  The best part, for me, is the voice recognition!  I talk to people all day (especially during remote work) and it's been very helpful to review my tone when dealing with customers or even my family!  :)",5
2371,I love this! I was one of the first people to try it! I was so excited about the sleep tracking! It helped me figure out how to get to sleep and be well rested. I also love the voice stuff. It made me really consider how I would be talking to friends and loved ones. It definitely put me in check with the tone I was taking with people! Great product!,5
2372,I mostly use my Halo for monitoring my heart rate during exercise. But I also like the way it monitors my sleep habits.,4
2373,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The product is amazing. And quite accurate. Nice sleek design however it doesn't really feel comfortable to wear. After a while it does kinda hurt. Everyone has different size wrists and so i don't know if the product it self is different for every size or the band is the only size difference offered. It is the first product made and I am honored to be one of the first to have. I know Amazon will improve its design in the future.",5
2374,"Amazon's entry into the wearable market is good,  not great.  By far the most comfortable to wear,  easy to swap bands and very accurate.  That being said it's entry level for those just starting out.  I used the Whoop and loved the recovery tracking side of things. Hoping Halo stays that soon.",5
2375,"At first I absolutely loved my Halo!  It did exactly what it claimed to do, was easy to use, and quickly and easily charged.  After two months of use the battery would no longer charge.  I reached out to customer service three times and received advice on remedies for every other problem except for the problem I was actually experiencing. The first time I asked for help I was told the Halo was free and therefore was no charge.  My second attempt I was sent a lengthy email telling me to do a full reboot (not possible as my halo is completely dead) and to unpair my halo from my phone and to reset it and pair it with my phone.  Since my Halo’s battery is 100% completely dead this is not possible. The third time I was disconnected multiple times from customer service without ever hearing from a customer service representative.I definitely do NOT recommend.  I’m frustrated and extremely disappointed with this device especially because I loved it when I first started using it.",1
2376,"I've been eyeing the android active watched for a long time, but couldn't justify the price. I work from home doing daycare so I just wanted the activity tracker and sleep tracker and this does exactly that. I love it. Super easy to charge and charges really fast. Battery lasts about 4 day, it is water proof,  but I still take it off to shower.  Definitely worth the money.",5
2377,"After first few days first disappointment- if I push baby stroller for 45 mins, walking around the yard I get only a few steps.",3
2378,I have have been trying the halo for past couple months now and just recently I started Weight Watchers and I'm really enjoying being able to sync my halo to my Weight Watchers app to help with my FIT points I enjoy using at least sleep tracker as well because it helps me track my sleep as well as I'm in the process of trying to lose weight,5
2379,"You can never charge the halo, the contraption doesnt even work to charge it. So now I have a halo I cant even use.",1
2380,"I used to have a fitbit and I loved it. That broke and I was selected to try this product I was hesitant. I've been using for about 4 months now and I love it. I feel that the voice recognition could be better. It thinks I'm mad based on tones of my voice even though I'm not. For example, when playing with my baby it thinks I'm mad.",5
2381,"I loved so many features of this device. Within 2.5 months, the battery reduced to unusable levels and then it wouldn’t reconnect to the app. Going back to Fitbit while Amazon improves its durability.",3
2382,"I received my Halo in December 2020.  It is a good product except for one thing. When I initially purchased the Halo, one full charge was lasting 5 to 6 days. I never use the tone feature. Last week, it started to lose it’s charge very quickly. One full charge is now only lasting 24 hours. It’s very disappointing. It’s very inconvenient to have to take it off for an hour and a half each day so that it can get a full charge. And of course, the return window closed on January 31, so now I’m stuck with it.",2
2383,I like that it's not distracting with another screen and I can hardly notice it. You can change the bands. Only problem was my first one was faulty but they sent me a new one and haven't had any problems since!,5
2384,"Purchased one for my husband and one for me.  It has allowed us to monitor our sleep patterns and be more intentional about the timing for sleep. After two weeks, we have a learned a lot about our sleep patterns, improved significantly, and feel rejuvenated. A small device that makes such a big difference.",5
2385,"It is nothing special, to be honest. I guess it's nice to see how active I am, but my phone can tell me that. I probably would not purchase again if I had to go back",3
2386,Ok I use the amazon halo for the sleep and The Full body scan witch is 100% on Weight and 100% on your body fat it’s amazing!! Now if ur using the amazon halo for tone the band will need to be charged every 2 days . If u don’t use the tone it will last 3 or 4 days maybe more to me the (amazon halo ) is better then fit bit!!,5
2387,"I've only been using this tracker for a week, but it gives me much more accurate info and a more detailed breakdown.Plus, giving targets to hit, it makes me more likely to exercise.Right now I'm not using any of the bells and whistles that come with it. I wanted to get the basics down first. So I'm not sure if I'll subscribe to the extras once the free trial is over.",5
2388,Has features other smart watches does not such as the tone tracker for voice and body image feature,4
2389,"I love what this product is trying to be. However it's faults are too many to justify keeping it. The most basic of features, the step counter, clocks me in for an order of magnitude more steps than I've taken, and sometimes, up to fifty times what I actually took. This level of inaccuracy alone has me highly suspect about any other features. Heart rate is accurate, at least. Vocal tone analysis is iffy, and has misunderstood a lot of what was said. Things others have laughed at has been interpreted as tired and calm. Battery lasts considerably shorter than it claims, in app, for the settings I have enabled. Trying to maximize battery life has the unit still only lasting a bit more than a day. Don't have a way to validate the sleep analysis feature, but I'm not confident based on other issues.",1
2390,"I love the look of the band and the way it feels on my wrist. I like the body scan and sleep tracking but the steps count is always off. I still use my fitbit to stay in challenges with friends and family I just keep it attached to my cloths vs. wearing it on my wrist since I've been wearing the Halo on my non dominate wrist. The Halo is usually at least 2-3k steps behind my fitbit tracker. I also know that I average 4-6k steps on a light day, the Halo is showing only 2k steps. I just don't feel like it's very accurate.",2
2391,"Like the app, the band gets very dirty very quickly.  I will definitely order on of the non fabric bands",4
2392,Was a bit difficult to reconnect after it disconnected. So I inevitably just deregistered/reset the band. Minor hiccup but works fine now.,4
2393,"After using it for about 2 weeks I developed a rash along the underside of my wrist. I stopped wearing the Halo completely, but it kept spreading in length and width around my entire wrist, so the doctor's guess is it's bacterial.  I've been treating it with compresses and Neosporin for 3 weeks, and it's better but not completely gone.I'd liked the app and the activity tracking features. I found the fat percentage and sleep trackers not super accurately, but still potentially helpful for trends. But, if I can't wear it, it doesn't matter how good it is.",2
2394,"I love it. Non-intrusive band that measures activity and more. I actually love the 3D imaging, it allows see what your body looks like in a useful feedback mode. I only wish it allows Apple health access so I can get a fuller picture in one spot. I highly recommend  for watch enthusiasts who want a tracker and not a watch.",5
2395,"Great device. My husband and I both got one at the same time. This device really gives you a good idea of how much ""down-time"" you have during the day, as well as tracks your workout intensity and steps. It also has a ton of other data to help you to make healthier choices. The negative points are always disappointing when they show up, but it helps push us to keep moving.",5
2396,I was very excited to try this new tracker. Looked very promising with features that other devices don’t offer - body scan and tone. The tone function  seemed pretty accurate but the speaker would randomly turn off.  The sleep tracker was awesome but it was so uncomfortable.  The fitness tracking gave me about 3k steps for wiping snow off my small car for 5 minutes. The device had some great possibilities but I couldn’t bear to wear it 24/7. No matter what I did it was uncomfortable.  Band is much too stiff and wide and readjusting didn’t help things.  Maybe next generation.,2
2397,"Unfortunately,  I am writing this review just as my Halo band stopped working and/or won't charge.  This happened early on to my spouses band, but it was within the warranty window.  Now I am here and have wasted $60 and my warranty period has closed.  I had high expectations from this Amazon product.  My recommendation is be cautious!  I will not be purchasing a new one.",2
2398,I actually loved this product until I took it off today to charge it. The back was gone...I wondered what that small rectangular metal piece was on the floor that I found 15 mins ago. Now I know! I am extremely disappointed that this happened. I’ve only had this Halo since November 24th....4 months to the day. Unfortunately I will NOT buy another one because I am concerned that this will happen again. I do not shower with this on and I always use a soft cloth to wipe down the device. I’m so annoyed by this!,2
2399,"I got this specifically for sleep tracing and body fat. Worked as expected, until I switched phones. I have no way not switch it over to a new phone without having to reset the device.",3
2400,I use the amazon halo mainly to track my sleep patterns. After getting familiar with the body scan and goal setting it has been my go to device for tracking daily activity and movement.The app is very user friendly and offers significant information regarding health tips on water and food consumption as well as the best workout techniques at your figure tips.I highly recommend purchasing this device.,5
2401,"It was nice at first, now you have to pay for things that were free when I first got it via a monthly subscription.  I was going to see about getting the new version but I think I'll go with a different brand.",2
2402,This band is so much better than anything I have tried (including Apple Watch) for monitoring my sleep. It knows exactly when I had deep sleep and what not. It is NEVER wrong. It helps me to make an effort to sleep better when I am running low on deep sleep and motivates to exercise. Amazon’s - Amazing - band!,5
2403,"The body comp is a pretty cool feature and hopefully other companies can follow suite. The app is intuitive and is easy to navigate. I am not a fan of the gamification of the app, it's cartoony and introduces points to aim for.If you're going to take advantage of the voice detection you will need to charge every couple days. The sleep detection didn't work for me as it didn't tell I was sleeping. This tracker would be great for someone who wants to track movement and steps. If you're looking for more impactful data I would stick to Whoop or Apple.",2
2404,I had high hopes for this device but the battery life is terrible it lasts shorter than Apple Watch even with no speech recognition being turned on I was getting only day and a half before the battery would die and for something that doesn’t have a screen that is terrible. The body scan feature is awesome everything else was kind of gimmick. Sleep tracker missed multiple times I woke up to get water and reported me in deep sleep during that time. The device has potential but I would wait for second or even third iteration. Returned it after a week of charging every day.,2
2405,"I use my halo everyday. Its the freaking best. I absolutely love it. Its sleek and comfortable so it doesn't get in the way of anything. My workouts sync to my WW app, which is a fantastic bonus. I love checking the app throughout the day or checking it in the morning to see how it tracked my sleep. I find it mostly very accurate. Would highly recommend. User friendly.",5
2406,I love that this can track my sleep somewhat accurately. It might just be me but I have not found another use for this other then checking my heart rate from time to time.,3
2407,"I was kind of skeptical about this product but decided to try it anyway - I've used it to monitor the number of steps I take during the day and the ""quality"" of my sleep - I have not tried the other features it has but intend to soon - it's easy to use - I've had no problems with app and so far it has a good battery charge life",5
2408,"Steps inaccurate, no way to calibrate for personal walking pattern. When synced in the morning, up to or more than 200 steps would be logged without stepping foot outside my bed.",3
2409,"I’m not sure what I am doing wrong but this device doesn’t synch regularly with my phone app. Maybe once a day, if I’m lucky, it will display my info. I only want to track my sleep and physical activity, but that hasn’t worked out (for me) so far. I’m not sure if it because of my phone or a bad connection or what. I have had the device for over 3 weeks and it hasn’t once displayed my information without a long delay and a lot of error messages.",1
2410,"I was very disappointed in the Halo. The band burned an imprint on my arm after about a month of wearing it. I was most interested in the voice recognition; however, it started rating my tone at times that I was not even speaking (like early in the morning while I was alone). I did not find the sleep tracking to be accurate either in comparison to other fitness bands. The app functionality and ease of use was great and I prefer it to that of the Apple Watch's app but not the band itself. I will stick with Apple.",2
2411,Very inaccurate on all levels would not recommend this product to anyone! Good thing I kept my Fitbit.,4
2412,I was excited to receive this item because it had sleep tracking.  It has tracked maybe 3 nights out of a month.  I would not suggest this band if you have an irregular heart beat.,3
2413,"After using the Halo for a couple of months, I'm not as thrilled as I thought I would be.  I've used a FitBit in the past and liked the fact that I could see my daily progress without looking at my phone.  The live Heart Rate is cool and pretty accurate.  I used the Tone function a little, but that sucked the battery down.  The body scan I have found to be inaccurate against an InBody scan.  It does link with my Weight Watchers account - but I'm just not sold on this product.",2
2414,"I wore the band almost daily for less than a year before it broke.  When I first got the band I was unable to get some of the features on the app to work even after multiple attempts.  When using the band, it would often not detect my sleep patterns and this was one of the main reasons I bought it.  It could be a decent product if some improvements were made.",2
2415,Fair function but pooor quality. My wrist is burned by the band. And the band is easy to get dirty and hard to clean. Function is fair compair to other brands I have.,3
2416,"This had potential. I enjoy the sleep tracker but I want to use it without the voice tracker. Since when I turn the voice thing off I can't track my sleep. Also wish it would just automatically record if I talk in my sleep if the voice thing is going to stay on. Anyway. I don't really trust the body scan. How can it actually tell how much fat I have based on a ""scan"". All the little extras on the app do nothing for me. This item still has a long way to go in my opinion.",2
2417,"I like this alot and am getting better at checking the app, just wish it would send a nudge on the actual product and not just to your phone. I didn't think I would need it to also have a visual clock but that would be a nice plus too. Other than that I am happy that I am learning more about my sleep, my tone of voice, and actual steps.",5
2418,"This has been used by my wife since late last year. Just last night, the plate that makes contact with your wrist fell off and the adhesive seemed rotted. Removed the bad adhesive and was able to get the plate back on but not sure how long that will last. Product support eligibility ended on June 12th according to my order page so I might look for something that can help this piece stay attached. Quite surprised it failed in under a year.",2
2419,"Love this thing, accurate and comfortable, having no display is wonderful and the battery lasts days.",5
2420,"I really wanted to like this band. I enjoyed it for awhile and liked how I had to open the app to see the data vs it being on my wrist with Apple Watch. However I realized I am definitely a person who needs the time on my band, I don’t like wearing two. I liked the tone feature too. I ultimately stopped wearing my halo because it wouldn’t stay paired to my phone and then I lost all my data with the body fats scans which is the only reason I wanted it.",2
2421,"I am loving the Halo. I like that I don't see my progress until I pull it up the app, I'm less distracted this way. I can pull it up any time I need yo see my progress throughout the day. The sleep tracker is awesome. Good to see the type of sleep I get each night. However, it doesn't count my sleep if I sleep less than 4 hours.",5
2422,Had this band side by side with my Fitbit. It tends to not measure sleep correctly (skips whole blocks of sleep). Voice measure drains the battery too quickly. And BMI measurements have a lot of variation. There is also 3000k avg difference in daily steps between Fitbit and Halo measurements (10k daily step average which is huge)On the positive side the body measurements of posture and flexibility were great. Nice integration with corrective exercises.Band still needs more work on its accuracy,2
2423,It is amazingly accurate reporting tone of conversations.  The words they use to describe the tone are very telling but not harsh.,4
2424,I love it!! It is comfortable to wear even to bed so I can see how I was sleeping. Since I had the Halo my sleep had improved and with the mobile app I am see how many steps  I have and push myself further. Also with the no fuss style I am not distracted by a screen to look at. The accuracy is spot on. And the price is very affordable.,5
2425,"The charging interface for this fitness tracker is really terrible. It has to be set in the cradle just right and in my experience the device often dies because I cannot get it mounted properly in the charging cradle. If that was fixed, I'd give this device a 5/5 for the really great sleep + body fat tracking.  But as it currently stands, I would not recommend this device to anyone.",2
2426,I I'm currently on Weight Watchers the Halo is compatible with the Weight Watchers app and if your ankle is small enough the band we'll sit around your ankle without buying and different band,5
2427,"I was hoping for so much more. The worst part is how uncomfortable it is. It's quite wide, and the side that sits on your wrist extends past the wrist skin surface, only the center of the unit,about an inch  or so is against skin, and the center back, (black plastic), is totally flat, not slightly curved like ""traditional"" activity trackers.  It needs to be snug to read anything, but this causes it to stick to the skin.  It gives me blisters, which pop and peel very quickly.  I waited until it healed, tried again, same thing.  I did take it off occasionally as directed.  I cannot use it, cannot find how to cancel the subscription on Amazon's website so I don't get charged more in 6 months.  I wish I could still return it.A minor thing is the pink band looks dirty very quickly, but following the directions given to clean the band works well.",1
2428,Loved the product. Cancelled service for a few months and tried for half a day to activate with a new phone. Customer service couldn’t help. This kind of experience gives Amazon a bad reputation and makes this loyal customer want to quit buying Amazon products.,5
2429,I really like the fact that it does not tell time. The down fall is that it does not hold a charge for very long. I literally have to charge it every single day.,3
2430,"I am disappointed in this tracker. The battery life (1 day) is horrible if you leave tone of voice on. The sleep tracker didn't ""score"" my sleep for the first couple days, and activity isn't particularly accurate either. They recommend you take it off to charge when you're showering, brushing your teeth, sitting at your desk, or other low-activity times. That's fine to suggest, but that means I have to think about this device more than I should. It's an overall disappointing Amazon product. I rated it two stars only for appearance and ease of use. otherwise it's not a particularly helpful device",2
2431,"It won't pair with my new phoneI went from an IPhone to a samsung galaxy S21 Ultra , and it will not pair with my new phone",3
2432,"The concept of the Halo is great, if only it actually worked.  It was awesome when I first received it; however, it quickly became a hassle.  When I would try to open the Halo app to check my stats, it frequently said that the band wasn't connected and I needed to double tap the button on the Halo to sync it with the app.  That never worked.  Not once.  Not ever.  I had to uninstall the app, deregister the device, remove it from bluetooth, every. single. time.  It was so frustrating!  Each time it took several tries of doing it over and over again until it would finally sync, only to have it do the same thing the very next day.  It was a complete waste of money and now I can't return it because I've had it too long and threw away the box it came in.  Buyer beware.  I can't recommend this product at all.",1
2433,"I really appreciate the sleep tracking, and the breakdown I can give me on REM, light sleep and deep sleep. I also really appreciate the supporting programs that can add stories or meditation or music to help me fall asleep and stay asleep.The body profiling and exercise seem good.",5
2434,"I was excited about this tracker but overall disappointed. Sleep tracking seems to be pretty accurate but it's unbearable to wear all day and even worse for the night. The body imagining doesn't seem to be accurate based on weight, height, and measurements I'm getting two different numbers for BMI. My favorite part is the way this tracks your steps, I love seeing the intensity of my movement throughout the day. I didn't think I would mind not seeing info on the band itself but it is not ideal for checking your heart rate during exercise.",2
2435,I have had this item for an extended period. I am not impressed. Battery life is adequate as long as you keep it basic. The second I turned on the Tone function the battery life was terrible. I like many that are rating this product was an early adopter. I should have returned it like many of my friends but forgot the timing. The item now sits in a drawer sitting attached to the impossible charger. I know the hope was to emulate the competition but it does not come close. Maybe phase two will be a better unit.,2
2436,"I wear my Halo constantly to track my steps, monitor my sleep, and participate in the exercise programs. I used the voice recognition for a while but it increases battery use and I really wasn't getting that big a benefit from using it. The Halo comes with a charger and a charge usually lasts 2 days for me. I like the product.",5
2437,I can not answer most of the questions as I had difficulty getting it to connect up to my phone...I'm going to ask my grandson to help me...it is probably due to something I'm doing.,3
2438,"I like the app and also the band, the only issue is have to charge every 2 days.",3
2439,Need to add ability to search workouts rather than one endless scroll,3
2440,"I especially like the sleep tracking info. Also, it is slim and attractive compared to my previous fitness tracker.",4
2441,I am loving this halo!!  My science nerd brain is going nuts. Great feedback with sleep portion of app. I now have something concrete to show my sleep specialist. Would love to see it integrated into other health & fitness apps. The voice portion of the app is interesting way to reflect your tone to others. Have only worn a week am I am all in!!,5
2442,"Great for my lifestyle.  It does not require the intense monitoring of an Apple Watch.  The mobile app works on only one device at a time.  I am forced to sign out of the app on one device to see the information from the app on another device.  Work on it Amazon...Also…as you can see from the attached photo, the back continues to fall off my Halo.I am currently working on Halo number three (3)..When will you redesign to avoid this?I do NOT shower in the device for this reason..Solutions?",2
2443,"I love the simplicity of this device!  On its face, a “fitness tracker,” but so much more, offering access to workouts and programs from yoga to meditation to aerobics, nutrition, sleep and more.  I am especially pleased that I can wear this device with no obtrusive beeps or “reminders,” checking in through the app when I choose.  Well done, Amazon, and thank you!",5
2444,It workee okay while it lasted. Step and activity tracker was inaccurate at times. Voice recognition was useless and sleep tracker was interesting.  However the device came apart ( see pic ) after 6 months of light use. Return and product support window is closed and apparently there is no warranty.,5
2445,"I also have the Biostrap and wore them at the same time. Halo doesn’t have as many features, but has all the important ones, plus the body composition tracking is great. Battery life is 3x better with Halo and it auto-detects exercise, which makes it easier to use. For the price, batter life, and ease of use - Halo wins hands-down.",5
2446,"Yes i still use both Iwatch and Halo with Peloton or outdoor run, but after few experiments only Halo to track my sleep. It do more accurate job here for sure and this band is perfect to wear with fancy watches on the other armStrongly recommend!AND on the top of that battery holds about 6 days 24 hours with trainings, but without the tone listening (don't like this idea)",5
2447,The verification code doesn’t send so I can’t even set it up to begin with. When I resend the code it locks me out of the app for an hour. Typical garbage Amazon product.,1
2448,It was great for four months. But the charger is a pain in the butt. And now the app is just useless. It continuously crashes. It won’t sync without me restarting the band manually. And now I can’t even get that far because the app has become useless.I’m glad I was part of the beta phase because I’m not going to pay for the membership. I’m looking at ordering a new fitness tracker because this one has been s as huge disappointment. I’d return it if I could.,2
2449,"Comfortable , non distracting , good sleep data and step data , and wish it integrated with more apps besides that solid device",4
2450,"Enjoyed the Halo band for the year that it worked. I especially liked tracking my sleep and workouts, but for it to not be able to charge a year after buying is no bueno.Update: Great customer service! Got a replacement and couldn't be happier.",5
2451,"At first really was excited about this as I wear a Fitbit but I'm always looking to better my self-care journey, and the fact that you could upload pictures and it would analyze things I don't exactly remember now what it did because it's been so long since I've worn it it absolutely does not link to my phone or Alexa but  I'm still being charged a monthly fee for the Halo. ????? And multiple times I've tried to cancel my halo subscription and it's always "" something went wrong please try again.""",1
2452,"When my halo was having difficulty charging, the customer service people were very helpful.  I don't use all of the app because there is overlap with my WW app. If I didn't have both apps, I would explore more.",5
2453,"I was excited to use this after seeing the body composition feature. Sadly, that feature was was inaccurate and overall not worth using imo. I really liked the sleep tracker, it wasn't uncomfortable to wear while I was sleeping like I found with other trackers to be. The activity tracker totals points daily for you to reach an end goal. I didn't find that to be as motivating to stay active like a daily tracker that are normally utilized. Didn't try the tone feature.After 6 weeks it stopped syncing with my phone.You're better off buying a Fitbit.",2
2454,"I like the app, I like the style, I like the fit.  Like many many many others have said, my battery now drains in less then a day and when I put it on the charger, the light no longer turns on to indicate it's charging.  I have to look at the app to see that is in fact charging.  I've had it for a few months and if it worked i'd be happy to recommend but countless people have had the batter/charger stop working so this version is clearly not something I would recommend to buy.",2
2455,Good battery life if one is not using tone analysis functionality. I like sleep tracker and body fat scan functionality,4
2456,"I have no idea if they've fixed this in a revision or not, but the main reason I ordered one was to track my sleeping, and two days after getting it the Halo stopped tracking my sleep.  Rebooting it, updating, checking everything I could think of didn't fix it, so I returned it.It has potential, but like too many amazon products lately, seems like they rushed it out to try and hit the market as fast as they could without double checking to make sure it did everything they said it would do.  Disappointing.",2
2457,"I so wish this could be a 5 star review. The tone functionality is FANTASTIC! However, There is no way to turn off the pre-set 8/hr max inactivity/sitting function. So no matter your school, work or other requirements of daily schedule -this service PUNISHES the user with point deductions for doing their required life activities.I will not be renewing the monthly plan for only this reason. It is a shame too, because I really really liked this item, but do not encourage anyone to pay for an item that punishes for doing real life studying and learning to better yourself.",2
2458,"Mostly monitoring sleep, and pulse tracking.",4
2459,I love my halo. It does everything i want it to. Something to bear in mind however its still early and they are always updating stuff on this. This tracker is not for hard core fitness people. If you use other ones you may not be happy with this band yet. For everyone else please dont listen to the bad reviews comparing this tracker to others. This is an excellent tracker.,5
2460,"It does not really do much, when it gets more features I think it should be good.  It also does not sync with any scales or any other third party apps.",3
2461,"I compared the sleep feature, which was the main reason I wanted this to , which I didn't think I was chosen for so I got a fitbit. There where times when I was awake tossing and turning and it would say that I was asleep.  The pedometer I compared with the one on my watch and the fitbit and it would be 2000 - 3000 steps less in a day, the other 2 were within 100 - 200 different from each other. I don't want to pay for a monthly service for something that is not accurate.",2
2462,"This is the most cumbersome and uncomfortable thing I’ve ever worn on my wrist. It actually hurts. Other than than that, the features are great and the voice tracking is eye opening.",3
2463,I was obsessed when it arrived.  3 days later it stopped syncing or charging. Super disappointed as I have great data that will now be lost!,2
2464,"The sleep tracking worked for a little bit for me. I definitely wore it while sleeping and during a nap and it never registered parts of my nap or parts of my night of sleep. The mobile app left a lot to be desired it’s very simple. Voice recognition seem to work pretty well, it seems to just pick up on keywords that you say rather than a specific tone. I found the band to be uncomfortable. There is no charging block included with the item. The charging device is odd. I put the device into charge and unless I put it in wrong which I probably did, it did not charge. I had the item for about 24 hours before I took it off. I understand the simplicity part of it but there are no ways to set up any kind of alerts or silent alarms. I don’t mind not having a display but to at least have the capability of a vibration silent alarm would be wonderful.",1
2465,There were nights I know I actually woke up and it did not register it as a disturbance.,4
2466,"I love everything about my Halo, except when I put it on the charger, the glass shattered! I didn't get the extended warranty. Oh, well.",3
2467,The cloth band is an odd option. Gets dirty quickly though you can wash it. I found the sleep tracking a bit finicky. If I was reading in bed it tracked it as sleep. The voice recognition was not good at all.  Wore down the battery quickly too. Picked up on coworkers and even tv as my voice. The movement was pretty accurate though. Comparable to my Apple Watch. The app is clean and easy to use. I missed a watch face and didn’t want to wear two bands on my arm(s).,2
2468,"Not very accurate. Band itself is ITCHY. Tracking isn’t very accurate at all, especially sleep. Tone monitoring has analysis when I don’t even say anything, and if the app doesn’t tell me what I said, how can I know WHAT things made me sound annoyed, stubborn, etc. And sometimes I am talking nonstop and get no readings? Just not worth the money at this point. Body composition tracking is cool, but you don’t even need the band for that, just the subscription.",2
2469,I love this purchase soooo much. Being able to track different components of my overall health has allowed me to drastically reduce my stress and anxiety. Highly recommend,5
2470,I like the concept of the haloUnfortunately it’s a little more bulky than you would expect for what it isTends to get caught on a lot of things as thick if not thicker than your average watchTrying to compete with the Apple Watch at a lower price point I’m assuming but having to pay for a subscription seems like a waste of moneyUnfortunately about three month in the app started getting really flaky and barely ever syncsWill probably stop wearing it due to be more trouble than it’s worth,2
2471,"Didn’t use this long enough to really provide a great review. I will say, the need for constant sharing without an easy charging solution made me want to keep with my Apple Watch.",3
2472,Great for non-distracting fitness tracking.  Not so much into voice listening and body shape measurements.  Halo is a good first gen product but I would hold off until the next gen version gets it right.,3
2473,I love how the app scans your body and it’s a really accurate model. The tracking is surprisingly good as well. I ordered the medium band Halo but I’ll be reviewing the large band. I also like that the band snaps off for easy cleaning.,5
2474,"I am so disappointed with the amazon halo. I absolutely loved using it- such an easy way to track your progress with your fitness journey.It somehow unsynced from my phone and I followed the instructors online to resync it to my iPhone. In doing so, it erased ALL of my data and progress from the past two months. The instructions online did not say this step would completely reset my watch and now I’ve lost all my progress. It is so disappointing.Go buy the Apple Watch because I doubt this happens.",2
2475,I wish the app had more options for adding activities like other fitness apps. Not very sure about the accuracy,4
2476,"I like wearing mechanical, analog watches but felt weird wearing two things with a clock. Halo is a great option to get accurate health data without having to give up my nice watches; I pretty much forget that I'm wearing it. The accessory bands are great and easy to swap out; I'm using both the fabric during the day and when sleeping and the sports bands for my workouts.",5
2477,I like the idea in theory.  Unfortunately the body scanning is a little off and the sleep tracking is WAY off.,3
2478,"Product was great, app was great. Sleep tracking and heart rate monitoring. Loved everything about it.~~However~~ at least once every two days the APP and or device would ""forget"" its pairing. Okay no big deal. BUT HEY GUESS WHAT, you have to go through the WHOLE setup all over again. OKAY not a big deal, aggravating. . . . but no big deal . . . . BUT WAIT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE CHARGER TO DO IT and its a unique to the product charger. . . SO Forget it. Learn to code amazon or whoever developed this junk.",1
2479,Sleek and comfy. I love all the info it gives me about the quality of my sleep.,5
2480,"Started using halo in Feb. Never had an issue now suddenly it won't charge.  Tried different chargers, different outlets, wiped down the sensors on both products...still nothing . Very disappointed. Love my halo band.",5
2481,I like the avatar body scan. I like the sleep tracking and the labs that help you achieve better sleeping habits. I like the voice tone monitor. It has made me conscious of how I sound to others. As a result I have begun making changes.I don’t like how it monitors activity. I think I have been more active than what is monitored.,5
2482,I always felt it. It was too much. It was not comfortable  to me.,3
2483,"It feels very bulky and clunky on my arm. Also, I developed some skin irritation after wearing it for only a few days. I don’t like it as much as I want to.",3
2484,Track each activity perfectly,4
2485,"Don’t waste your money.Body scan is inaccurate- by about 10% consistently. Was scanned by my doctor literally four hours prior to the one the Halo did.Voice tone is cool, but....that’s about it. Nothing new or exciting. You think I don’t know I’m frustrated? I’m frustrated- I don’t need a bracelet to tell me. Also, if you have it on full time it will drain your battery in the middle of the day.Sleep tracker. I work very weird hours and I sleep at very inconsistent times. The bracelet literally will not count my 3 hours sleep during the day because it’s during the day & not very long. Then sometimes I’ll sleep 7 hours and it will say I was in bed for 10 hours. It’s insanely inaccurate.The charger? Don’t even get me started. It will not connect without messing with it for about 15 minutes.It’s not worth anyone’s time or money. Is it cute? Yes. Is it stylish? Yep. But...that’s it. Also, then replacement bands are so expensive!",1
2486,"Not only does amazon have the unmitigated gall to create a device that does less than an existing smartwatch, while simultaneously feeling it warrants a monthly fee for what those superior smartwatches do by simply owning them, they can't even figure out how to make the thing work even half as reliably as said superior devices. I foolishly took a chance on one of these, thinking, hey, it's amazon, it's gotta be better somehow, right. Well, wrong. Not only is the feature set sorely lacking against my Samsung smartwatch, AND a little $30 one I found on wish, it can't even reliably perform it's limited functions. So why, would I pay amazon every month for something that doesn't even work as well as a $30 smartwatch from wish. I honestly can't find a valid reason why, as after two weeks of owning a halo, it still refuses to perform even the most basic tasks, or even stay on despite being fully charged. It's an overpriced, horribly uncomfortable fashion bracelet that's sole function is showing off my foolishly poor taste.",1
2487,I love the sleep tracking the mobile app is good but I have to refresh multiple times for it to synch. The charger is a bit of a pain to line up right but nothing too crazy. The voice analyst doesn't reflect how i talked accurately enoght to justify the battery hit. The body fat portion is really cool and the main reason why I bought this app.,5
2488,"Need to be able to turn off or change the sedentary scoring. The scoring is too harsh and demotivating. It also doesn't handle biphasic sleep well, even after the last update.",3
2489,"I loved the sleep tracking in particular because my Samsung didn't do a particularly great job at it. This device broke things down to REM sleep.  It started off awesome & then began not recording certain days. Now, it won't charge. Received it mid September & it's dead. It was a good idea, but fizzled pretty quick. Save your money.  They sent me another one and this one tells tells me that I'm sleeping 2 or 3 hours a night instead of the 7 or 8 hours of sleep that I'mactually sleeping. I have a camera in my room just because I wanted to track the difference between my Halo device and what I'm actually doing during sleep. My camera is accurate and this device is not. For this 2nd Halo I have been on the phone with support twice and they have tried to troubleshoot it twice and it is still not working, with no new one being sent. A great idea but save your money it does not work for long.",1
2490,Had it since December 2020 and today it no longer charges. Since it’s now useless not much else I can say. Worked great before...,3
2491,"Sexy, fun, exciting, interesting....but doesn't last six months!The back fell off, sleep tracker became inaccurate over time, and would not hold a charge for 24 hours.I've read many negative reviews, but didn't think a problem would happen to me. It's been a love-hate relationship with this product. I'm out the money as it's past the return period. Amazon has a long way to go to meet the standards expected in a fitness tracker. We early buyers essentially paid to be their test market guinea pigs!",2
2492,Hello. I love the band but I just got 2 weeks ago and the charger is now not working. Thank you.,4
2493,"The main reason I bought this was for the tone option. After a week of using the tone, it had taught me how I sound to others and how I should change the tone. The option to do a live tone is a great feature.For the sleep feature it is more in depth on the sleep tracking by showing how many disturbances happen.",5
2494,"It’s useless if you’re outside the US. The app is not available and no workarounds to install it nor to use the device without it are available. So, another useless gadget I guess.",1
2495,"I really like the simplicity of the tracker. I love not being distracted by a screen. Being able to go through my day not being bothered by notifications is great. Steps appear to be accurate along with the sleep tracking. I only wish it went more in depth beyond steps, sleep, and heart rate. With just those 3 metrics it makes it tough to justify the monthly fee.",5
2496,"It worked as expected in the past nine months. Because I sweat during exercise, the cover on the back peels off and I didn't feel comfortable when wearing the device since then. The customer support team contacted me and they resent a new one to me.",5
2497,"I think this product is great!  I love all the options such as the sleep tracking, the body scan, tone tracing and activity tracker. I am using them all. I also love the ease of using the mobile app to view my progress. In addition, the app has a battery indicator that gives me a heads up when my Halo needs a charge.",5
2498,"It was usually wrong in measuring my sleep, saying I slept for 2 to 3 hours, when actually it was 6 to 7.  The pink band is difficult to keep clean.",1
2499,"I liked the concept of using an app to read from the device and display data that is easy to digest. Activity score is a good motivator. My main and major concern is that data shown for heart rate in the ""live"" tab is not accurate. When I  go on a hike, as elevation increases, the device shows low heart rate ( 39bpm, 52 bpm) but at that time, I was sweating and I could feel my heart beat at a faster rate. Heart rate accuracy is critical for my cardio exercise and it need to get fixed.",2
2500,Sleep tracking stopped working about six weeks after first use.  Reported problem through Halo app and received email from tech support with instructions to first reboot and if that didn't fix it perform a reset.  Neither option resolved the issue.  The email said to contact them by chat to let them know if it didn't work and they would send a replacement.  I contacted support through chat with all the information and was told I'd have to talk to them via phone.  Device isn't reliable and tech support is difficult.,2
2501,"I am an active WHOOP user of over 2 years and was selected to try halo by Amazon.Even with WHOOP at $30 a month you really do get what you pay for. Whoop is way more accurate, has a better battery and charging system, measures respiratory rate and calculates my recovery process.Now halo is $3 a month which is much much cheaper however the data I get is very limited and inaccurate at that. That band is a little more comfortable on the halo.I feel like the hardware is solid on the halo and almost all of the issues can be fixed on the software end.The labs are not organized well at all. I should not have to search through all the labs to find the one I started yesterday.Halo has a lot of potential however at this time it is a swing and a miss.If you are serious about health, performance and pushing yourself to the next step m, spend the extra money get a whoop and make it happen.",1
2502,There's almost no redeeming qualities to this thing. The app fails to sync to the device half the time. The battery life is poor (3 days at most). The body scan is way out of range for me. It fails to track sleep way too often. The app is full of bloat junk that just makes it slow and hard to find the useful things.The band is much more comfortable than previous fitbits I have used.,2
2503,"I love this Halo, it’s sleek & comfortable, I don’t really know it’s on. I love checking the app to see progress I am making. Who would have thought I could do 9,000 steps just moving around my house. I also have Sleep Apnea & it’s amazing the info it records(even how many times I get up to pee)lol. Would highly recommend!!!!",5
2504,Great no fuss wearing and the labs were you try workouts and routines are robust and enticing. It doesn’t integrate with ANY other major fitness tracking app like Apple Health or MyFitness Pal. The app should show things like calories burned on the main dashboard instead this info is buried under confusing menus.  No food or nutrition tracking. You can’t track what kind of workout you’re doing to associate your activity and exertion levels with a particular activity. Also the heart rate tracker is so woefully inaccurate the tracker is effectively useless. *sigh* The search continues.,2
2505,"Really wanted it for sleep and activity tracking. Seems decent for that. Nothing spectacular, but overall fine. The only thing that concerns me is that after only 3 months the battery loses its charge much fast than it did the first month - noticeably faster. I never use the voice “tone” feature which sucks up battery really quickly either. Oh well.",5
2506,I liked the majority of features this band offered.  The charger though is a fight from the very first attempt to charge until the charger failed less than a year after the purchase.,2
2507,The halo hurts my hand when I wear it. Doesn’t matter which arm I wear it on my hand will hurt. I which I could wear it because it tracks so much.,3
2508,The sleep app is not accurate. I get up to pee and when I go back to sleep it does not track. I will go back to my Apple Watch if you get up to go the bathroom and fully wake up it does not record the total time asleep. Not good as you are getting an inaccurate reading,5
2509,"I bought it to help track my sleep better, but it was so uncomfortable to wear that I found myself opting not even to wear it while sleeping",3
2510,"I like the approach of combining many different use cases in one app, emotional (voice), sleep, exercise videos, heart rate tracking, and physical activity monitoring.None of the features are perfect, but I was willing to give them time to improve, until I found that there is no way to display workout videos on my TV or monitor.Screen mirroring apps do not work and there is no website that I can use on my desktop.They've cripple the user experience by locking down the content, I plan on returning the device.",2
2511,What I love about this product is everything. The BMI is a good way to start getting fit and staying fit. I have problems sleeping and this is giving me a good picture of my activity daily and sleep. I enjoy the Labs that you can learn a lot and work out with. I have been slowly getting into a routine with the app.,5
2512,"I absolutely love my Amazon Halo. It is the best fitness/wellness tracker EVER. It tracks your sleep, activity, voice tone, and even body composition. The halo gives you access to help you improve healthy habits to allow you to be as successful as possible to meet your weight loss/health goals. One of the best investments I have ever made for my health.",5
2513,I love the breakdown of level of exercise and the sleep tracker.  It provides a great breakdown of information!,4
2514,I don’t normally ever write reviews but I felt this one is necessary to protect the consumer...DO NOT BUY!I have owned the Amazon halo fitness tracker for about four months. It worked great for the first three and then the battery will not hold a charge.I brought this to Amazon customer services attention and not only did they say I have to pay $14 to return the device myself they did not offer an exchange for the item.Seems like poor customer service especially when they are praying that people will pay five dollars a month for their halo fitness tracker subscription.Please do not buy this device because it is not worth it there are plenty of other fitness trackers that are just as good and have much much better customer service that actually want to keep the customers.I will be contacting the BBB and other fraud companies because this falls under the definition of fraud selling a defective item and charging you to return it.,1
2515,"I was looking forward to trying the Amazon Halo. When I received it, it took 30 minutes to place the band properly in the charger to get it working. I was impressed with how long the band stayed charged, particularly when compared to other bands. I attempted to charge it again and nothing that I did worked. I contacted Amazon Support and they said that the only option was to return it. They would not send out a new charger or exchange the band. Now the price has increased. Amazon has lost a Halo customer as a result.",2
2516,So happy to say I love my Halo!!  The sleep tracker is great as well as other features!  I REALLY like the battery life too!  I tried the voice analyzer but that really took away battery life so I probably won't utilize that function much.  It is super comfortable as well which is a super perk!  Great Job Amazon!!!,5
2517,This is such a great product! Measures my sleep and tells me how many interruptions I had during my sleep. Use it with my mobile phone. Also keeps track of my activities. Need to take pictures to see the body mass index. Gave the same product to my daughter for Christmas. We both love it!!  It also tracks activity for me.,5
2518,This thing is inaccurate and doesn’t work as suggested. I want to return it because it doesn’t synchronize or have accurate readings.,3
2519,This fitness watch is good and is constantly improving and getting better. I like the fact that it has health labs that give you opportunities to improve on your overall health goals. The mobile app is constantly adding new challenges and let you know new things that are being added. You get the opportunity to grow and learn with this fitness app.,5
2520,"The battery life is terrible, only lasts about a 36 hours. And the sleep tracking is way off. One night I tossed and turned all night, was up  and out of bed 4 different time and it said I slept great gave me an 82 rating.  I would not recommend this. I am going back to my Fitbit for tracking.  The only good thing is the band is easy to sync and the app is easy to use. Too bad its inaccurate. Amazon I think it's back to the drawing board with this one.",2
2521,Good product but functionality a year later is reduced.,3
2522,"are you looking for a product that is the ugliest thing on the market? doesn't have basic features like analog clock? maybe something that malfunctions every other month? Maybe you want to spend months building progress you can track and look back on, only to be locked out of your account to never access it again? Maybe you enjoy general frustration when getting in touch with customer service who have told you to factory reset it every time you reach out? I ALREADY TRIED THAT STEVE 75 TIMES IF IT COMES OUT OF THE FACTORY AS GARBAGE RESETTING IT TO GARBAGE IS STILL GARBAGE STEVE. Friendly advice, save your money, get a Fitbit, an Apple Watch, a god damn pedometer from 1992, all will be a better spend then this hunk of garbage right here.",1
2523,The sleep tracking is quite amazing. Im using it for information to give my doctor.,4
2524,"I purchased this un June, im not rough with it at all I mostly use it as a sleep tracker. I actually love its accuracy and the way it integrates all areas. Its actually super helpful. I never put it in water so i dont know why it eroded but today after pulling it off the charger the back glass just fell off. It's held on by a black glue and I can't get it back on. So I can either wear it with the chip inside pressing against my arm or... not. I'm not sure but they say on here returns or replacements are only for 30 days but if this product only lasts 5 months. It's not worth it to me. Even though I've loved it so far I can't really use it anymore after only 6 months of normal use",1
2525,"Love this product! Great activity tracker.  The lack of screen makes it less distracting at work (even if I do occasionally try to check for the time).  Body fat analysis portion is nice for an alternative way to track weight loss.  The tone analysis drains the battery fast, so I typically don't use the feature.  Band is comfortable and easy to wear!",5
2526,"I need to charge around 1-2 days. I thought that is not convenient for me. This one just track the steps, sleeping but I need to charge almost every day",3
2527,"Sleep tracking is amazing, the only thing I would improve is the app. It’s easy to use, but sometimes it’s hard to find a specific item due to the depth it is hidden. Other than that, so worth it because you don’t have notifications on your wrist and it tracks just as much as you need it to! I love the point tracking system too!",5
2528,"It’s a good product, I just don’t like the fact that you have to charge it almost daily even with the tone down. I mostly use it for sleep tracking",3
2529,I was skeptical about purchasing Halo as I also had been looking at the Fitbits.  I am happy that I went with the Halo. It give me all the information that I need.  Because I got the Halo I have now been more active.  It was also half the price of the Fitbits when I bought it.,5
2530,"This screenless smart still needs to be charged daily. I have had it for two weeks, and it won't even last a full day of wearing.  The voice tracking part of it doesn't work most days. You will be disappointed if you buy it for the voice/tone detection features. Say your money and buy a device that doesn't require daily charging.",2
2531,I like the halo app especially the movement and body features of the app because they’re very accurate.  The activity feature is also helpful and the fitness videos make getting in a workout easy.  Tone and sleep features are also useful tools.,5
2532,Very comfortable simple design. The design blends well with any outfit. The functionality is simple and it works well.,4
2533,"The sleep tracking can sometimes randomly not work, but I feel as though that's me laying on it which I have a habit of doing. The live heart rate tracker is extremely nice. I was able to see how high my heart rate went up while playing a horror game. Exercise tracking also works pretty well, haven't had any issues with that.",5
2534,This product is horrible. It is WILDLY inaccurate. It exaggerated my body fat percentage. I lost 6 pounds and it stated my percentage was higher than previously! Both my doctor and trainer told me that it’s readings are completely bogus. That’s not even all that’s wrong with it! I had to reset the device 3 times during the two months I had it! Finally it stopped working completely and after trying to reconnect with technical support for 3 hours I was very frustrated. FINALLY someone agreed to let me return the device. Be aware if your device stops working that technical support does nothing! Also if your device has to be reset (most times it’s not your fault) you lose ALL previous data. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone! I never leave these types of reviews but I feel people should be aware of my horrible experience. UPDATE: I got a 30 dollar alternative and after two months of using I have lost 10 pounds. There are many effective and cheaper alternatives!,1
2535,I didn't need a complicated fitness watch so this fits my life style is just right.  It's very easy to understand and keeps track of information you need for better fitness,5
2536,I love my halo I like that attract my sleep but I never think I sleep well I've used one of the hypnosis the app keeps track of everything you do I haven't set up everything yet but when I'm ready I'll let you know how good it is,5
2537,the band is causing irritation to the skin and can't be worn,1
2538,"I originally thought the basics would be available without a subscription, which is why I bought it. I like the watch, it’s just too pricey as all I want are the basics - activity monitoring and sleep info. Also, it has no alarm feature. The body fat percentage is a nice feature.  If you don’t mind the subscription fee, I recommend this watch. If you just want the basics, go with something else (Fitbit).",2
2539,I'm not sure if the sleep tracking was accurate.  The voice analysis seems more like a novelty and less useful.  I love Amazon products but this halo wasn't for me.,3
2540,hard to tell when it is charged. The app can be frustrating to use. Long way to go to catch up to other fitness trackers.,3
2541,"First and foremost it broke with in months of owning, and I was not hard on it, just normal use. The ""refurbished"" replacement is now not logging activity that I do like working out. It is also uncomfortable to wear. The voice analysis is kind of a joke, I know when I am yelling, laughing, upset...It had great promise, but I think Amazon needs to seriously work on this product some more. I do not recommend this product as of now. It is NOT worth the money.Update: Customer Service rep called me to ask why I didn't like the product and, he was very arrogant, and said he couldn't understand why I had a problem two of the Halo's in a very snarky tone like the problem was on my end, he managed to anger me and creep me out all at the same time.  Amazon this is not cool, if you don't want an honest opinion or are going to be offended don't ask...They won't give me a full refund, buyer BEWARE!!",1
2542,"Fits really nicely and you forget you even have it on.  It gives great explanation on sleep behavior and things to improve sleep.  The battery life could be better, I don’t use the tone feature often as I don’t find it to be accurate or of any valueAdding new review- it’s been approximately 9 months since I purchased this. The device does not charge anymore.  Any now it indicates that my support window from Amazon for this closed so I can’t even get a hold of anyone to get it fixed",2
2543,I love how it doesn't have a screen. I don't need to wear two watches. Does a great job with steps and I love the app...,5
2544,"I begged on twitter for WEEKS that I would finally get a code and I love it. Counts my steps, knows when I'm working harder on my runs, I've used the body scanner and the sleep monitor so far. I haven't done the voice part yet since it eats the battery much faster. Nor have I used the labs yet, but hopefully I will soon.",5
2545,I’m not a huge fan of the watch band. Kinda itchy wish it could be change.,4
2546,Comfortable band love info it provides w just a click on my iPhone,4
2547,"I absolutely love my Halo!!! It gives me a better way to track my activity and my sleep. The only complaint that I have is that the band is cloth. So whenever you a sweating or doing yard work, the band gets dirty and smelly. Overall the Halo is awesome!",5
2548,I like how it tells me my sleep patterns. Also tells you temperature when you're sleeping increases or decreases. The only thing that I don't like is the tone. I have had this since November and still have not been able to get that working. I would love to have that working on my halo because I have kids,5
2549,Love the simplicity and pretty accurate sleep tracking but automatic workout log is very inaccurate and works only with walking and or running.,3
2550,The device is ok. Wish it had other features like blood pressure.,3
2551,"When I  first this product I was very excited about it. I have purchased Amazon electronics for awhile now usually being among the first to try them when they come out, like the Kindle, and fire TV devices. - Which have also seemed to decline in quality lately but this is not about that. First off, the band is kind of clunky and has no digital display but relies on an app for stats. It gives you access to workout and instructional videos but that becomes a subscription service after the initial trial expires. Second, there is a button on it that doesn't appear to move at all when you press it, unless you have fingers the size of a toddler. And finally, I also have a fitbit and often wear both and the steps and sleep counter always seem to vary sometimes by a wide margin even though I am wearing them concurrently. Which one is right? Only God knows and he ain't talking. I am most likely going to return this.",1
2552,I bought this for one of my daughters for Christmas and she loves it. She wears it daily. I definitely recommend it.,5
2553,I have an Apple Watch and it’s alright I love it don’t get me wrong but once I got my halo watch it motivates me to get to where I need to be (in fitness). I’d like the tone feature to tell us a phrase of why I had the mood it gave me. Overall great watch Amazon !,5
2554,"I was really hoping for something that would allow me to gather enough health data throughout the day that I could wear some of my other watches besides always having to wear my Apple Watch. Unfortunately, the Halo was a flop for me. Limited data combined with poor battery life and a finnicky charging cradle made for a bad overall experience for me. It may be suitable for some people's needs but for right now, it just doesn't give me anywhere near enough health data to consider replacing the Apple Watch.",2
2555,"Not impressed with this band. Doesn’t seem to do as much as many of the other ones, and doesn’t seem as accurate in my opinion. I go to sleep at 11:30 and get up at 5:30 and it tells me I slept for three hours and 15 minutes. I have never received a “good” sleep score, and really don’t see much benefit to the tone reader. I think I’ll go back to my Fitbit",2
2556,The sleep partDid not like to tone as no matter what I said it was never happy even when I wasLiked the BMI part of the app,3
2557,"Tried for 2 hours maybe, made my wrist itchy and red. I do have extra sensitive skin though so I'll take half the blame.",3
2558,"I loved the Halo, wore it day and night, with a sport band.  Turned the voice feature off, as I didn't agree with it.  Used scan, sleep and exercise tracking.  But out of the blue, it simply stopped charging...worked fine one day, and then never again.  Luckily, the free trial period was extended until August, so I turned it off.  No way to get hold of Amazon or Halo support of course, so it was a waste of the initial investment.",2
2559,"Worst charger ever. I've had this since Oct 2020 and the battery lasts 3 days without using the voice/tone application. There are some improvements that I'd like to see such as the ability to see my heart rate at certain times of the day in review rather than just a line graph with the Max identified. Id like a slide bar along the line to see the heart rate earlier in the day. Sleep tracking seems to be accurate. Overall, it's nice but the terrible charger is a huge problem.",2
2560,Only had it 2 days and the band broke.,3
2561,"I have no complaints as of yet.  Registers my sleep pretty well.  The body scan  and % of body fat is off, but then again so are most scans.  It has only been a month will add to my review when i get more data.",5
2562,"Love my halo watch it does everything o need it to plus more! I’ve been on a diet the last 6 months and it keeps up with my body mass index as I’m losing the weight! The small fits perfect and doesn’t aggravate like some watches do while your trying to sleep, very comfortable!",5
2563,"I have seen my mom and sister get a fit watch and they had made progress. I decided to get one and I truly love it. The battery life is 2 days worth but totally worth the purchase. Along with 6 month free subscription, yes please!",5
2564,"Great for sleep tracking, mobile app isn’t difficult to understand. Then only issue was the activity tracking would be off sometimes and need to be reset.",3
2565,"Okay, so far I really like it. The tone kind of throws me off because I’m not angry all the time haha. I have a rude tone of voice which I knew lol. But other than that I like the sleep tracking. I’m going to try out the body mass this week. I’ll update mr review as I wear more",5
2566,Battery life leaves something to be desired.  Trouble syncing most of the time.  Miss a face on the Halo - have to keep checking from your phone.,3
2567,"Overall more accurate for steps and sleep, and far better app features and more innovation than Fitbit. Missing altimeter but then again I ain't climbing mountains! Wore both for 2 weeks and I've moved to Halo. I miss the watch face but that's about it.",5
2568,"Big help on tracking my activities throughout the day. Chose not to use voice recognition, just got tired of worrying about what halo interpreted my interactions. Sleep tracking has helped me tremendously. Bought in November and used most of the time. Great value and has helped me with my overall health by sleeping better and weight loss.",5
2569,"It's fine, but I still find other trackers more useful. I did like the voice detection feature. This feature should be enhanced.",3
2570,Very disappointed overall with Amazon and Halo product (experience and app not worth your time and money):1) Materials look cheap for the price2) Device too bulky for what it does (it is 2021 Amazon! you guys need to put everything in a chip and make it razor thin!)3) The band should be bigger (I ordered a Medium size band but it was tight)...I am not a Large.4) I have seen better sleep tracking wearble devices and app interface.,2
2571,"It’s alright, but it would be nice if it hooked up with Apple health so I could get the data into other apps",3
2572,while wearing this device something caused a blemish-irritation on my arm.,4
2573,I wasted a whole evening trying to get this thing to work. Getting it to to connect and go through the setup process took multiple attempts.Even after I managed to get it setup the device wouldn't connect long enough to sync data or use the live monitoring setting.This is such a disappointing product coming from Amazon.Update: Tech support contacted me and told me to disable battery optimization for the Halo app. This seemed to make the setup process faster but the device still has trouble connecting and syncing.,2
2574,Brilliant idea but the voice feature just doesn't work. I'll be talking all day at work and it'll record maybe 9 seconds on a good day. The sleep tracker says I'll be waking up all night but I wake up feling refreshed. Idk if I got a faulty one or if it just isn't ver good but I can't really recommend it.,2
2575,It's number of apps is so amazing. The labs are incredible. But the battery now lasts 18 hours. That's with the optimizing for voice.,3
2576,Seems to be very accurate sleep information.  Have not used many other features.,4
2577,"Does seemingly less than a FitBit (sentiment analysis is a gimmick rn, needs work). App is weird and provides little to no feedback on a daily basis.",3
2578,"I like that this does more than a Fitbit but less expensive in terms of upfront cost. I love the sleep data, insomnia often plagues me and data to compare against sleep hygiene procedures is helpful. Getting the halo, iPhone 7s, and app to synchronize and work together was extremely difficult. Amazon should work on that area of the product.",5
2579,"The body scan on the Amazon halo reinforces my body dysmorphia. I am 4’ 11’’ and weigh 99lbs, my BMI is 19.9. The halo says I am 29% body fat. 30% is obese. How can this be true?!?! Also, it only rewards cardio exercises. I’ll earn 90 points for a cardio workout and 10 for weight lifting. I am only 22 years old. Amazon needs to think of the mental health effects this can have on young impressionable minds because it is messing with my mental health.",2
2580,"I’ve had the Halo for only 10 months and it stopped charging. I tried different outlets, and even ordered a new charging clip, but nothing worked. Amazon is refunding my purchase price and that is the only reason for 2 stars. When it did work it was useful for tracking steps and sleep, but it’s a useless piece of metal now after less than a year.",2
2581,The app has a lot of workout videos/meditation/sleep sounds. They are good but I use another app for all this. The band tracks sleep and movement but my Apple Watch does the same. I don’t use the tone feature because the battery dies too quickly. The BMI feature is cool. I am over all disappointed.  I was hoping it would be more like the whoop and motivate me to workout. If you are new to fitness or don’t have another fitness tracker it could be helpful.,2
2582,"Product is not worth it. Half the features don't work.  The body compisition has not worked for me since day 1. I got it early back in October. The Tonal feature for your voice does not work since day 1 too.Now lets talk about the features that do work.  They work occasionally, the sleep activity function. Sometimes it will sync with your phone. Not always,  every few days I will not get any data on my sleep patterns cause it cant sync.For activity. this feature is buggy. Im a avid gym person.  I don't know if it a delay in sync to the phone for data. Some days I will be at gym lifting weights and doing cardio, running 7 miles. It shows nothing, Then on my day off where I was lazy and being a couch potato, it says I will be active.Who knows what is going on.I only like it cause it is not flashy and small. However, it would be nice if it worked.",1
2583,"I just can’t kick my Fitbit habit. I have an Iconic and this is just too simple for what I’m use to. It fit well and looked fine but it didn’t do as much as I thought it would and to be honest I don’t care about my tone :) I also thought it was kind of lame that the reason I wanted it was because it did body comp, but that you can only use if you keep the membership. Without the membership it’s a basic step tracker.",2
2584,"After several weeks of wear, the sleep tracker still does not perform well. The tone part doesn't really do what I expected, and wears the battery down rapidly.",3
2585,I don't like that the battery dies so quick with the TONE on but it works good,3
2586,"The tone (of voice) feature doesn't work. Can't calibrate or analyze my voice to run the app although I've tried numerous times. The body fitness can't calibrate or analyze my body to run the app, again, I've tried numerous times.  The programs within the system won't load the videos. So then it says I've failed my program because it wasn't run. But each time I try to run the video, the entire Halo app closes itself. Basically all this can do is count my steps and analyze my sleep.",2
2587,I love the app and the Halo band. I have turned off voice analysis as that ate up battery and told me what I already knew. I love the little workouts they have on the app. So nice to use. I have been very satisfied and have lost a few pounds. So it does help out,5
2588,"I have owned the Halo band since November 2020. I also own a Polar Vantage M HR monitor watch and use a Polar H10 HR chest strap. The heart rate measurement compared to the Polar during exercise is incredibly inaccurate. After finishing a set of squats the Halo shows 114 BPM. The Polar shows 148. 47 minutes of circuit training gives me little credit. If I am doing yard work where my HR is 70% of maximum HR, it is accurate after about 10 minutes. Anything above 85% maximum HR is sporadically captured. I had hoped updates would make this more accurate. Way beyond my return window. I would not recommend this product.Update 9/25/2021Screen shot of a bike ride showing my heart rate measured by Polar h10 chest strap versus the Halo Band. The Halo is a joke for measuring exercise. If I could return it for a refund I would. I am canceling the monthly subscription.",1
2589,I really wanted to like it but there is somethings that they need to work on.Things I liked about it:Exercise trackingPoint systemSleep trackingThings disliked:- causes burn on wrist (photo taken today and still have a mark even after not having it on for 2 months)- app too complex and just too crowded- mood mode drains the battery and no one to disable it- bad battery life,2
2590,"The best thing about the Halo band is the way it tracks my sleep. I didn't find the other applications to be very useful for me. But the real problem using the band is that it causes a rash where it touches my skin on whichever wrist I wear it on. It kind of scares me that it does so, because I don't know what other damage it may be causing under the skin. I tried moving it from wrist to wrist to see if I got different results, but I didn't. I'm surprised because I trust Amazon to put out a fully tested and healthy product. Unfortunately, by the time I confirmed it was the Halo band causing the rash, it was too late to return it. That's a hundred bucks down the drain, and this will have to go in the garbage. I can't risk giving it to someone else who might get the same result. Live and learn!",1
2591,"Overall > i’ve been expermenting w apple watch, whoop and halo for the past few months. The halo gets 2 stars bc price is affordable and its relatively comfortable. Otherwise...- the app is polluted with a million things to do- the sleep tracker gives you basically the same score every night- charging is clunky- did not recognize fitness activity automatically- did not pair w peloton- did not change my behavior similar to whoop. Way too complicated vs keeping it simple to understand sleep and strain",2
2592,Love keeping track of my activity! Helps to keep me motivated. The sleep tracker is nice but not sure how reliable. Some nights I feel like I am up a lot and it seems to still give me a good sleep score.I do love the labs for stretching and workouts!So glad I purchased!,5
2593,I like the app and love the tracking ability,4
2594,"Halo is everything I wanted and described. I love the battery life. After having it for a while I wish it had a watch, that is the only drawback for me. I haven't used the sound.",5
2595,"I have owned this for 9 months - Amazon has made great improvements even over the last several months. I like the simplicity of the fitness points, the sleep score ( keep in mind there is a sleep score and sleep efficiency score). I’m happy!",5
2596,The device gave me a rash that took six weeks to heal.Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin.,3
2597,"The app is disorganized and hard to use, and I hate not having the watch face.  Definitely not an upgrade from the Fitbit.",3
2598,"I like the Halo App, but I didn’t like that I couldn't glance at the band for time or steps.",3
2599,So far this has worked for what I needed.,4
2600,Would not sinc up with mobile phone!,2
2601,"I love this product. I wear a Fitbit on the other arm, and it’s pretty much step for step. The sleep tracker, and voice tracker are pretty cool. Still tinkering to learn more. I do wish I could have like a competition with my wife that would be fun. The classes are pretty intense and great for me since I travel",5
2602,"Yes I received it and then I had to go to online support  to find out how to use it, when any of this devices come with instructions and are intuituve. But I found the worst customer support ever....slow, unprepared and tecnically useless. Lets start by saying that Amazon advertised the Halo Band as compatible with iOs and Android, but after 2 hours looking I could not find the Amazon Halo app on Google Playstore. I have a Samsung galaxy note 9, android version 10, and all softwares were updated. Now I have an expensive and useless band that I will love to return, but as international customer (and 15 years spending a lot of money on amazon) now I have to pay for the international shipping to send it back. Pretty nice!! Very very dissappointed.",1
2603,Returned this item. It's great for exercise and weight loss but not for a senior citizen who needs it for medical reasons,3
2604,"The Halo was great, in fact, I found it more useful than the Apple Watch.But then I got a new iPhone. The Halo wouldn’t pair with it, despite hours on the phone with Amazon tech support.The tech person concluded the Halo was defective —but get this—since Amazon is out of stock on Halo, somehow they are unable to issue a refund!So now I’m stuck with a useless, defective hunk of plastic, Amazon has my $$, and I feel SO ripped off.",2
2605,"Love everything about it, the feel, fit and all the fascinating features! I am learning so much about how my body performs that I never knew. Thought I was sleeping great, but not according to Halo...no wonder I'm always tired. love the prompts to exercise and all the different Labs. Would like to be able do more than 5 labs.",5
2606,"Disappointed, the heart rate monitor is much lower than what my Fitbit used to be. Also, every time I work out, my heart rate won’t increase until I shake my arm and then it jumps up into the intense classification. It’s horrible.",2
2607,Needs charging every 2 days and takes so long to charge that I lose another day of tracking. Was hoping for more around body shape and voice recognition--how do I sound--not enough there to make it worth wearing. Done wearing it already after a couple of weeks. Going back to my fitbit.,1
2608,"Sleep tracking - nope. Doesn't get duration or time to fall asleep right.Steps - close enoughHR monitor - all over the place. lots of random drops and spikesAuto tracking for workouts - goes with HR monitoring, so nope.Body scan thing - nope. This is kind of cutting edge, so I guess they at least get a star for trying. It's not accurate at all, though.The app - it opens when I ask it to. So, plus. Very basic, and I'm not upset about that. I don't get notifications for the little challenge things though, so that's dumb.What else do you want to know? The answer is that it probably doesn't work right.Update: I've developed some sort of rash/irritation where the sensor is. Red, itchy and painful. I've made sure to clean it, but that doesn't seem to help. I also don't wear it in the shower and make sure it's completely dry after a workout before putting it back on.",1
2609,"The Halo is light enough to wear on the wrist that it does not interfere at nighttime. It does a reasonable accurate job of sleep tracking and step counting. I still have not explored all the claimed features like Tone, Heart Rate monitoring, etc. to comment.Thus far, I feel it is good value for money.",5
2610,Disappointed with battery-have to charge 4 times a day.  Hard to charge with original band.  After purchasing silicone band fitting into charger became easier.,3
2611,"This fitness band is perfect for my husband and I!!!!!!!! We both have become more active because the point system is SO motivating! Our sleep has also improved a ton because we can see some of the issues we have. Overall, my quality of life has increased because of this band.",5
2612,I bought this watch and it would not maintain a charge after a short time using.  I sent it back and it was replaced with a second watch which lasted maybe a week.  This was a very very poor purchase.,1
2613,"Amazon's attempt at a fitness band is mixed but basically a pass.  Sleep app is above average; tone feature has no value (inaccurate and wears down the battery), body fat indicator is a good feature.  Other features are pretty standard.  Charging harness is plain awful.  Not worth the initial and certainly not ongoing monthly expense.",2
2614,Cloth band start to smell and is not easy to clean. When wearing at night it also chafes.,2
2615,"The device seems very inconsistent. Sometimes I can be on a long, hilly hike, say 2+ hours and get 6K ""light"" steps; other times a 1 hour, flat walk will result in ""moderate"" effort that generates the same steps and more ""points"". It seems to be very dependent on how much I swing my arm. The ""sleep"" function shows similar inconsistencies. I've had to reset the device several times to get it to reconnect to the app. The ""tone"" and body fat functions are pretty much useless.",2
2616,It is awesome how it can track everything. The only thing bad about it is didnt put it on for about a week and I can't get it to sink back up with the app I will have to call at some point to get it figured out. It is a great device.,5
2617,"The idea of what the Halo is supposed to be is great, but this thing is just not ready for prime time. 1/7 nights it just doesn’t track your sleep. 1/4 workouts it just doesn’t register. Often it just won’t sync with the app. Issues are magnified when battery is 20% or less, which is daily. Body fat estimate  is almost 10% higher than an InBody scan. Don’t waste your money on this right now, wait for Halo 2.0.",2
2618,"I’m very frustrated.. after wearing my band for about a month & be extremely careful with it (no water on it, etc) it all of a sudden would not connect to my Bluetooth. I had to do a complete factory reset & lost all of my data. I guess I should’ve spent a little more a& just gone with a Fitbit. It was great up until today & I’ve spent the last 2 hours trying to trouble shoot which finally ended with a total reset. Not happy.",2
2619,"Love the sleep tracking, get too see how much I am actually sleeping and waking up. Fits great not too tight and I actually forget it's there sometimes lol. The mobile app is easy to use and looks great. The voice recognition is great, very interesting to see how you talk to different people.",5
2620,"With the current features, I can tell you it's going to need a better battery.",3
2621,The halo itself breaks out my wrist.. it’s dry itchy and red,4
2622,"I was one of the early adopters who really wanted to love the device and had it for a couple of weeks before returning it. My deal breaker is that it always requires an active internet connection to track my steps and location. I use it to track how much far I have hiked and I cant do this without a data connection - which you are not going to have during a hike into the wilderness. Why Amazon, why?",2
2623,"The Halo is a great device. I really like the sleep tracker, it is the most accurate one I have used and the app explains the different levels of sleep very well. The tone analyzer is also a very cool feature and seems to be fairly accurate. I really like my Halo. It's light weight and low profile.",5
2624,"Mostly usefuk, though sleep accuracy is sometimes odd. The wristband is uncomfortable and ugly. Replacement bands are also unattractive and absurdly expensive at $25.",3
2625,It didn't sync up with my weight watchers program.,3
2626,"Do not buy the halo device. Spend your money on something reputable like Fitbit or Apple Watch. The Halo product managers DEFEATURE your device to not show sleep data, even though it is part of the hardware, when you don’t pay $3.99 for premium features (such as fitness classes that are on demand).  My heartburn with this is that the sleep data is tracked by the hardware you wear on your wrist; it is inherently built in and you don’t need to access online data such as fitness classes. This is, in my opinion, very poor taste. You have already bought the device with whatever middleware came with the hardware. Amazon does an OTA-over the air deprovisioning to stop the sleep functionality from working. This is way too big brother and a scammy practice.In short, do not waste your money.",1
2627,The product was good in the beginning and then it would no longer let me sync it to the app.,3
2628,"I bought this as a pre-release to try it out as it looked promising.Two major issues:1) The mobile app is terrible - it’s super slow on my iPhone 8+ and the usability is mediocre. Don’t get me wrong... it looks beautiful, but the UX is difficult.2) the battery life is really poor (1x every night), so I find myself missing sleep cycles... which is why I bought it originally.Until the app and battery life gets fixed I can’t recommend it.",2
2629,"Love my halo! I have not done the body composition feature yet but the other features are fantastic! It is really helping me understand my whole life goals and attitudes.  The app is easy to use, band charges quickly and lasts a long time. It is not a fitness tracker.  It's a whole life tracker.",5
2630,"I can't complain since I got this at a discount when it was first offered but after putting it to use, I found that the steps application is typically off by 20 to 30% from several other devices that tend to agree within a few % and the sleep monitor does not accurately reflect my sleep patterns.  So I'm giving it 2 stars for effort but it isn't worth the price.",2
2631,"After using this for nine months, the accuracy seems to be diminishing. It no longer tracks my sleep at all, and says that I must be wearing it wrong. But I'm still wearing it the same way as at the beginning. The activity tracking also says I am only getting just a fraction of what I am doing, like 4 minutes instead of thirty. I am disappointed and will discontinue its use.",2
2632,Love the product. Could have some improvements but it’s a good start,4
2633,I really liked using the product besides from that it can import the information into the health app or into my fitness tracker. I don't know if it craped out on me because I wore it in the shower? I feel like for a $100 watch (the price of the device last year) it should last me at least an entire year. I tried contacting support because I wanted a replacement device and I got told I would basically need to buy a new device which I think is bery unfair. Do better Amazon! Gonna try out a Fitbit.,1
2634,"Halo has a bit of an identity crisis. I love the fact that there’s no display, so it can be paired with a normal watch, but the interface and metrics tracking are basic at best. I don’t use the tone or body fat tracking since I don’t think they’re useful. The instant heart rate is good but the activity metric isn’t really thought out. Battery life is the only highlight apart from small size. This could be a killer wearable if the metrics were beefed up.",2
2635,Step counter differs widely from my fitbit. Worry about the accuracy.,4
2636,"I’ve been using my Halo for about two weeks and I’ve been super happy with it. The sleep tracker is accurate and the activity tracker helps me count calories. I’m looking forward to seeing what Labs they add over the next few months.If you’re looking for a fitness tracker, I definitely recommend trying out a Halo",5
2637,Got this for my mother for Christmas. She loves it,4
2638,The workout programs are great. The sleep tracking is inaccurate and rather bad. It'll tell you you slept great when you got six hours of sleep and feel terrible. The voice tracking is a joke it basically will always tell you you are sad.Edit - after leaving this review amazon tried calling me from a customer service person to rectify any trouble shooting. This seems to suggest to me they are trying to keep the poor quality of the devices secret. Your mileage may vary.,2
2639,didn't seem to track as well as my other devices. liked the size and weight.,3
2640,I got this to try since WW had a part in designing it and thought it would track my activity points better than other watches.  However I do crossfit and sometimes the program work outs can be short or involve strength training. If your heart rate does not get up enough for 15 minutes the watch will not pick up that you did an activity and unlike the other watches there is no way to manually start a workout on the watch. I went back to my FitBit.,2
2641,"I have liked it ok, but the sleep tracker has stopped syncing and that’s why i got it in the first place.",3
2642,"The band comes with compared to other fitness bands like body scan and tone analysis. Body scan is nice but feels like it is slightly overestimating the fat percentage. Tone seems to interesting, based on my observation prediction seems to be correct to certain extent. how useful it will be to make ourselves better needs to be seen",5
2643,I am still trying to get this to respond to my Android so I have not been able to use it.,3
2644,Keep popping off band,3
2645,"I wish that I had returned this while I still could. It seems to be getting worse with time. Heart rate tracking while exercising (shoveling snow, rowing, elliptical) is all over the place. My heart rate suddenly drops to the 90s from 130-145 while I am in the middle of the workout, or it stays stuck in the 90s and then suddenly jumps to what it should be 130-145. Nothing I do (adjusting the band) fixes this. Bottom line, it sucks and I do not recommend.",2
2646,"Very comfortable to wear all day long. Love that it tracks without me having to do much of anything. It updates all my activity points to my WW app, just wish it also did that for sleep details but that is minor.  Seems very accurate with sleep and activity tracking. Very happy with Halo overall.",5
2647,My sleep is not recorded properly. Sometimes nit at all.,3
2648,Cons:1.) Bulky2.) Uncomfortable3.) Tone isn't very accurate4.) App isn't the best5.) Not many features add value of the subscription6.) Charger is very hard to use7.) Bands expensive and smallPros1.) Easy setupSo far I am not very happy with this band but we will see.  I might return it after I try it for a few more weeks,2
2649,"Although the goal of this device is admirable, I found its execution wanting. I was most interested in it’s voice analysis, but the info it provides is skimpy. It tells me that at a certain time, I sounded sad or whatever, but without recording to demonstrate, I have no idea what the rating is for. On the fitness side, my Apple Watch is a far superior device for measuring physical performance daily and weekly. The most useful tool is the sleep measurement, but I don’t have great need for that.",2
2650,"If I wanted someone to scold me, I would have moved back with my mother. This device is the most negative that you can find out there. I workout daily, riding my bike intensively at least an hour, yet nothing seems to satisfy this device. Out of my hour of workout, it registers about half the time and says that only like 5 minutes were intense, etc. Because I usually work for the rest of the day, it takes out points for being too sedentary. Hello? The calories that I burned that day are solid, why would you disconsider my efforts. Then it gives me the same tip every day about drinking water before meals as if nobody even took the time to add something else besides that to a list of positive advice. Also, the voice and body recognition features are super invasive. Overall, with all its negativity and lack of privacy, this device is not exactly what I need during a pandemic. Going back.",1
2651,"Sleep tracking is great. Interesting to see wake ups and such.Fitness tracking leaves some to be desired. “Activity” is very broad, and could use some exercise specific options/details.App offers programmed workouts, which is pretty awesome for those looking for some guidance. Anywhere from yoga, to full routines.Overall, worth the investment.",5
2652,It’s an unreliable piece of tech. I was a long time Whoop user (annoying $30/mo fee; starts to not work properly over time) and my wife has the newest Apple Watch (big cost upfront; reliable most of the time). The Halo is the most appealing of the three cost wise but it’s the worst choice of the three. You have to pick your poison with these watches. I’m leaning towards a refund.,2
2653,I absolutely love my halo. When I go take a shower I put it to charge and it's full by the time I get out. I use the tone reader so the battery needs that daily charge. I got my mom one I love it so much! I'd love to get my boyfriend one soon!,5
2654,"I really don’t like wearing a watch. In the past I have bought like six watches and never wore them. From the day I put this on, I wear it all the time except while changing or I’m in  the shower.  I really like my phone alerts to to change it.",5
2655,"Too bulky, didn't like not being to see screen without app. Band was uncomfortable when wet. Not the band for me",3
2656,"Great product, high-quality",5
2657,"Excellent.  Replaced my other step tracker and is quite accurate for exercise.  Accompanying programs are realistic and confidence boosters.  Tone feature i admittedly haven't used much but plan to.  I wear this thing everyday.  Absolutely essential and has helped me lose 30lbs, greatly improved sleep and lowered my stress.",5
2658,This product is just so-so. I really like the Velcro band a lot. The tracking app is what you’d expect. My biggest complaint with this is that you have to have your phone with you all the time if you want to get data from this. There’s no watch aspect or easy way to get how many steps you’ve done without looking at your phone. If it would only have an illuminated face to tell time and steps I’d be in love.  The sleep function is pretty cool.,2
2659,"It doesn't do anything other than measure health numbers, no watch or anything. The monthly subscription is required for it to work.I knew all of that going into it. Ultimately, what made me return it was that I found it very uncomfortable to wear.  The return was relatively easy, but they charged for shipping unless your returned it to their warehouse.I ended up getting a Fitbit Charge 4. It was more comfortable for me, and it get a few smartwatch features.",2
2660,"Some clever features but went south when it stopped charging.  Product support sent a replacement unit; I returned the broken one.  Got lost in the mail I suppose so was then charged again for the device.  Disgusted with that output so sent the replacement unit back via UPS.  So I have no Halo and I bought it twice.  Until they become more reliable and sort out the return process, suggest you pass.",2
2661,I turned off the live features for to it draining the halo battery so much. I really like the sleep & activity stats. I'm not sure what costs to expect when my trial period ends. I liked the look and it is very comfortable.,5
2662,I am allergic to nickel. The metal part of this touches your skin. There is on way I can wear it.,3
2663,"Requires premium subscription for only real useful features (sleep and activity) just gives a super limited summary.no way to access your own datano longer charges after 2 yearsseemed more accurate than Oura ring, however.",2
2664,"I like the tracker, just wish it came with a watch.",4
2665,I have had it just over a year (by a week or two) and the sensor cover came off. The black glue seems to have melted?  And so it’s done. I didn’t even wear it the whole year. I don’t believe my body temperature is such that I should be able to melt parts off. Luckily I didn’t pay full price but still. I can’t afford a new one. Sad.**UPDATE**Ok so I was contacted about this after I submitted my initial review and they are processing a refund which I did not expect.  Because of this I decided to buy a new one in the hopes I will not have the same issue. So thank you Amazon for not only good business practices in this situation but even being proactive about it.,1
2666,"Set up was easy, but the sleep tracking can not recognize noon napping. Charging station is not secure enough.",3
2667,"I love the benefits of the sleep and voice tracking. The fit feels great, not an issue when sleeping either. I work on a computer and doesn’t bother me there either. I love the notifications and reminders settings as well. The main issue I have is the battery life. I’m probably charging every other day. It’s nice, sleek and for the amount spent, not too big of an issue but less than 48hrs and needing a charge is kind of ridiculous in my opinion.",2
2668,I’ve had it for a couple of months. I love it and it does everything I need. But I’ve recently started getting burns where the sensor is. —-not cool & also painful,1
2669,"Weak, weak battery. Lasts at the most 2 days. They sent me a new unit but it was a refurbished one! Like to see how that is accomplished. Then they denied I returned the FitBit at all. They undoubtedly lost it in the mess that is their return warehouse system. They used to believe the customer. Not any more.  Correction: ...I returned the Halo at all.",2
2670,"There were many complaints about what this device didn't do compared to other fitness devices. I KNEW what this device was supposed to track. My problem with it was that it didn't always work. It worked great for about a week, then when I would check my stats, I discovered it hadn't been tracking the entire day because it was offline or it wasn't connected to my blue tooth. The only consistent thing about this device was that it didn't work. I was very disappointed.",2
2671,Is anyone else experiencing the led colored lights turning only white?,3
2672,My band lasted almost 2 years.  It was experimental at first and got better every month.  Worn all the time except when it was charging.  I probably will buy another.,5
2673,The only complaint I have is when you have the voice on it drains the battery very fast.,3
2674,"This tracker is not worth the money.  It is hard to charge, I have had it on the charger for 3 days with the red light on and it is still not charged.  You have to have your phone to see any stats.  I am in meetings a lot and like knowing what time it is and it doesn't have a watch feature and to wear both the tracker and a watch is really bulky.  I will go back to using my Fitbit.",2
2675,I was expecting it to track blood pressure. I wake feeling rested but the Halo says my sleep was fair.,3
2676,"This product is great, I am giving it a three star because the batter life only lasts about 24 hours.",3
2677,"Just don't - it's bulky, sluggish to sync, doesn't track anything particularly well - and the app is overloaded with nonsense. The charging cradle belongs in 2008.Certainly nothing I would consider paying for after the 6-month trial service wise.On day 3, I do a mid-day check to discover that it's not connected and trying to navigate me to setup all over again. After a factory reset, the device isn't discoverable.Return and learn!",1
2678,"I love that it keeps me informed on how much my heart rate is on average,  but almost EVERYTHING ELSE it's claimed to fame is absolutely has the worst accuracy in my history of smart watches, and I've never spent more than$25 prior to this purchase on one. DO NOT BUY THIS! It doesn't track sleep correctly, at all, it counts time charging as your time spent being immobile (stagnant), it doesn't record the tone of voice used and is only helpful in that area if you know what you were talking about at whatever time it happens to pick up on something it hears - or you can watch it in real time, if you're capable of holding an actual conversation AND track your tone of voice at the same time.  Literally useless.  0 stars.",1
2679,"I wish  the battery charge  lasted long. And I'm not sure how the voice recognition works?? I do wish it had the time on the band, I find myself looking at it because my other band displayed the rime.",5
2680,Love it. It inconspicuous — it looks like you’re wearing a bracelet while tracking your physical activity. I like the fact that it doesn’t show your fitness information on a screen that anyone can see  while you’re hanging out. I think the voice analysis is really cool and spot on.,5
2681,"just got this band today the ""weekly"" goal is 150 I can say for a fact I have been laying in my bed for about 5 out of the 7 hours I have had it on and I am at 77 points already this week... the steps seem to be accurate but I think the heart beat sensor is a little off. to feed on that I have zero sed points.  and even typing this I went up 8 points I don't think this is accurate",2
2682,The device is ok.  Customer serviceIs lousy in answering questions /or help resolve issue. Nothing stands out about this device,3
2683,"I bought the Halo in November mostly because I liked the size of it, and thought I'd try it instead of my Apple watch.  Tracking my sleep was really good.  But last night while sleeping the back fell off and it is no longer working.  Didn't expect that after four months especially as I always took off when bathing or showering.Back to my Apple!Update Amazon called and sent me a refurbished replacement.",2
2684,I bought to one for my husband and my self. It has really helped with our fights and communication. And we can also keep track of our sleep. I wish I had got this sooner.,5
2685,"The idea for the product was great, and I liked the body scan capabilities. However, it falls short in the reading of measurements. Compared to my heart rate monitor and apple watch, the halo band was off on heart rate by 30-40 beats per minute during exercise. My sleep was tracking was wild because some nights it would say I didn't sleep at all or not track it. I like the styling, size and capabilities of the band and app, I just wish it was accurate.",2
2686,I have had this for only 4 months and I am already having issues with it syncing to the app and tracking sleep quality most nights. The sizing guide for the band suggests to size up if you’re between sizes but not the band is too big. I thought I’d just purchase a new band but the band alone is a third of the price of a new Halo. I wish I had just purchased a FitBit.,2
2687,"So far, very happy with purchase.  I have multiple “fitness” trackers and like the data the device provides.  Easy to set up and to use.  Body shape is a nice feature to have and use as a bench mark.",5
2688,"I absolutely love this watch but I’m wondering why I am getting this rash from it. I thought it may have nickel but it would be itching and it doesn’t, it just looks gross. It could be from me keeping the watch too tight and sleeping w it like that and sweating hmm",5
2689,I thought I was going to have certain things automatically take hold and give me readings the next day. Such as sleeping patterns. I found I had to manually set each night or I received no readings at all. The steps I took were also not automatic. I never figured out what I was supposed to do for that.  And by now even having a watch to look at made the device an unnecessary purchase that I could not benefit from. So I returned it.,2
2690,The halo seemed to work very well. It was lightweight and comfortable. The majority of the features are attached to paying for a membership. After the free membership trial was over the Halo is essentially just a heart rate monitor. The features that come with the membership also don't feel like it is worth $4/month.,2
2691,This got me to cancel my Prime account.  Really surprised Amazon would release such an expensive data collector for them with no benefits for the user.  My Samsung fit 2 works way better.  The Halo band would miss sleep and workouts.  Did not matter what wrist it was on.  Fit 2 has a longer batter life and a color screen.  The Halo app is not even close to the Nike training app or other free excerise apps.  This really has nothing to justify its price.  The body fat measuring is not the best either.  The had held one's work better.  This is Amazon charging you to collect your data to build their health app.  Wish I would had returned it,1
2692,Sleep information did not sync with weight watchers app as was advertised. And that is why I bought it.,3
2693,The sleep tracker wasn’t always accurate,4
2694,The Halo sensor open up and became unglued. This is not at all well built!,3
2695,"UPDATE: Amazon released an updated version of the app. It seems to recognize these disconnects and now prompts you immediately to do a factory reset (This might help to create a clearer path to reset the device. But doesn't solve any of the problems with Halo). Then displays a couple extra screens in the setup process that basically seems to accuse people of manually un-pairing their Halo via their device bluetooth settings. Or being too dumb to read the ""double press the button to sync"" banner across the app. So no surprise, these cosmetic changes didn't fix the real issue.Useless. Disconnects from the mobile app daily (sometimes twice) and needs to be factory reset to reconnect. Which deletes all of the data for the period it was disconnected. And you never know when it's going to disconnect. So, you never know if it's tracking or not. I feel like it would be a great product if it were reliable. I'm using a Pixel 5.",1
2696,"Mine started acting funky about 3 months ago so I stopped wearing it. Charged it up today to see what's up and got one wear in and the back popped off. Internal stuff exposed, totally useless now and return/warranty period says closed. So I got a total of 6 months of wear out of it. I'm pretty bummed.",2
2697,"Honestly super basic, I bought it tried it and returned it it just seemed super boring. I like watching my steps.",3
2698,I was very excited about the Halo and it worked great..for a couple of weeks then it stopped accepting its chargeI'm not sure what happened - I didn't drop it submerge it (even though its supoosed to be water proof) nothing - just normal wear and one day it stopped charging - I would have accepted a replacement but they were all sold out so now I don't have a tracker because I got rid of my other one & I'm kinda bummed,2
2699,"Sorry Amazon. I just did like this compared to my Fitbit, and or my apple watch.",3
2700,"Amazon did a great job at customer service and hearing my concerns, I just cannot be a member or subscribe to a fitness band whose body scan keeps telling me I’m over 20% more body fat percentage than what I really am at the doctors and all other fitness apps. I had to go instead with Fitbit Sense which I’m loving. Sorry to have to write a bad review.Update: Amazon responded to my review right away and is diligently trying to improve this.",2
2701,"I wanted to like this band and there are many of good things about it. I like that I can see my steps, the recipes and my heart beat. But the sleep tracking, the thing I really got this band for, is just way off. The times are not correct; last night it shows I was in bed asleep from 5:30 PM to 7:30 AM and had deep sleep between 5:30 and 7:00 PM. I was having supper during that time period and was definitely awake. This is disappointing to say the least. How can I count on the rest of the information given if this is so blatantly incorrect? I am also disappointed that I missed the timeframe to send the band back by a day. So, I’d say it’s a fun idea but certainly not worth the money.",1
2702,"Easy to use and sync with my phone once I installed the app on my phone.  It tracks my sleep, activity, tone of voice and even can use to take pics of my body.  It also sync with the WW app.  there is no watch or other features with it, but works great.",5
2703,"I was most excited about the tone features, to understand how I sounded. Halo believes I sound sad and restrained about 90% of the time. Laughing and having fun, Echo categorizes as sad. I tried resetting the sound features many times, doing the baseline reading in my natural voice. Doesn't matter, I apparently just sound sad and restrained at all times. In addition to inaccurately categorizing how I sound, the tone feature resulted in the battery dying after 1.5 days.Overall, the band is uncomfortable. The tracking is inaccurate. The charger is a pain in the rear. I was excited for the potential, but the execution is greatly flawed. I've had fitness trackers and smart watches starting with the Microsoft band, a couple of fitbits including the Ionic and blaze, the amazfit BIP, and Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2, and now the Halo, and the Halo is by far the worst that I've tried.",1
2704,"one way one day, another way the next.",4
2705,"Originally purchased this item for tone of voice and sleeping. After numerous attempts to set up tone, over several days, it never has worked. I continued to use it for sleep tracking before deciding to send it back. It does a decent job of sleep monitoring, but it's inconvenient to have to check cellphone app in order to be certain it's synched. Unfortunately, I missed the return window by 2 days. I was going to return it and ask for a refund.",2
2706,"You cannot use Tone unless you want to charge every 4 hours, and even if you turn off Tone it still uses too much battery.  You actually have to reset the Band and not initiate Tone to get optimal battery.  I love the idea for Tone, but it needs to be severely streamlined.  For the price it is Very limited in what it can do.  I wanted a basic fitness band with less in the app, but this is just disappointing.",2
2707,"Biggest drawback is no integration with Apple health. The sleep tracker also doesn’t always work. The piece of sensor at the bottom of the device that contacts the skin has already fallen off only after a few months. In short, I have stopped using it. Also, the body scanner - I thought it would be something cool to use, I’ve only used it once. I don’t use the voice sentiment.",2
2708,It dose what it says it is a good thing to have. The bad thing is I ordered a large but when I got it it was a medium size and thats what it said on my order form.,5
2709,Very lightweight and durable. I expected the fabric to stink by now. It doesn’t.The sleep tracking feature is extremely accurate when compared against my Fitbit and Apple Watch.,5
2710,Battery needs to charge faster. Wish there was a display on device.,3
2711,I work nights but apparently that doesn’t matter because this is for people who work a standard 9 - 5. If I sleep during the day it DOES NOT TRACK MY SLEEP. Just says I’m lying down for an extended period of time. Real disappointment.,2
2712,The lack of integration with other fitness apps and tracking is the only knock I have.,3
2713,I absolutely love the Halo. I’ve been an avid Fitbit user for years and decided to try the Halo for the voice recognition feature. Upon comparing the data for sleep and activity from my Halo and my Fitbit Aspire I found that the Halo was much more accurate.,5
2714,This my 2nd replacement and it's not working. I noticed it last 6 months to 10 months before a replacement. The battery charger is very annoying. I have move to Apple watch.,2
2715,"Unfortunately, this is falling apart after not even 10 months of use.I was really happy to get the Halo band. It's been great at tracking the intensity of my weight training workouts. Body composition analysis has been a bit higher than expected compared to other measurement methods. At least you can track the direction of fat percentage.",2
2716,"Battery life was only 1 1/2 days.  Quit syncing after one month.  Isn't listed in the chat options for help.  Phone help transferred me multiple times before someone told me to return it.  And after I said I wouldn't pay a restocking fee for an item that didn't work, I was told told they would refund that also.  I was very hopeful this item would work.  So disappointed.  Not the typical Amazon experience for me.",2
2717,"I bought this band and wore it for less than a month before it broke. The app logged me out on its own and said I needed to ""set up an account and pair my device"" even though I had already done that. Then the device never paired to the app again. I tried everything and factory reset it twice. Nothing worked, I am currently in the market for a different band- not by amazon",1
2718,I knew what it was when I bought it but I hate having to rely on the app for everything. a month after I bought it they came out with the new version.,2
2719,I wish is would have active feedback on the watch and not only on the phone as well as tell time.,3
2720,"Everything about this band is promising. But I was disappointed with it. It needs a face/display, just because users want to see something going on. The app is decent but left me confused about regular items that I normally see on other apps. And lastly the cost per month is not worth it especially because there's a ton of free options out there. I can't justify spending the money.",2
2721,I like the app it gives you a lot of different suggestions to do with your diet and exercising and such. I am trying to follow the suggestions but its still a work in progress!,5
2722,"I love this up until it's stopped working all together. I don't know why but it no longer charges, and I don't have a way to contact anyone for support? It's pretty frustrating now, I wish it was still working.",2
2723,I’m not sure the tone of my voice that it records or the words it uses is a true enough indication of my mood. I mainly use this for sleep tracking and it has been very helpful. I need to use the activity portion more and the added help links.,5
2724,"I thought this was a decent product.  I purchased it after my first Fitbit died.  I liked the sleep-tracking  features and the exercise feature.I made the mistake of buying the rose gold. It got filthy so fast and no amount of daily cleaning in the shower made any difference.It stopped syncing to my phone within six months. So now, I'm back to reliable Fitbit.",2
2725,"It’s a good concept when it works. I find if I wear the band any longer than a day (even fully charged) it just stops tracking. I was excited to have tracker that Didn’t have a display. It’s one of the most comfortable bands that I’ve owned but really it’s nothing special. I hate that it stops tracking especially if I know it’s going to be a busy day. Then it will tell me I sat for 90% of my day and deduct “points”. It just over all makes me look lazy when I’m fact I work a job where I am constantly moving/walking.The sleep tracking is okay but if you even knock it once during the night, it stops tracking.The only way I know of to get it working again is to do a factory reset. It’s not convenient to do this every day.Sorry Amazon, it’s just not worth it and you’re probably going to get this one back.",1
2726,"Decent tracking, but creates a sore on your arm that takes forever to go away. I stopped using it all together.",2
2727,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Not only does the Halo provide great information on mobility, body fat, tone, sleep and activity levels, it also provides a wealth of actionable corrective measures.  An absolute game changer!!!",5
2728,"As much as I tried to like it, it just wasn't for me. The activity tracker is okay, sleep tracking is okay. I never used the tone feature, my phone already listens to what I say 24/7.The lack of integrations with other apps is a huge deal breaker though. I know it's new, but it is so important for me, that I ended up going back to my Fitbit.I had to return it as I don't find it useful anymore.",2
2729,This has potential but need many more enhancements to get me to pay a monthly fee.,3
2730,Love The Halo band and App!  Been wearing this for almost a year  Have lost 25 pounds  So love that it links to Weight Watchers!  Love everything about this watch!  Washable fast charging!  Body images and labs!  Love love love!,5
2731,I wasn’t thrilled with this fitness band. I felt like the tracking wasn’t accurate and the battery life was terrible.,3
2732,"This product is a complete waste of money. I bought it cause I like beating able to track my fitness while also wearing a watch on a daily basis; however this thing is a complete waste of money. There is no resting heart rate function and the alarm I use on my phone monitors my sleep as well as this gadget. I find it clunky and unattractive on my wrist. I had better hopes for this device. Sticking with my Apple Watch.*Update since review* immediately after leaving my review, Amazon called and asked for more feedback as this is a new product that they want to further improve. They offered me to send my product back, which surprised me as I had worn it.  I am very improved with the customer service and hope they will continue to develop the product. I do plan to send the product back and maybe after further development, I will give it another shot.",1
2733,"I actually really like the product, but charging this thing is extremely frustrating. The charger that came with it broke after a few uses, and considering I was being kind of rough with it after it wouldn’t work, I’ll take the blame for that. I ordered a replacement and have been delicate with it to ensure it doesn’t break, and I just can’t get it to charge unless I encourage it to work with excessive force. Who designed this? It pretty much requires you do nearly break it every time you try to charge, yet the mechanism that it uses to charge is so delicate. If they redesigned the charger I would give it 5 stars. Luckily the battery life is great if you take away the tone feature which I personally don’t care about, but apparently if you turn that on the battery life isn’t great, which is a huge flaw considering the charger problems. Please make the necessary change.",1
2734,Bought as a gift for my mother. It will not pair with any phone no matter what account we use.,3
2735,"I just love my Halo!  Most of the time I forget that I have it on.  It keeps up with everything and I look forward to checking out my ""readings"" every evening.  It syncs nicely with my Weight Watchers app so I never have to worry about getting my points in.",5
2736,I like this a lot. It's simple and accurate. I like the sleep and activity tracking. The band is extremely comfortable and it's got good battery life. I don't use the labs and haven't tried the body composition thing yet. The voice/mood tracker is interesting. Very good product.,5
2737,"Overall the band is okay. It was accurate and survived 3 very rigorous weeks with me, but I didn't end up finding the information useful. Indo like the idea of game-ifying fitness and health but the Halo doesn't do this in a rewarding way for me.The final straw was waking up with burns on my wrist where the silicon strap ( sports band ) was resting. I am not going out of my way to wear something will consistently damage my skin.",2
2738,"This has helped me with my fitness journey. Keeps me on track with my goals, exercising every day (or nearly). The body fat percentage helps immensely. It's my favorite thing I have bought during the pandemic. Highly suggest purchasing this. Highly. If this goes away, I will bawl.",5
2739,"I don't sleep well, constantly waking/getting up throughout the night.  I really like the sleep tracking. I can see more of when I wake instead of trying to remember. It let's me see the pattern of sleep I have.",5
2740,"Purchased this item and at first I was very excited about it. What I have found it is nothing special, it has useful features but the sleep feature is not accurate at all. It will say for example that you had 4hrs of sleep and give you a bad score but you were asleep for more like 6hrs. The workout point is ok it gives you something to shoot for but again I do not believe that it is accurate. My big complaint with this item however is after about 5 months I began having trouble recharging the watch. I cleaned the connectors and that seemed to work for a few weeks but again I began having trouble with recharging the watch. I cleaned the connectors again but this time it didn’t work and now I can’t recharge it at all. So overall now(obviously) I give this item failing grade all around l.",1
2741,Overall I'd go with something else - this cannot be used as a watch and when you decide you want to use TONE the battery drains completely after 36 hours and it does not tell you the phrase used that was negative or positive so I have no idea what to work on for myself.I was so exited too but I much prefer to use my VeryFitPro smart watch that I paid $30 and does WAY more for me.,2
2742,"When I initially got this product I loved it, and then it stopped working so I returned for a replacement, the replacement didn’t work either. So I’ve sent both back and am waiting for my money to be returned. For the price of the band and the money spent on a monthly subscription I should have at minimum been able to track steps but it could never sync properly.",1
2743,"This thing is a garbage.  I really liked it at first.  It did a very good job of tracking my activity and keeping me motivated, but eventually it would not connect to my phone or app.  I did everything it said to connect to the app, including pressing the button twice, disconnecting the USB when it was connected to the charger, and pressing it twice and then holding it, but I could never get it to reconnect to my phone, which made it useless.  I eventually had to just throw it away since I couldn't get it to connect to the app.  Do not buy this, it will work well at first, then it will become a useless paper weight and waste of money.  I strongly regret the purchase.  Just another terrible amazon product.",1
2744,"Purchased mine 11/9/2020 and really enjoyed it, especially liked the sleep tracking. Two weeks ago while at dinner I felt a burning/itching sensation on my arm and removed the band only to find that the back of the unit had come off and burned my wrist. The pic above is from a week later where I still had a scab from where it burned me. Amazon support ignored my request for a warranty for nearly a week and then said they would only give me a replacement IF I sent them back the broken unit first. I demanded my money back and ultimately got a refund. But not before I was physically burned, ignored, and insulted.  Oh, and I had to send the unit back with proof of shipment before the refund. Still astonished by the lack of customer service or care on this one.",1
2745,"Device seemed to be working initially, but after multiple ""disconnects"" from the band to where no activity was reported for days to forcing me to factory reset the device, the device is more work than it's worth. Maybe the next generation of device will be more stable, but unless you feel like paying to beta test the device and accompanying software, this should be a pass for anyone looking for a good fitness tracker.",2
2746,Battery life is irritatingly short. Sleep tracking counts sitting quietly as sleeping. Activity report is not helpful.,3
2747,I didn’t feel I had a terrible sleep almost every night.  Was uncomfortable to war as well,3
2748,The charger is very finicky otherwise decent.,4
2749,I especially like how lightweight the halo is. I’ve tried several of the “labs” and like the sleep labs best. I just wish there were more band styles and color options at reasonable prices. $24 for 1 silicone band is ridiculous. How about a pack of three silicone bands for $9.99,5
2750,"I'm new to fitness trackers and the Halo has been a good motivator, and the sleep tracking and tone are engaging, but the battery life stinks, IMO.  It's being used only for the basics and can't go 24-hours without a charge. Hopefully I can try the other features without having to carry around the charger.  I've developed a routine to charge daily, but in reading other reviews, it sounds to be sub-par in that area as compared to other products.UPDATE- I'm sorry I purchased this.  It's garbage, won't hold a charge, doesn't synch, basically doesn't work.  It will give my pulse when it feels like it, tracks steps sometimes.  The same with tone and sleep.  Basically a piece of crap.This will be the last time I take advantage of an early purchase price from Amazon.  They should issue refunds to the suckers like me that purchased it.",1
2751,I'm enjoying it so far; I used to track steps with my phone and it's nice not to have to carry that anymore.,5
2752,"It doesn't tell me anything I need to know because I live alone and seldom talk. It is uncomfortable to wear at night and then when do I charge it.Just to make it clear to me that I wasted my money, the fabric of the watch got stuck on velcro on a heating pad and followed it into the microwave. Now the thing is literally useless.",2
2753,"I tried both side of my wrists, and I didn't realized that tracker itself contains nickel, it burned through my skin.",1
2754,I was super excited to get this product and try it out and first thing is I'm very impressed with it. I have only been using it mostly to track my sleep and my steps for the moment but I will definitely try the other features soon and update this post.,5
2755,"I have owned this watch since December. Wearing it everyday. I love it, until it stopped working yesterday. Will not charge or turn on. What a waste. This was great. But now for the price it was I will buy a cheap one to replace. Thanks",5
2756,"The product is just okay. I wanted to make sure that I gave it enough time to make an informed decision. I tried to love it and I tried some more. It works with WW so I gave it more time than I should have.  While I like it, it is just meh. I would return it but of course it is past the return window. So now I am stuck.  Would not recommend purchasing this.",2
2757,I really wanted to know how people perceive me when I speak. I love this function. It helps me keep aware of how I might sound to others when engaging.,5
2758,Generally ok but the software has issues. Doesn't always sych when you want it to and it is slow going from one area to another. I tried the suggestions in the help section but they were temporary fixes and need to be repeated at least once a week. It will probably end up in a drawer soon when my patience runs out.,2
2759,"I will be returning. I have worn both Fitbit and Apple Watch for years (and for a while, both at the same time). This item is bulky and very uncomfortable. The actual device piece is very large, hard, and inflexible. It either has to be cinched so tight that it hurts, or it slides down and bangs itself on my wrist bone. The actual device piece sits up very high off the arm, and it stretches all the way across the wrist. The data is not useful at all. There is nothing I am getting from this that I can’t get from another device, and not having a screen to track progress (even just the dots on Fitbit) makes this invaluable and ineffective.",1
2760,"I like some of the features and the fact that there is no face to distract you like other devices.My biggest complaint is that it subtracts points for being sedentary. my job involves sitting for 8 hours. I doubt that most people are on their feet the rest of the day until bedtime. Since i work out daily, to see points taken away is a little discouraging. Not sure I’ll continue the subscription after 6 months.",2
2761,I like that it keeps a charge for about three days and I can wear it in the shower. I check my sleep tracking every morning. I have not tried the voice recognition yet. I also like the way it tracks your activity as opposed to just steps.,5
2762,I love how it shows my sleep patterns and body temperature.  The only thing I do not like is that in 6 months there will be a 3.99 monthly fee. Not sure what that is for.  As of now both my daughter and I love our Halos.,5
2763,works ok,4
2764,My Apple Watch is more accurate.  The battery on Halo didn’t last like it said it would,3
2765,Love this band. Don’t even notice it on my wrist and love the bi weekly body scans. Has helped me really keep track of my progress. I haven’t used the tone control but because of that my battery last almost a week on one charge,5
2766,If you are looking for an accurate calorie counter if you workout this is NOT the product for you. Twice this week now I  have worn my Apple Watch and Halo to a Corepower Sculpt class and then Barrys class and the HALO was very disappointing to say the least. Apple watch likely much more accurately tracked my heart rate around 185-189 doing treadmill sprints while the Halo read the highest it got was 132 over the course of an hour of which included 25 minutes of treadmill sprints during Barrys. This does not even include the weight lifting portion. The same can be said for the Corepower Sculpt HIIT Class  during 1 hour 6 minute class each  Apple 798 active Calories vs Halo 263. ooooff!,1
2767,"Love it, has accurate measuring of body size and shape. Tracks sleep perfectly. Gives you a proven excessive plan. And lays out health meal prep ideas.",5
2768,"I haven’t tried voice recognition yet but I am so happy with the step counter (I was getting ripped off by another item) and the sleep tracking is very enlightening!  So far, I’m loving my halo!!",5
2769,"From a visual point of view I like the Halo tracker since I am purely interested in the tracking functions.  I would like to see more band options. Here are 2 things I don't like about Halo:1) the band keeps disconnecting. Then when pushing the button 2 times, it still will not reconnect. It will reconnect randomly without rhyme or reason.2) I have an issue with my membership and Amazon / Halo team has not yet figured out how to fix it. :( :(3) The Halo fell apart in August . I had insurance on the product, so I received a refurbished piece instead. That was very disappointing.4) December 25, 2021 the Halo stopped working again. It is completely dead.This is such a disappointment. Not sure if the products warranty will pay for another replacement.:(",1
2770,"I really liked this product in the beginning but I am returning it after a couple months.  The heart rate monitor seems sketchy at best.  I can do the same workout 2 days in a row and end up with 2 very didn't points earned.  I understand that it isn't going to be exactly the same, but my heart rate on the apple watch was showing different from my halo during the same workout.  If you lay down on the couch to watch a movie, the halo thinks you have gone to bed for the night and therefore starts tracking your sleep...which gave me a really crappy nights sleep cause it thought it was sleeping for 12 hours and the first 4 hours of that ""sleep"" wasn't good sleep.  I know this is the first of its kind and I am sure they will work out the kinks eventually but it isn't there yet.",1
2771,"I liked this activity tracker at first but after a few months it quit working. It stopped tracking all together so I did a factory reset. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling. Disconnected and reconnected from Bluetooth and it will not pick up steps, sleep, or heart rate. I haven’t been able to get help from customer service yet but will keep trying.",2
2772,"Update: Amazon refunded me the price of the device. I really like the device but wish the build quality was better.Great device to start with. Didn’t have issues until one day the back faceplate falls off.  I don’t know why or how sine I don’t get the thing wet other than everyday wearing of the device.  Amazon won’t replace it, so I am just gonna return it.  Good performance but mediocre quality I guess.",2
2773,"I was not very happy with the Halo. It is not very practical, have to use your phone to check everything. The charge is short lived. I do not even wear it anymore. I got an android watch and I like it much better. The tone of voice application is I hate to say it a joke. I'm sorry for the unfavorable feed back, but I just was not happy and I wanted to be so much.",2
2774,"The sleep tracker is in accurate, especially if you get up in the night. For example, last night I got up for a few minutes at about 1:30 am and then went back to sleep until 6. When I first synced the Halo when I got up, it only showed my sleep until I got up the first time. I re-synced it and then it would only show sleep from when I went back to sleep until 6. It should have registered the first time I got up as a disturbance and had the entire night showing. It’s also wildly different to the readings I got on my Fitbit Charge 3 when I used them on the same night.Lastly, I don’t appreciate how you lose most of the tracking functionality if you don’t pay the monthly fee. It’s not worth the money. I wish I could send it back.",1
2775,"This Halo does it all: body scan, movement analysis, recommend exercises to improve movement, sleep tracking, syncing steps to Weight Watchers and more. I've recommended it to friends who don't already have fitness trackers.",5
2776,"Bought this product because I didn't want a full smart watch. It worked for about a week and then stopped syncing with my phone. I did all the trouble shooting advice, event re-set the band to factory. That got it to sync with my phone for a day then it stopped syncing. Amazon sent me a replacement which also stopped syncing in a couple of days.It was really comfortable and I liked it when it worked but it stopped working so quickly I probably won't try one of these again until 3 generations later as it seems they have a lot of problems.",1
2777,This product is amazing. I knew I wasn’t sleeping well but this helped me realize how bad my sleep patterns were. My physician is ordering a sleep study to get the full details in a clinical setting. The app is very user friendly and displays helpful information.,5
2778,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I was using the tracker for sleep as well as daily activity, the app has lots of features but the sleep mode isn’t reliable at all I’ve tried other sleep apps that are much better. I thought having a small faceless band would be less distracting but I e had my halo for about a month now and I’m ready to get rid of it.Update this device simply doesn’t work they have a lot of problems to solve to get this right. I just canceled my subscription it isn’t worth the problem",1
2779,I liked the way it fit and the way it looked. I even think it tracked my sleep well.  But getting it to sync is impossible. It says double press the button on the band but it never syncs. I am going to return it and just stick with only my Apple Watch.,2
2780,"great product fir the most part.  as a parent getting up with a toddler and infant, it gets my sleep wrong every once in awhile, logging it as sedentary time.  customer support has been a hassle and a half.  you get transferred a minimum of 4 times each time you call or chat.  no clear instructions on how to move to a new phone and retain info...3 stars fir now, I hope it improves",2
2781,I bought the Halo band in August and it's been great. The app is helpful and all of the integrated features work very well.,5
2782,I really like the app. Easy to use and has an amazing amount of resources,5
2783,The Halo its self I loved.  I loved all the videos and dash board that had your activity points. I love the sleep tracker and the different videos and the Apptiv for outdoor walks and runs.  I had 2 bands both broke the same way.  Because it says that the device is water resistant the first one I wore in the pool.  The plastic piece that covered the sensor came off with in 2 months.  I got it replaced with a new one and I have babied that one.  It did not get wet and it only lasted 5 months.  The same thing happened the plastic cover over the sensor came off with a gummy little gasket that fell out and disintegrated.  So I am done with the HALO it makes me sad because I really enjoyed it.,1
2784,Hated the wrist band. Can get dirty and no way to clean,1
2785,"- and it was a waste of my money.I’ve been very satisfied with most other Amazon purchases, but not this.I do generally research prior to buying, and wish I had done so with this.  But my Fit Bit had started having some issues, so when I saw this on sale at an Amazon affiliated site, I bought it quickly.I don’t normally use most of the Fit Bit features - but the Halo does not really have anything I can use.The sleep tracker was way off.The step tracker was not accurate.I used it for a week.And then ordered a new Fit Bit.Sorry Amazon - I think this product needs much more research.",1
2786,"this is the most invasive fitness tracker ever, it tracks the tone of your voice and to scan your body fat they have you take a picture of yourself in your undergarments",5
2787,"After 1.5yrs both Halos we purchased have died. They are supposed to be water proof? Both bands died after exposure to either sweat or water from swimming. I am not replacing them, this is not worth the aggravation and poor quality products. I hope people stop buying these, they dont last long at all.",1
2788,"I use the activity and sleep function. The body and voice are not of interest to me. The activity and sleep analysis is practically worthless, so not worth the cost. If you're looking for something simple to track activity time and sleep/wake time then it is okay. But not really worth the annual fee for that. You're better off buying a sleep monitor if you really have sleep problems. And better off buying a fitness band if you want to track fitness. Amazon may have rolled out this product too soon with too little value. Interesting potential but it isn't there yet. Body imagery is also interesting but the scale tells me what I need to know. And voice would be interesting if I were still in public speaking, but don't have a need for it in day to day conversation; and it drains the battery. Hence, not worth the annual cost. When it renews, I'll probably recycle it.",1
2789,I haven't set up the voice function so I can't review that.  The device and app set up was very easy and I am enjoying the sleep data.,5
2790,I like discreet look. Got tired of working about  how well I slept -lol.,3
2791,"I really like the band and the membership features (tips, labs and workouts) are great.Sorry to say after less than a month of usage, the band is no longer charging. Either the charger or the band itself, not really sure but it’s disappointing to say the least.",5
2792,"I was excited to purchase for my daughter to help her achieve her fitness goals, but less than a week after wearing the metal attachment fell off the band while she was walking. It took some time, but she found it and snapped it back in place. The app only seems to work in the U.S as we live outside the U.S, this proves to be less than a benefit. I don't think this was worth the hype.",2
2793,"Although I can still track everything on the app, the notifications have failed, the lights quit, and I'm pretty sure the button on the side does absolutely nothing. I'll probably wear it until the app charge kicks in or I find something else.",2
2794,"Decent fitness tracker, but if you aren't willing to pay up for the monthly membership it becomes an absolutely worthless bracelet that hides almost every statistic behind a paywall. It still tracks all sorts of info about you, it just doesn't let you know what it knows about you unless you pay them... Pathetic money grab (and data grab) from Amazon.",2
2795,Complicated and not accurate,3
2796,"I like that this is waterproof and that it doesn't have a screen.  But that puts ALL the data, and focus, on the app.  The app just isn't fully ready.  It is buggy, works - sort of, and has problems frequently.Maybe Amazon will, eventually, fix the app, maybe they won't.  Right now I am locked out of the app and customer service is telling me dumb stuff that actually makes the problem worse.",2
2797,"I loved the batter life on the halo. However, after charging it only a handful of times the charger broke. I tried it in multiple outlets and it is faulty. So dissapointing….",1
2798,"Nice idea, but it was bulky and uncomfortable to wear.  The app is ok.",3
2799,"Needs to be charged every day, which is really annoying but otherwise it’s been pretty good.",3
2800,Just stopped charging after about a month of having the halo band. I didn't want the trouble to order another one. Just thought that it was going to be easy just to replace it but that is not the case. So I just returned it.,2
2801,"This is a great device if you're looking for a simple, no frills band that does a pretty good job tracking activity and sleep but there is one fatal flaw for this product: the charger. My first band would not charge after 3 months so I contacted support. I was surprised to find that there was something like a 5 minute warranty on this thing. Apparently they knew it was a flawed design too. Well, the rep was ""nice"" enough to give me a one time courtesy replacement. That was back in July. Guess who's band won't charge again as of Christmas morning? So disappointed. I love this band but it is just junk when it comes to the charging set up. Avoid it at all costs.",1
2802,"Waste of my money and more importantly my time. Loved this tracker until the charging clip stopped charging. It quit quite suddenly. I was able to get credit from Amazon to order a new charging clip. Guess what? That won't charge the tracker either! So is it the band? After spending a bunch of time trying all the ""troubleshooting"" tips, all I have is a dead band because the battery is now drained and the charging clip won't charge.  I am not new to technology, I own a lot of smart home devices, including Amazon priducts, so I can usually work through issues.. I have worn Fitbit trackers for years (still do).  Wish I would have spent the money on a newer Fitbit rather on the Halo which lasted only 4 months. By the way, I didn't ever use the tone function or get the band wet...",1
2803,Inaccurate device. Sleep analysis was way off. Pedometer sometimes showed 500+ steps when I woke up. Difficult to charge. Would freeze often forcing factory reset causing it to lose data for the day. Stopped working altogether after around 6 months. I feel it is completely useless and would not recommend it to anyone.,2
2804,"I forget it's even there, but it looks so sleek and feels so comfortable",5
2805,The battery life sucks. Buy a cheaper tracker.,3
2806,I like all the data that it tracks.  Very informative.  It does have to be charged every 2 days which is kind of a pain.  I like everything except it does not have a watch.  I liked that part of my Garmin.,5
2807,Enjoying the Halo band! Features measuring activity plus sleep provide good insight. Function of tone and labs have not been utilized at all yet. Really thrilled about the community of Halo users along with Amazon's Halo Team focus on making the band the best health focused one in the market.,5
2808,Got it for my fiance and he loves it for a person who doesn't wear watches.  When i tried to buy me one the price went up.  Hopefully it comes back down.,5
2809,I am very impressed with this device and it’s accuracy.Keeps a long chargeOverallA great purchase.,5
2810,Product works as described. Returning as it's a little to complicated for my speed,3
2811,I tried wearing it.  Loved that it had all the features.  Used and I felt a little weird in my pinky and ring finger.  Not sure what it was from... so I continued wearing it and it got a bit worse... took the band off.... got better in a day.  I decided to try again... about a month later...same thing... so I am attributed it to the watch.  Everyone is different tho,2
2812,Great produce. Simple interface on the app. Body scan was as accurate as 3 inBody scans I’ve had in the past. I enjoy the sleep tracking and the point system.Tone analysis however kind of weird is very interesting.would be 5 stars if it connected with myfitnesspal,5
2813,Loving my Halo! It motivates me to get up and get my weekly points in daily. I 've lost 8 lbs since. My original braclet was pink and got dirty very soon so I bought a darker band so that I can always have one when washing the other.,5
2814,"I've had this for little over a month and have noticed this rash develop under where main unit is. I don't know if it's the sensor that is causing it, but I have never had a problem like this with a watch or anything else on my wrist. Hopefully it doesn't get infected. I wear it normally (not too tight, not too loose) and this is what happened so be careful.",2
2815,"This device has been a disappointment from the beginning.After a year, I am told it will not sync with my phone unless I submit to paying a monthly fee.No return was available after 30 days.For those who want to give Jeff all they have this is the device for you!I only wish I could vote for negative stars!Update:  I was contacted by a very nice person from Amazon who said I had been misinformed and was not required to pay a monthly fee.  Also, since I was within a year they would replace the Halo device.  I received a refurbished device which appears to be  working better than the original, and Amazon paid for me return shipping.",1
2816,"I love this product tells me my fat percentage and and how active I am.. that was the whole reason I was interested in it., it's a little guide to help me stay fit.. it also comes with this other programs and tips to help you with your healthy lifestyle...",5
2817,I expected much more for as late in the game as they were.  Does very basic monitoring.  Voice monitoring kills the battery way too fast and is not accurate in the slightest.  Mostly a bunch of apps for the phone.  Nothing new and exciting whatsoever.  It's sitting in a drawer and I bought a Galaxy Active 2.  Gave it 2 stars because I felt sorry for Bezos.,2
2818,The sleep tracking data is wildly inaccurateUpdate Oct 2021After just over 11 months the band which was already inaccurate at times has had it adhesive around the sensor fall off and now randomly turns off throughout the day. I would not recommend this or the new iteration with a screen unless they begin to offer some better warranty service,2
2819,"Not worth the purchase. I got it on early release and wish I could return it. It does everything any other fitness tracker does and the added features they advertise are no reason to go for this instead of the competitors. Doesn’t have any sort of screen which turned out to be more annoying than I thought. The only thing I will say I liked is the weekly point goals, made me more motivated, but still not worth it.",2
2820,"So I had whoop for a year before this and switched over because its cheaper price. Functions aside, Halo and my wrist really smells like poop after wearing it for a while. I had no problem with Whoop whatsoever about the smell but Halo stinks up my whole left forearm. This is not a joke post. I don't know if its the material difference or the design but they need to fix the problem.",2
2821,"I do really like this device. I think the sleep tracking is insightful. I don’t think it’s as sleek as a lot of other trackers out there. It also wore on my wrist weird as in my wrist was rubbed raw. It also had a hard time reading my HR if the device wasn’t placed directly on my wrist.update: This device stopped working after 6 weeks, just outside of the return window.",2
2822,I like the sleep reacting and the activity tracking. However the tracking accuracy is disappointing. If the halo is not perfectly placed in your wrist it does not  register your activity.  Trying to find the perfect placement is a mystery. Further research on this aspect is needed.,5
2823,"I really enjoy that the mobile app shows the data collected in a understandable and interactive manner with sleep tracking. The app is still being improved upon and updated, so I can see myself using this product for a very long time.",5
2824,"Very disappointing. It doesn't seem to do anything correctly. My sleep score is always horrible but other fitness trackers give results about 70 to 75 whereas Halo gives you something between 20 and 40. I walked over 7 miles and it says that I only have about 1500 steps, which is impossible. Not sure that I believe the body fat tracker either. Very disappointing.",2
2825,"I purchased the Halo to help me with sleep. When you set up reminders, it doesn't always remind. Whether it's the exercise or sleep app activities, you may have done the activities but its not recorded.  Battery life is horrible. You have to charge every day. The mindfulness apps are the same as all other free apps. I was hoping for continuous improvements but so far, it's been a dud.",2
2826,"On paper this sounds like a game changer in wearable fitness tech. This device is not intended for anyone with an athletic background , it is even worse for bodybuilding. Insane how such a large company can make such an abysmal device. I purchased it with the hopes of it being the new best thing. Unfinished product. Lackluster UI , not even remotely accurate for body fat scanning. Sitting at 14-16% bf @235 , 6’4 . Device says 27% bf . 3-4star scales outperform this device. I would love to test this product sometime in the future when it’s ready for the market. Don’t fall for the money grab. Will be returning it and purchasing Fitbit. This product is the new joke in fitness communities. Don’t believe the blogs , give it enough time and the unpaid reviewers will start ripping it apart. Amazon needs to stick to what it’s best at , 2 day shipping :) .",1
2827,"I so wanted to like this band, I really really did. Fact is though, it's mediocre and lackluster in comparison to others at this price point. The sleep tracking is a nice enough feature and the stats seem to be accurate. However, none of that matters, because THIS THING BURNED ME. I have a noticeable red blob on my wrist after having worn it for a couple weeks. It seems to be right where the BPM monitor is (I'm not sure if that's what did it). My skin isn't normally super sensitive and I have tried other bands in the past without something like this happening.  Needless to say I'm very disappointed and will be attempting to return this band.**UPDATE**Almost immediately after posting this, Amazon contacted me and is diligently working to find out what happened. I'm very impressed with their initiative to rectify this problem so that it doesn't happen to anyone else.",1
2828,Really like the fit and the feel of the Halo. It works very well and connects quickly. Definitely does was it supposed to do. Definitely a great buy.,5
2829,"Questionable sleep tracking but at least it gave you some details. All of a sudden they started billing $5/month. When I canceled, virtually all usable info went away. Unless you're willing to pay a monthly fee, not sure it's of any use.",2
2830,"There are components I really like, but it’s not enough to keep for a monthly charge. I like the simplicity but it’s almost too simplified. The charger is an absolute nightmare. I do thoroughly enjoy the app and have seen an improvement in my health.  Fingers crossed Amazon takes the feedback and has a better version shortly.",2
2831,"I looooove this, it’s nice to keep track of how active I am and how much sleep I’m getting. It’s super light weight and I barely notice it’s there. I keep it on as I’m grappling and so far it has not hindered my exercise at all",5
2832,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 This is the unboxing of the Amazon Halo.",4
2833,I love my halo.iuse it mostly for my sleep.paterns. it is so helpful  to see how much time I sleep and don't sleep. The chart data is amazing. Highly recommend. My husband also has one and really likes it.,5
2834,better systems available for much less,3
2835,"I have an Apple Watch already and was looking forward to advanced sleep analytics and the body scanning feature.Both disappointed. The body scan feature was very off compared to the body scanning system at the gym. The sleep feature also wasn't very helpful. I guess I was expecting something similar to Whoop, but it seemed very elementary.",2
2836,This thing is absolute trash. It never correctly reads your heart rate. I'll be doing crossfit and it just says 70bpm. I check with another 10 dollar heart monitor and it's 160.The voice analysis is a joke. It can't determine if I'm listening to music in the car. It has all kind of mood phrases after a drive and I haven't said a word.An also WHY HAVE A TEMPERATURE SENSOR THAT YOU CANT SEE THE TEMPERATURE! idiot designer. Especially with Covid wouldn't it be cool if you could glance at the app and check temp? Nah Amazon didn't think about that. The sensor is only for sleep but not always and it has never displayed my sleep temp after a whole week.It just sucks. It's hugely awkward to sleep with and way oversized for the retarded amount of features. Fail,1
2837,The biggest reasons were to track my steps and sleep for my purchasing. I could never get the band to accurately track even after trying a new band. Great idea but Whoop seems to be a better brand that I’m looking into.,2
2838,I really wanted to like it. It has lots of great features but the fact that I have to always have to have my phone handy to check anything is what makes me not like it.  It doesn't provide motivational alerts.  Having a screen would have been great.  I switched to a different device.,2
2839,Stopped working after a month exchanged it going to give it another chance,3
2840,"Really wanted to like this, especially with the sleep tracking and heartrate monitoring throughout the day. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way to wear it that didn't become unbearable after a few hours. I haven't been cinching it down tight or anything, but it leaves a mark on my arm which can get really sore after wearing it overnight. I hope other people have better luck with the fit, but it makes it unusable for me.",2
2841,"Very small and comfortable to wear. I'm also a fan of the available programs to help w your health instead of just tracking. Body scan feature is mildly disappointing, but it could be because I have a unique body shape. So far, very happy with this product",5
2842,Very easy to track progress. I really enjoy sleep tracking.,5
2843,I love this thing! It has helped me to lose weight. I don’t use the tone function. I love that it tracks my activity without me having to tell it I’m going for a walk. Excellent device!,5
2844,"I have been using it for a month now along with my iWatch. Both have their own pro and cons. iwatch I use for notifications, while halo band give me useful information on my health. I love tone analysis and intensity of activity. I have not tried body fat.",5
2845,"I got on the waitlist as soon as I heard about this watch. I have an Apple Watch but i wanted something I could wear comfortably while I sleep. I also wanted to use the BMI function.This watch is a NIGHTMARE to charge. I’ve read several reviews about the horrible charging design and I agree 100%. I can NEVER get this to charge on the first try. Most of the time I will try for a few minutes and get frustrated and put it down and come back to it later and try again. This time around I had been trying for 3 days to charge this dead watch and it wouldn’t charge. After unplugging, plugging, trying different USB’s for over an hour today it is finally charging. If I have to keep going thru this much hassle just to charge this watch I am DONE. I would mot buy this again or recommend it.",1
2846,"Not comfortable, and the accuracy is way off.  Love the scan tho",3
2847,Can't log in to my account to start my halo. Need help!!!!!!!,1
2848,"I've enjoyed my Halo greatly, the only bad comment I have is that the pink wrist band has been very hard for me to clean.  I would like an easier to clean wrist band or an option to purchase just a wristband to replace the dirty one.",5
2849,"This watch fit great, was easy to work with and has great tools to track  my sleep patterns,  steps and density.  I am pretty impressed.",5
2850,"I loved all the features in this device. It actually shares a lot of good information. When I bought it it had all the features enabled, as part of the trial period. I understood must of the cool stuff is available only with a membership fee and I was ok with it. I just received an email from Amazon saying that my subscription couldn't be renewed since my credit card is from out of US. Now I have a very expensive step counter with very limited functionality. I don't understand what is the reason behind not allowing me to pay my membership with an international credit card since I don't live in US anymore. Without the membership, this is a very expensive device that does nothing.",1
2851,Great sleep and fitness wearable.,5
2852,"I really love a few things about this: the look, no screen, the point system.However. This band cannot count steps consistently at all. Really frustrating when you're trying to hit your step goal and go on an hour walk and it only tracks 200 steps.Likely going to ditch this for a uglier fitness tracker.",2
2853,"I applaud the concept of the Halo and really like it how it looks, but the problem is when you have a device that is centered around data collection— that is all the Halo does— it needs to be accurate, like say at least 95% of the time. And the Halo does not achieve nearly that. I will be at the gym going at my max heart rate around 170-180 BPM as my measured by a more sophisticated device and Halo will be registering it as less than 100. And then the next day at the gym it will suddenly figure things out and register the correct BPM. I’ve seen this happen over several months. So in short—the data is crap. In all I’ve had the Halo for about 8 months so I feel like I’ve given it a pretty fair shakedown. Wish I could return it.",1
2854,"Had the band for few weeks now. Worked well for about 4 weeks and since then the app doesn’t connect to the band to access data... not what I expectedAdding more info to help Amazon and other buyers- I can see the live heart bpm but can’t access steps, tone and other activity data on the app. I keep seeing message”can’t update info” and “double press band button to sync”",2
2855,I liked how it looked and all of the tracking it provided. The reason for the low rating is it stopped working after 6 months with no way to contact Amazon because the product support ended.,2
2856,Liked product but stopped charging,3
2857,"FYI I bought this mainly for tone analysis feature. I feel like tone analysis on a wristwatch just seems inappropriate if you don't speak relatively loud all day. Something that would work better with ear buds or a headset and not something that sits on your wrist. Also, it will not tell you anything you don't already know about how you sound unless you are absolutely oblivious. Everything else is neat. The self help articles, etc.",2
2858,"The Amazon Halo does a great job of sleep tracking and counting steps, when it's working.  I was happy with my purchase until ~1 month of use it just stopped charging.  The light on the side would no longer turn on to indicate charging.  Amazon tech and I troubleshot but they ended up sending me a replacement.  The replacement worked great for ~1 month.  Again, my Halo has stopped charging.  The light on the side indicating charging will not turn on.  Since having both of these fail I researched online and there are MANY people having this same issue.  There is obviously a manufactures defect.  Unfortunately I purchased my unit at a retailer and neither Amazon or the retailer will refund the unit.  Be very careful purchasing this Amazon Halo product.",1
2859,"I've been using this for about 3 months as part of a Hancock Vitality Life Insurance program which saves me money for having a healthy lifestyle.  I have found the Halo to be extremely inaccurate for sleep tracking and for activity tracking. I wear an Apple watch for sleep tracking and use a Garmin Edge for cycling, my main exercise, and the Halo readings are way off those excellent devices.For the cycling, it isn't capturing all the time I'm active and isn't close on the heart rate levels recorded, way underestimating actual heart rate and intense activity. I know my Garmin is accurate as I've used it for years and have had similar devices before that.And I've tried making the band tighter and looser to see if that makes a difference--it doesn't.  I guess you get what you pay for in this device.",1
2860,Not impressed. The battery life is terrible. I don't like that I can't turn off the tone. I only really use it for sleep. I can't figure out how to see anything but a live heart rate. I'm not interested in taking a half nude photo of myself for amazon for the body fat thing. Should have looked into that feature a little more before making the purchase. I do not like it.,2
2861,"I mostly got this to monitor sleep, and it gives a good overview of sleep patterns.  I really like that it shows different levels of sleep as well as sleep disruptions.  I'm now exploring the other health functions it provides and especially appreciate the labs.",5
2862,"If you're new to fitness trackers, this will likely work for you. But if you're already using Fitbit or Garmin (I've used both over the last 8+ years) this is a reset. In my case,I started with Fitbit and switched to Garmin. In both cases, they both worked with MyFitnessPal. With all the data on all those other platforms, I can't switch to Halo when it doesn't integrate with that platform, and doesn't have a 1 for 1 match on food/calorie tracking. To top it all off, charging $4/mo (almost $50/year) is a bit obscene.I suggest the product team dive deep, and look at what people with years of other fitness trackers are looking for. It feels like they weren't customer obsessed, and didn't interview existing users.",1
2863,Very lightweight. I forgot I have it on most of the time and I hate stuff on my wrists so I'm happy with that. The body fat measuring system is amazing also.,5
2864,"I really wanted to like this.But there is no way. I found the device disconnecting and not recording. Even performed a factory reset. The HR Monitor wasn’t really doing its job, this is what lead me to realize it wasn’t working right. If you shut your phone off the device has trouble recognizing the phone again.Great idea. Terrible execution.",1
2865,"The one feature that sold me on this was the 'Tone' analysis. It never works. The sleep pattern is only sometimes consistent with other devices I have that do the same thing. Every time I open the app, it has to re-sync.No problem with the footprint. It's lightweight and almost forget it's there. Don't really care for the included band.Cool idea. Pretty disappointing execution - mostly in the software/analytics.",2
2866,"I work nights and it does track when you sleep, however it seems that being up for 5 hours is a sleep disturbance. Also, it does not give the correct information for what my day is. My 24 hour activity is spread over 2 days (like Sunday night through Monday morning for me is Sunday for everyone who works when it is light outside). It affects my daily data. If there was a way that you could change the settings to what part of the day you are awake, that might be better. As it is right now, it is a cheap ""smart"" watch without a clock face.",1
2867,Benefits:1. Tracking daily activity with a point system is an incentive for meeting weekly goals.2. Accurate sleep tracking3. App offers lots of health adviceNegatives:1. Voice app requires charging device daily. Clever...but i do not use because of power drain.,5
2868,"Pros: Sleep monitor, Heart Rate monitor, Battery length (5-6 Days)Cons: Subscription Based service, Original fabric band frays and smells horrible, No wakeup alarm, Tone analysis is a gimmick, Body Scan is awkward to use, Charger isn’t reversible or wireless (You have to shimmy the band in it to make sure it’s seated properly)",2
2869,I really wanted to like this product. However within the first couple of months of having the band it stopped connecting with the app. Customer support issued me a refurbish band.  Within a month that band was intermittently working. Very frustrating when I was working out and it would stop reading my heart rate. Very frustrating with the sleep tracking word every night but about 50% of the time it would have no data in the morning. Contacted customer service and advised that I wanted a refund as this was the second band I tried. I had to pay a restocking fee to get a refund not sure why I have to pay a restocking fee on a product that doesn’t work as described.,1
2870,"I use this band for more than a month and comparing results with my Garmin Fenix 6x pro most of the results were not accurate  at all. The battery last only  for 3 days even that the device doesn't have any kind of display, and the charging time takes long.  I do not recommend waste on  time and money on this thing , it need much more time of development.",2
2871,I purchased this item and used for about 3 weeks before I noticed it wasn't syncing and started to notice it was not charging.  About a year has gone by and stopped working almost 2 months before I owned for a year.,2
2872,"I returned the Halo.  The device displays nothing.  All info is on the app.  I'm not one to constantly look at my phone.  I would prefer it display the time, steps and some other information llike I have on my Fitbit.  For me it is not a good alternative to what I already have.  I did find the voice feature intriguing to interpret my mood from my voice.",2
2873,"Product is okay, but needs drastic improvement in functionality and especially battery life.",3
2874,I followed the advice by changing outlets and cleaning the device where it charges.  It’s only gaining about 4% every hour now when it charges so I charge it overnight making the sleep tracking worthless,2
2875,I mainly needed this to track my sleep patterns and trying to figure out why I can't get good sleep.  It is really helping.,5
2876,"I have to get all my exercise in my house. I liked what this band was supposed to do, and it’s sleep tracking is very good.  However, my 1 mile walk on the treadmill was marked as sedentary.  Not worth the money unless you have sleeping issues",2
2877,"The device's sensors stopped working after less than a year of usage. However, since I had owned the Halo for over a year, it was out of warranty and that's that-- Amazon customer service would only give me a 15% discount on a purchase of a new Halo.When it did work, the sleep tracking functionality was surprisingly inaccurate. Liked some of the workouts in the app, but searching through them was a nuisance. Body fat percentage is just 3 photos you take with your phone then it gets analyzed in the app.",1
2878,"I liked the information the band provided. However, the first one I ordered stopped being charged a few months after purchase. The replacement I received developed the same problem after about four weeks! I had a lot of trouble trying to return it. I finally succeeded in getting the return approved. Don't buy it!",2
2879,I love having a new way to track my emotions and how my voice comes across to others.  Just have to almost speak as a squeaky mouse to get the app to recognize a happy tone.  Love the labs provided to help work through issues!,5
2880,"Great product, keeps me striving to push to my goals. Almost got to 900 in one week! Love this. Great for calorie tracking, lost 10 pounds with the help of this",5
2881,"The halo has a chance to be a great product, the tone voice analyzer gives you and opportunity to understand how you sound to other people. The downfalls for this product in my opinion are if you are going to wear it make it more useful adding a watch feature. Also it has a hard time synching(bluetooth) I've noticed, sometimes 3 or 4 tries are needed. Sometimes it doesn't register my sleep cycles. Update, 20 May 2021 the back bevel that is against your wrist fell apart, the silicone adhesive came off and the back bevel fell off. Wouldn't buy again until this issue is fixed. Will not purchase an Amazon product again, Halo didn't last a year and less than 6 months use and it fell apart and Amazon is charging me a restocking fee for the return on a broken product.",1
2882,"Worth the money! Worth the monthly membership. If you want to save money get this! Amazon gives recommendations on workouts, food recipes, meditation, etc.",5
2883,"I have had this for a couple of months now, and the lack of consistency is pathetic.  I have followed the instructions for placement of the band to alleviate any issues.  On some nights it tracks and other nights it does not.  I have wore my fitbit to compare the two.  When it does track the sleep, the results are very similar to the fitbit. Same issues with it tracking activity.  Sometimes it tracks and other times it does not.  It is good about letting me know when the battery is getting low and when it is fully charged.  Have not used the voice or bodyscan, so no opinion on those features.  The one feature that led me to the Halo was the lack of a face.  It is first generation, so hopefully the next one will be improved.",1
2884,"I’ve had this band a few months now and like it a lot, It’s comfortable to wear I forget I have it on sometimes too. This little device has really upped my work out game and keeps me on track.",5
2885,The voice analysis is fun but it drains the battery really fast.  I loved the sleep analysis until it stopped working.  The body composition I think would be nice except I don't have anyone I feel comfortable enough with to take my picture and don't know how to do it by myself.  I would love to see about getting my band repaired or replaced but haven't discovered yet who to contact.,2
2886,Not quite what I thought  Odd way of measuring activity,3
2887,"The sleep and activity tracking are really good. I used the body scan once. It seems fairly accurate. It is a little bulky, and could use some redesign to maybe make it a little more streamlined. The mobile app is user friendly.",5
2888,"This is definitely what I wanted, simple, low key, does not distract me at all. Very comfy to sleep. I highly recommend it to track your health, without all the clutter and notifications that most smart bands bring.",5
2889,Loved this device at first. Wore it as recommended and then noticed my skin was irritated. Always took it off to shower and dried thoroughly before putting it back on. The skin on my wrist become dry and red. Now it is peeling in that spot. Switched to the other wrist and same thing. Have never had this problem with other trackers I have had.,2
2890,Halo said I slept 2 hours but only slept 1.5,3
2891,I love the idea of the Halo...but I just found it to be lacking in features. I thought I would like to replace my Apple Watch at least for sleep...but I just didn’t get much from it. I’m not using it and am trying to give it away...most people do t want it because they use their Fitbit or Apple Watch and get more from them.,2
2892,"Love it! Great for tracking calories burned, track sleep and the points system challenges you to be more and more active. And much cheaper than a Garmin or Fitbit watch!",5
2893,"I love the fact that I now realize that I've lived off 3.5 - 4hrs of sleep for 4+ years, after the halo, that has changed dramatically.",5
2894,I barely was able to use the band before it stopped charging. The sleep tracking was useful during the free demo period and it fits very comfortably,2
2895,"I switched from Whoop to Halo after 6 months of using Whoop. I dropped whoop mainly because I didn't like Whoop's strategy for forcing me to extend 6 months to get the 4.0 tracker. However, after using both, I now understand how one fitness tracker can be better than another. Halo is simply not accurate and sometimes it doesn't even read the measurements. Also, doesn't have an HRV reading. Maybe it's hidden in the application but honestly even if it exists I wouldn't trust it due to the general inaccuracies I've been experiencing with Halo. Either will return it or exchange as I still have time but definitely not keeping this device... total joke",1
2896,"Sleep tracker is inaccurate. Love the fitness and heart rate tracker. Great for measuring my anxiety.IT LEFT A PERMANENT DENT IN MY WRIST! Photos are after not wearing it for a month or more. It’s worse when I wear it. Now I only use the app to track my fitness, I don’t wear the Halo.",2
2897,Sleep modo does not work...will only use it for heart rate.,3
2898,wish it had a watch encluded also doesn't count steps correctly,3
2899,"My husband is not a huge fan of this product. The battery is less than 24 hours and takes a about 2 or more hours to charge. There’s no face so it is entirely dependent upon the moble app for all of the information, which we knew but it is rather annoying. He rarely wears it because it just isn’t very user friendly. The tone seems off also. He has a very stern tone if voice and part if the reason I purchased this was so he can see how he speaks to their people. It says he sounds confused most of them time, which may be true lol, but when he is talking to people he’s pretty confident. Overall I tried to get him to allow me to return this but he’s still trying to like it and he’s had it for a few months.",1
2900,"I enjoyed it, but it seems that Amazon pulls your phone number into a new database when you login with the Halo app, and you can't change it. So when I lost my phone number due to circumstances outside of my control, I could no longer login to the Halo app because they needed to send me a code to allow me to login. Support can't change the number or even see it, just the one for your overall Amazon account (which doesn't help because it doesn't update your number with Halo). I cancelled my subscription and my order for the new band, they have been unable to assist and I am permanently locked out from Halo.",1
2901,I love my Halo.  The only thing I don't understand is why the first day of the week I get a ton of activity points and the rest of the week it is low while doing the same amount of activity.,5
2902,"I want to like this band...I have tried to like this band.  My biggest problem is connectivity issues.  I have several devices that easily stay connected so it is not a phone Bluetooth issue.  This is the one device that I am constantly having to force quit the app just to hope that it will sync, which it almost never does.  I have gone through the troubleshooting too many times to count.  I have also reset the band at least 3 times not to mention all the times I have restarted it.  Tonight I tried for over 30 minutes to get it to pair to my phone.  No luck.  I finally gave up and said forget it!  I amonly hoping that I can get the app past the “pair” page so that I can deregister this thing and be done with it.",1
2903,I dislike there is no screen to see real time data. The only benefit of not having a screen is while sleeping movement doesn’t activate a screen. Overall I prefer Fitbit.,2
2904,"Buyer beware.Right out of the box the item did not pair even after charging with full charge. Not made for mens wrist. Band felt cheap and barely fit my wrist. Upgraded band was $30??? Wow really.This POS is not worth my time, shame on you for putting your name on this.Going to buy a real fitness tracker... returned for refund",1
2905,"The sleep feature works well, tracks quality and quantity of sleep. The movement tracker works well. The step tracker tracks arm swings as steps, so that is inaccurate.",5
2906,the velcro band on this is poor quality.. In less than 1 year the velcro has disintegrated and needs to be replaced.,5
2907,unable to sync band to app. Have tried for over 24 hours - following all proposed solutions.  Very frustrating... Seemed to have some battery problem prior to issue with battery not fully charging even though in charging dock for hours.Did like the sleep feature and heart monitor. Not that keen on voice monitor which also seemed to drain battery rapidly.Overall  falls short of similar apps like fitbit.,2
2908,"UPDATE: comparing data from this tracker to another program that tracks sleep, this tracker is wildly inaccurate. I am retiring this unit and looking for another. I had really high hopes for this. I bought it to replace a tracker that just gave up. It does not allow you to connect to another app, such as apple health, which connects to my company’s tracker to earn health rewards. The battery life isn’t as good as it could be. I have to charge it every 3 days, my other tracker went 8 days without a charge. As sleek and cool as it looks, I miss the time function.  I don’t like the fact that I will have to start paying for the app every month, my other tracker’s app was free and had more available reports. I am already looking for a replacement as this just doesn’t meet my needs.",1
2909,Ot wasn't quite what I was expecting.  It looks great and the band is very comfortable and it is nice to have when you don't want people to know you wearing a heart rate monitor. However I don't think I can return it at this as it may be too late. But I would like to talk with someone to make sure I have it set up correctly.,2
2910,Sleep tracking,3
2911,I love this! I've had it for awhile and it really motivates me to get up and move. The Tone feature makes me think about my mood and how I respond to people. I love the labs. They are definitely motivating. I definitely recommend!,5
2912,"In less than 8 months I’ve gone through 4 replacements and ended up paying for two bands because usps/Amazon miraculously lost return package in hub city (lucky Amazon, yay!) I also had to pay to return last replacement.The band only lasts maybe 48 hrs before having to be recharged and sometimes it’ll just be dead and you won’t realize for a good length of time.I want to like this band but there’s a lot of small issues the end up making band not worth having. I no longer use the one band I even have left. Don’t bother buying this product. Save your money and stress.",1
2913,I have been using it for a moment now. Seems to be good. Have gotten it wet (still works) stays charged for the most 2 days ive seen so far. Cant talk to it or see time. Everything is thru app only.,5
2914,I was unable to download the halo app to my phone.,3
2915,I can see why the tone feature can be taken offensively though personally it does help me reflect on my mood especially when I might be short tempered with my kids. It's not a bad thing if you use it the way it is intended.,5
2916,"Have been wearing constant other than in shower. Love this device, especially the Tone feature!  App is great, look at it multiple times a day, and also user friendly.",5
2917,I am completely disappointed in this tracker.  The app got worse and worse over time and the charger is near impossible to get it to connect to the tracker.It's been less than a year and the battery is completely dead.Very disappointed and no way to get support for it.,2
2918,I really have enjoyed this tracker and the apps within the app. To help you exercise and help with mental relaxation. I only wish it came with a silicone sport band. The clothe band isn’t bad and I’ve zero issues just a preference thing.,5
2919,"I purchased my Halo band and charger June of 2021, and now, January 2022, my charger does not work.  Does not make me happy.",2
2920,I wanted to try this item as I usually like Amazon products. I think this item might have potential in the future but as of now no. I returned my halo due to it stoped charging and will look up other options with my refund. Happy hunting,2
2921,I absolutely loved my Halo band and all the features the app had. I'm very disappointed now because it stopped charging and I've always been extremely careful with it. I doubt I'll buy another one because of this.,2
2922,"I never thought I would like so much data about my habits.  However, the Halo band equips me with knowledge to render better, / healthier choices.",5
2923,"Easy, simple setup.",4
2924,Marathon runners will like it because you can’t break it by sweating too much. Fitbit broke several times due to moisture,5
2925,"Used a Christmas gift card and was hoping for a better product. After using for two months, very sketchy data. Doesn’t record exercise accurately, now taking 8-12 hours to charge ( was taking one hour originally) and the voice recognition is a joke. I have an old Apple Watch and thought this might be a good alternative. Don’t waste your money.",2
2926,"This was so comfortable to wear. You didn’t even know you had it on. I was able to sleep with it and it didn’t bother me at all. Having said that I had to return it because all the other features did not work correctly for me. I wore my Fitbit watch for 3 straight nights and the readings that I got from the sleep app was WAY OFF!!. The HEART RATE again was WAY OFF. I did the body scan 3 times in a row just to see if it would give the same reading and it DID NOT. The first reading I got was 24.9%, second was 25.3% and third was 23.2% this was all in a matter of minutes not days but minutes. I really wanted this to work because it is VERY COMFORTABLE to wear thats the reason for the 1 Star review. Oh well. :\",1
2927,I love this product. Like seriously love!. Its worth the money and the subscription rate is low. If you can afford any streaming service tben you can afford this too,5
2928,"I had high hopes, but this is not ready for prime time yet.Pros:  interesting tracking, including tone of voice and body scanCons:  bulky, uncomfortable to wear, hard to put on and take off, sleep tracking seems wildly inaccurate and rates terrible nights of sleep as ""good"", the tone of voice categorization is difficult to believe, battery life isn't great  Monthly fee???  Hahaha.",2
2929,"So, I bought this at launch. (Also, I tried to get help or a replacement with no resolution)The band does track your steps and activity fairly well. The band never tracked my sleep after wearing it anytime I was breathing besides the shower. Now it doesn't charge at all. The red light turns on like it's charging but it will sit there all day and stay red. Very disappointed in the $71 I flushed for a wristband that does nothing. Thanks for the support Amazon. My garmin vivoactiveHR still works perfectly after almost 10 years, but I keep it connected to my bike and wanted something slimmer for running and work. This isn't the solution. Maybe I can get a credit or something eventually. All the best",1
2930,"I was very excited to try out the Halo, but it falls shorts of my expectations. The app is nice and relatively user-friendly, but the accuracy of the tracking is very much off. I haven't really been able to get the benefit from it I expected. I was going to order a 2nd one for my son, but decided to give him mine instead since I don't plan to use it. .",2
2931,"I mainly use it for activity and sleep tracking. The additional labs are super informative and interesting. I haven't started the body tracking yet but soon. I haven't had a fitness tracker before, so for me, this is perfect! Thanks Amazon!",5
2932,"I was very excited when I saw what this band had to offer. So I immediately bought one. I loved the interface on the app and enjoyed that it was pretty simple.The issue is with the hardware itself. I ordered the band and after using it for a month, it refused to connect to my phone. I reset it and followed all the troubleshooting steps, but nothing worked. I ordered a replacement (this was easy. Good customer service!) and it arrived on Feb 3,2021. One month later, this band refuses to connect to my phone. The light blinks, but it’s a no go. Worst of all, the return is not possible anymore. So I’m stuck with a faulty product.My recommendation is that you just pay the extra cash, if you can, and buy a better product. This one just doesn’t last.",1
2933,I am not loving this product. I've given it several months and it has not lived up to my expectations. Battery life is poor. Currently been having issues with it syncing. Sleep and voice recognition are so so. Miss my fitbit. Will be going back to it. Don't have to pay a subscription fee for fitbit or samsung.,2
2934,I loved the Halo !! The product was amazing while it worked I lost almost 55 pounds and the body scans were great motivation. Then one day the Halo stopped charging .. I owned two different chargers both of which won’t charge the halo. I have also plugged it into different outlets. The product service window has closed. So I am hoping that someone from Amazon might be able to help me because I am still paying for the monthly subscription. I would hate to think I am going to be replacing the Halo almost once a year due to battery issues.,1
2935,Easy APP and really good offering of activities. Love the sleep analysis. Like that it’s not so noticeable since there is no “face” - just a band. Adjustable fit and doesn’t feel heavy or thick. It’s my favorite tracker if the ones I’ve tried.,5
2936,Needs to be better. Hopefully Amazon keeps updating it.,3
2937,charging device is horrible and takes multiole attempts to clip in correctly.doesn't integrate with Google fit or other tracking.voice monitoring doesn't seem accurate at or or useful in any way.body scan seems useful but a hassle to set up right. need a scale in conjunction too.sleep tracking seemed accurate. steps seemed high.overall not useful and looking for something that integrates with google fit tracking.,2
2938,"I was anxious to try out the device, but, within 4-6 hours had a dermatitis form under the band.  I suspect I am allergic to some of the content in the band and Amazon did not respond when I asked if there were other alternatives.  Thus, I am unable to rate the performance that other can.I did like that it was light and the band was not wide.",2
2939,"I love the comprehensive health information I get from Halo, plus tons of resources from workouts to meditation. I’m obsessed with  using my stats, like, sleep tracking, to improve over time. I love the look of the band, it’s comfortable and sleek.",5
2940,"Don't  waste your money on the Halo. It is worthless. The way it tracks sleep is absurd. It takes me less that 5 minutes to fall asleep and it always indicates it takes me 25 or more minutes to fall asleep. The time in bed seems accurate but the time asleep is not even close. The tracking of REM, Light and Deep is also not worth even noting. Same with points. It is terrible. Tone is the most ridiculous feature on the HALO. Who needs it? Unless you are a speaker perhaps and even then  it is totally inaccurate. It also disconnects very often and you have to re-sync it which isn't difficult. Compared to a FITBIT the HALO is a big fat ZERO. Buy a FITBIT and be done with it. Oh, on a positive note the Halo does seem to track your heart's bpm. fairly accurately.",1
2941,I love this fitness tracker! The discover series offers great programs. I do a daily meditation and even tried a walk/jog program today! Definitely helps keep me motivated.,5
2942,"I love my Amazon Halo Band. So far no problems, accurate, comfortable. Only need to charge about once a week (I don't have tone on). Enjoy mine so much bought one for daughter for Christmas and she loves hers too!",5
2943,"i was chosen to be part of the early access and be a trial person. let me just start by saying that mine was never able to be set up. when i opened the box and downloaded the app, it said the band needed to be updated and would take less than 10 minutes. it has never “updated” and i have never been able to use it. my app is stuck on the updating screen and the band itself of course has no use because it shows no info on the band itself at all. so i paid $70 for nothing, but at least it was a lower price for the early access. would not recommend at all. i was really hoping this would be great and i could get one for my husband whose apple watch broke recently and he’s been wanting something new. definitely not getting him this disappointment.",1
2944,"In love with my Halo!!!  From its beautiful design to its awesome features.... all interactive, all relevant to my journey.  The scan is ....is.... umph! You just gotta try it for yourself!  You won’t be disappointed!",5
2945,Love the Halo I keep moving with it and try to beat the day before. I especially like the sleep feature. as I am trying to continuously improve my sleep,5
2946,I like that I don't have to fumble with buttons on the device to see what is going on. The app is nice but I have questions about the sleep tracker and activity tracker but don't know how to pursue my quesions.,5
2947,I have really enjoyed the easy of monitoring my sleep and body composition.  The activity portion was a reality check as it deduced points for nonmovement is a period of time.  Made me aware of how much I was watching television.,5
2948,After few weeks it quit working...returned!,1
2949,Updated: Emery with Amazon customer service was fantastic and was able to address all my issues. He took feedback well and apologized for the trouble I was having. Back to using my Halo Band!,5
2950,I have had my halo for almost 6 months and have pretty much loved it up to this point. Last week I received notice that I was going to have to start paying for the service which I was not aware of. This could be my fault and I just didn't remember reading that but whatever. The thing I can't deal with is the fact it burned me yesterday. Now what??? I can't wear it anymore because I don't want to be burned again and it is too late for a refund.,1
2951,"While this fitness tracker does have a couple of neat features like sleep tracking and body composition photos to track progresss, its not worth it.  The $4 per month fee made me not use it anymore and if you don't want to pay the monthly fee the device is nearly useless because amazon cripples the useful features.  The monthly membership fee coupled with ZERO/NO display and low battery life makes this device a HARD PASS.  Look elsewhere and don't get sucked into another monthly fee.",1
2952,It got warm on my wrist but it was pretty awesome!,3
2953,"Easy to use, probably accurate, but I have no way of knowing. My wife is happy with it so I am happy. I won't be happy if I have to start paying a monthly fee, which I think I read somewhere.",5
2954,The only reason I got this was to do the active heart rate workouts in my new ifit treadmill. I says in the description that it works with them. No one actually tried connecting them in testing department? The app is waiting for the treadmill to prompt the user to accept pairing. But the treadmill isn't capable of that. It either connects or doesn't. So the treadmill sits there trying to connect and the Halo app is waiting for a accept pairing that will never come. I will be returning the band and I guess just getting the ifit brand monitor.,1
2955,Halo is excellent for sleep tracking and is very accurate!  I have sleep apnea and wear a mask at night...Halo picks up even the slightest sleep disturbances more so than my machine which allows me to report and show my doctor.,5
2956,"Really comfortable. Needs more features to keep up with the competition - Sp02, HRV, respiration rate etc. wish it would tell me how much sleep I need. But overall it's pretty slick - small enough that I don't feel it when I'm sleeping.",5
2957,I like the look of this band but the sleep tracking and body fat measurements are off. I can take two measurements back to back and get different readings. Sometimes it takes me awhile to get to sleep and the sleep tracker will say it took one minute. Not sure I could buy this again at this point.,2
2958,"This device is wildly inaccurate. The body scanning fat percent calculator is so bad even though it claims to be “twice” as accurate as competing home scanners. I lost 5 pounds through diet and exercise, and it said that my body fat % went UP from healthy to borderline obese. (My BMI is 20, so saying that I’m >20% body fat is absolutely insane). I’ve measured my body fat on many different devices and none of them have said I’m above 16%.Don’t get me started on the sleep tracker. I use an EEG as well (the most accurate tracker you can get) to baseline and compare performance, and this device is SO much less accurate than the phone-based apps that sit on your nightstand. How can that be??The ONLY thing this device is good for is the conversation sentiment tracking. That seems to work pretty well.",1
2959,Battery life is good unless you use the tone,3
2960,"There's still some kinks to be worked out. Sometimes it says I've gone to bed later than I did, or woke up much later than I did.  The battery isn't the greatest! But overall LOVE this and wear it daily!",5
2961,My over all experience is great however I have a problem now the strip in the back came off and it won't stay on.  How do I fix this problem.,5
2962,My halo band has stopped charging after 5 months.,1
2963,"I was disappointed in the app experience – they are going to have to do better to get me to pay 4 bucks a month for it.  The point system seems all over the board, and the tone analysis capabilities are not worth the loss of battery life.",2
2964,"Purchased band during early invitation program. Less than 6 months, band is already damaged (interferes with sleep and heart rate monitor) and does not qualify for replacement.Band has potential if it had been built with better material. Band was not exposed to extreme conditions, or poor use. I would not recommend this product based on short lifespan.",2
2965,"The sleep tracking is amazing. It makes me more cautious of how I'm sleeping so I think it makes me sleep better. Sometimes I feel like the app doesn't track everything for movement. Overall,  I love my Amazon Halo!",5
2966,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I’m keeping track track of my sleep, my steps, how active I am, how I talk to people. It’s great. I would truly recommend it to others.",5
2967,"My primary interest in the Halo band was to get feedback on my sleep. The data is weird. Like last night I went to bed at 10:30 pm. When I actually fell asleep is data that I was hoping to learn from this device. Instead the report in the morning started at 12:02 am. What happened to the previous 90 minutes? Similarly with Activity. I'm a seasoned and regular exerciser. I know what to do to raise my heart rate and put in a decent cardio workout. Yet the Halo rates me ""light"". Not helpful. I will keep trying this out for a few more days but likely I will return the item.",1
2968,"I love everything about it. Very comfortable, stylish, and accurate! The app is easy to use, and has great content. A life changer! I see a lot of negative comments about charging. For me, it's been super easy. The clip works wonderfully.",5
2969,"I purchased the halo being skeptical at first but then I got to see the app.features and it gives a full detail of your sleeping pattern. Steps, voice and BMI. It is helping me keep on track.",5
2970,Nice to see not only my heart rate but how many calories I burn as well. Nice motivation for an old lady.,5
2971,"This device does not do what they claim.  The sleep function was interesting until I found out it doesn’t track movements unless over a few minutes. Additionally, when the app updates it loses sync with your phone and is a massive pain to try and make sure it didn’t miss any data. Not good working out and tracking anything accurately. Good luck trying to delete the data before it device resets.  I think it has potential but not ready to actually help yet.Would not recommend it at all. Sorry",1
2972,"Well after further review, I don't wear it much. Sleep measurement interesting.  As far as activity, I know what I am doing every day.  Tone of voice, who cares.  The body fat measurement is way off.  I had mine done electrically, 19%, the device says I am 27%.  Kind of a waste of time and money and a gimmick....like all these devices.",2
2973,I do like some of the features of the Halo but there isn’t anything about it that blows me away. The thing that really got me was that once you set up the Tone feature you can’t turn it off and it drains the battery really quickly. Sleep tracking is the best feature. Activity tracking is comparable to Fitbit.,2
2974,"La batería es pésima para un ""dispositivo inteligente"" solo dura 2 días a veces solo 1 y medio demasiado impreciso por la falta de pantalla se debe controlar directo del app y esa app no está disponible para algunos países de Latam, la medición corporal no es exacta y honestamente esperaba mucho más de este producto por el video de introducción tan brutal que tenían.",2
2975,"I had this 10 days and it stopped talking with the app.  I went through all troubleshooting with no luck.  I contacted Amazon to have it replaced to be told I could only have it refunded.  Even at a discounted price, this watch isn't worth it if Amazon won't back it.",1
2976,"I can't believe I paid 100 bucks for this and the better, nicer Halo with a screen and watch functionality is selling for 80 on best buy right now. This watch is fine, but it's been about a year and it has stopped working. It doesn't count my steps accurately, has a lot of trouble connecting to the app, and is generally just a bad buy because it's taking up prime real estate on my wrist without even telling me the time. Wish I could return it now 😭",1
2977,The heart rate monitor is very in accurate once you get around 20% battery lifeStep counter is vey inconsistent. I am very disappointed with this product,2
2978,"Needs to be on the market longer & tweaking done to the software.. my Google pixel 3 worked fine with the sync 90% of time for the first week, then it stopped giving me stats on sleep.. my husband's new iPhone 12 would not sync properly, We even got a me halo thinking it was the halo. No... It is because it needs more software updates & adjustments. Was Suprised it worked with my older phone but not the new apple product. Needless to say we returned them, & went with fitbit. The voice analysis is neat, but.. I think it actualy Goes by keywords it picks up, Not necessarily the tone being used. None the less - cool feature there.",1
2979,"The charging interface is very poor.  You have to wiggle it repeatedly to get it to make contact.  Both my device and my wife's device had the same issue.  The step counter was off by 12% from my Fitbit which I know is within 2% of being accurate based on distance walked.  The ""Tone"" feature has no real practical purpose that I can determine.  The sleep app was very poor compared to higher tech apps that are in the Apple Store.Overall, I love Amazon tech.  Amazon Echo and Kindle are out of the park awesome.  Unfortunately,  Halo just doesn't live up to their usual standard.  Maybe they can improve it in Gen 2 if it lasts that long.",1
2980,Used it for a week and was underwhelmed. About 8 yrs ago I had an early model Fitbit that did more back then than the Halo does today. Halo does not tell you how many calories you burned in a day. It doesn’t vibrate to give you workout reminders or wake you up. It doesn’t sync with any other apps like MyFitnessPal. I returned it.,2
2981,Stopped working and couldn’t get any help. I had it more than 90 days so did not get a refund even though I returned it.,2
2982,I love my halo! I look forward to other apps being able to pull its information. My favorite part is seeing how my sleep went for the night. I could go on about the pros to this device.,5
2983,"It lasted 4 months, with many problems and several calls to tech support for not synching and not charging.  The ""press the button twice"" instructions never worked.The sleep data was complete invalid, as it recorded my being asleep the moment I laid down. I reported this and they said they were aware of the issue and were trying to fix it.If you use the body shape tracker, it will drain the battery, requiring daily charging (sometimes twice a day).  I had to delete my photo and never used that feature again.The only good thing I can say is it was a pretty pink color and the Velcro band was very comfortable.  It was a disappointing piece of junk.",1
2984,"For 5 months, I was very happy with this item. Prior to this purchase, I had never owned a fitness band, and I had no basis of comparison.Unfortunately the item broke, the cover on the screen came off, and it began to malfunction. I’m giving this 2 stars because I was unable to purchase a replacement.",2
2985,I like the sleep tracker it tells me how long I slept how minutes it takes for me asleep also tells me poor sleep fair sleepI did not know I sleep only 4 to 5 hours per night,5
2986,Just not a good app at all not well put together at all the Fitbit and there’s so many other tracking fitness bands out there on the market and this one’s absolutely garbage wish I can get my money back honestly,1
2987,"There’s not much that one can do without paying the huge membership fee. As the data is not shared with Apple Health I can’t use it anywhere other than the Halo app. Every other app, even the small one time $2 fee apps share that data. Wish I realized this before making the purchase. I would have gone with a different option. I still will rather buy a different device instead of paying a monthly fee. Otherwise there are some other good and bad things about the app. So overall mixed reviews but this is a deal breaker for me.",1
2988,"Overall I love Amazon devices, but this one is more amazon phone than an echo.  I've used a fitbit since they launched and currently have an inspire.  Battery life is around 3 days even with ""tone"" off.  I would expect at least a week.  The activity is hard to understand and never could figure out what a ""point"" is.  Not worth $100.",2
2989,It’s super annoying how often you have to reset it and sync. A lot of the time I just assume it’s working until I go to see how many steps I’ve done only to realize it wasn’t even counting. Doesn’t stay charged long and can’t see anything on front of watch... only through your app. If I could return I would.,2
2990,I like how comfortable it is .  I hate wearing anything on my wrist but this is super comfy and I forget it’s even on!,5
2991,"No iPhone health integration. When using Tone the battery dies to quickly to wear 24/7. It is rather uncomfortable to sleep with on top, I have switched to wearing it on the underside of my wrist. I primarily wanted to experiment with tone, i would like a little more information what I said. Also it would be nice to know how i compare to others.",2
2992,I wear my Halo every day and love it. I really love the way it monitors my sleep. Having always been a bad sleeper it lets me adjust my sleep pattern and see what works for me,5
2993,"I purchased this about a year ago and am extremely unhappy with it. It isn’t accurate with activity or sleep. I have pain issues so I wake up numerous times during the night and have to shift my body. Once I wake  up to roll over it is done recording my sleep. So each night it records only 1-2 hours, then it apparently thinks I’m done sleeping. If I take an afternoon nap, then it won’t record that night. I now only use this when my $25 fitness tracker is charging. It was an absolute waste of money!",1
2994,"It does what it says it does. It is not bulky, it is comfortable and the app pulls in a lot of great info. I have an Apple watch and have tried Fitbit. This is a better health tracker than both.",5
2995,I should have tried this out as soon as I received it. Now it's too late to return it. It's just a nice piece of jewelry. Most of the stats I have to put in manually. The only thing it tracks well is sleep and heart rate.I should have just gotten another fitbit,2
2996,A little annoyed it doesn’t work with Apple health.,3
2997,I'm in love with this product. I still have to set up a few things yet but the step and sleeping tracker is very accurate. It makes you aware of things you can do daily to improve your health and sleep.,5
2998,"It's great as if you just want a step tracker and to use the app, but with some incredibly interesting options.  Getting data on my sleep and tone during the day has been enlightening.",5
2999,"The design of the charging clip for the band is horrible.  I've had nothing but trouble getting the band to charge since I day I got it and after 8 months of use it stopped charging completely.  I'm apparently not alone since this is known issue in the support forums with no fix.  Trying to get in touch with Amazon Customer Support is an exercise in futility.  This is a waste of money.  I can't get the band to charge and can't get anyone in Customer Support to help me so I'm out the purchase price.  Now I need to spend more money buying a Fitbit, which I should have done in the first place.  Don't waste your time or money on this.",1
3000,"It un syncs itself, it hasn't tracked anything but one night of sleep. It's totally worthless and frankly has NOT worked, more than it has worked. Have had to reset it, factory reset, resync it. The only thing that works on it is the recommended videos for exercise. I give it 5 negative stars.",1
3001,Calories tracking is way off. I tried resetting the band and also tried a different phone as the troubleshooting instruccions said sometimes there could be a bad connection between the band and the phone. The calories burned daily was showing doubled compared to my smart watch. I know I had been more active but burning between 4000 to 4500 calories is daily is very inaccurate.,2
3002,"I mean I love that it tracks your sleep. It’s super sensitive so Some nights it doesn’t track if too tight, loose or moves at all.The battery life I wish was a couple nights sleeps. It makes me not use it as much having to charge everyday.I already have to remember to charge my phone haha and that’s enough.Lastly and biggest issues is it got SO dirty so fast and there is no way to clean or replace the band.So I wouldn’t recommend this in the end.If the band was able to come off to clean or switch and the battery power was longer then I would.",1
3003,"I loved this tracker when I first received it.Recently it has stopped syncing my steps. I tried uninstalling the app, which wiped out my account and didn't help with the sync issue. I tried a factory reset and can't even get my tracker to connect with the app. Glad I got this as a promotional item.",2
3004,I like that it monitors your sleep and movement.  I dislike that it leaves a mark on your wrist after wearing all day.  So if you get it do not wear it all day,2
3005,"This is my first wearable, but I'm amazed at how accurate every feature is.",5
3006,"the sleep tracking is very interesting and the emotion and mood tracking is hilariously accurate, in a good way. as well as the integration with the smart app it is very discreet and helpful and is worth the money.",5
3007,"Band was good for most part with activities, etc. The sleep tracking not so much. Wouldn’t do consistently. When reaching out to support it’s the basic cookie cutter response. Even resetting the device didn’t do anything.",2
3008,"Sleep tracking is good, overall comfort is okay but wearing for extended periods of time can get a bit uncomfortable.",5
3009,Love the amazon halo works amazing. Love the features also. If I had to make a change I would add a food diary to this app.,5
3010,"I bought this Halo device in November 2020 in an early release. It worked ok for the first month or so until the first update came out. Since then I've had trouble syncing it to my phone and getting it to work correctly. To add insult to injury, the back of the device comes off and I've never even gotten the thing wet at all or hit it against anything hard! It just fell off when I was removing it to charge it. So, unless I get some support for this thing, which is only 11 months along, I'm chucking it and sticking to my tried and true Apple Watch.",1
3011,I track my heart rate while working out and over the last year I’ve tried to use the halo to replace my chest strap but it’s usually off by 30-40 bpm which is huge.  While I like the halo for my sleep and resting heart rate. None of the analytics are applicable since its estimates of workout intensity are so off.  I wish I could at least sync a more accurate chest strap with halos app for workouts.  Sadly I don’t use the halo at all anymore.,1
3012,"I really found this helpful to keep track of and help analyze my sleep patterns. I suffer from insomnia and have tried several different trackers and apps , I liked this the best out of all of them.",5
3013,I absolutely love everything about it. I like the look the most. It looks like a bracelet and not like a chunky tracker.,5
3014,"I was really excited for this product when I read the detail's about body fat measuring and measuring your voice tone, things my Fitbit Inspire HR didn't do.  So I gave this a try and wore it for a week.  The interface on seeing your steps, distance, and heart rate is not overly user friendly (or maybe I'm just used to the nice way Fitbit lays it out).  From a body fat standpoint, just go ahead take off your clothes and strip down and take a picture and let the device tell you where you are at.  Want to know about the tone in your voice, better make sure you have your charger at all times since this drains the battery in a day.  Overall less than impressed, went back to my Fitbit.  Any chance I can get my money back?",1
3015,Love the product,5
3016,Great little gadget… I especially liked the mood analysis and the sleep analysis.. nice little tool,5
3017,I wanted to love this but just couldn't.  It does it's job as a fitness tracker I guess but I didn't find anything useful about the body scan or the voice recognition.  I like to try different smartwatches and fitness bands and this one was one of the least helpful.,2
3018,I didn't ever feel comfortable with using the voice app. It requests permission to record and analyze every conversation and give you reports as to how you sound. Other than this feature and the fact that it doesn't have a screen this is just a stand fitness tracker. My phone does have these features without any excess devices.,2
3019,"To start I really wanted to love this device as something to help me improve my speech as I am a very timid person. This band does nothing to help with that, the speech recognition has a hit rate of less then 10% for me and that is beyond frustrating. I have done several hour plus presentations at work and the band would count less than five minutes of speech in the app. To me this really defeats the entire purpose of the device and leaves me with a expensive (monthly subscription to boot) fitness tracker. Here the device does well tracking activity and even the one I was worried about swimming.",1
3020,"I was pleased with my Halo until it just fell apart this week! I never showered with it or submerged it, which it says it is made to do. It does not hold up! I have worn this band for 9 months and paid the subscription fee and even though it is under warrantee, Amazon wants to charge me a $13 RESTOCKING FEE!!! FOR WHAT? I initially asked or a replacement that they were unable to do so I a refund was my only option. A refund minus a $13 restocking fee.I was going to repurchase but to pay a $13 restocking fee for a warrantee return is ridiculous!!!",1
3021,"I have had a halo band for about 7 months now. I like the sleep tracking and seems pretty accurate. The issue is make sure you open the app to make sure it connects every 24 hours or it won't count any points, but the app keeps getting better and easier to sync.** Now the main problem is after 7 months the battery sucks. I don't use the voice and it won't last 3 to 4 days on a charge. It used to last 7-10 days. Being a sealed unit you can't replace the battery.** as of now I would say it's not worth the price if the battery starts to fail within the first year.",1
3022,"I know this seems silly, but I am not one to carry around my phone 24x7 - so I am back to using my Fitbit full time - no pun intended.  Enjoy being able to see what time it is and where I am on my steps throughout the day.  I will say the voice component is pretty cool.",2
3023,I love the band and it keeps me healthy. Sleeptracking is very good and there is much more on the mobile app,5
3024,,5
3025,The battery doesn't last long. I didn't see half of the features.  Cheaply made.,2
3026,So disappointed with this product. After a few months the battery life tanked. I can't even get a full day's charge with the tone feature turned off. Its advertised as getting 7 days. With tone on I get a few hours at best. Clearly battery issue. They don't offer support after a short period so I am stuck with a useless product. Going to to see about opening a consumer protection case to get a replacement or refund. I'd run in the opposite direction.the tone feature is fun for a few days and is interesting but not usable given that it only works for a few hours before killing the battery.,1
3027,I love the fact that is tracts everything about your  health gives good tips on what to do and not to do.,5
3028,"I want to like it, but the fact that it dies every other day is a problem. I get maybe 36 hours before it dies. This makes it very inconvenient and hard to keep up with. I don’t recommend",2
3029,"This is a fantastic device if you want the following:1. To be shamed constantly for being ""sedentary""...stand in one place too long? lose points. sit too long? lose points. Lay down to go to sleep? lose points.2. No discernible ergonomics - This is the most uncomfortable fitness device in the market. Take a strap that is abrasive, add a half inch of rigid metal under it and place on top of our wrist...and then try to sleep with it. awesome.3. The app - Congrats Amazon on making a companion app for a display-less device as counter intuitive as possible.Really should be at a $50 price point...not even a good attempt at anything other than a money grab on the current fitness wearable trend.",1
3030,It great and makes for easy tracking since it is directly connected to my WW. Only difficult part is the Body composition application which can do dramatically up and down. So it can be confusing to use that option,5
3031,I spend more time trying to update my recent activity some times it wont update for 11 hours i keep push the button twice its not worth the time or money. Why didnt they input the time on this band ???,2
3032,"It has gotten so it will not sync, even after going through troubleshooting. It also is way off when tracking exercise. Voice recognition can’t be set to differentiate your audience.Originally, I have this 2 stars, but Customer Service didn’t like that, so they gave me a call because of the review, not because they were concerned about defective merchandise they sold. The rep. was very nice, but even though I told her I had already gone through the steps, she had me go through them again. Same result! The thing doesn’t work! She shipped me another one. It came and was in awful shape. It looks like someone scraped it on cement. I called to let Amazon know I was not happy with what they thought was a replacement. They refused to send another replacement.",1
3033,"I love the tracker, I just wish there were more colors and styles of bands. I haven't had any problems with the tracker. I wish the software was a little more detailed.",5
3034,"I'm not impressed. The bands inability to measure activity is too limited. We hen measuring live activity such as elliptical, it fails miserably. It is counting steps when I am not moving and not counting some that I am taking. I am sad to say that I am extremely disappointed. If I had saved the box, ok would simply return it. The app has so many glitchy issues that I don't even know where to begin. I'd like to think the sleep analysis is accurate, but who knows?",1
3035,"Worst watch like this I have ever owned. I was so excited about the sleep tracking but it really struggles to catch all your sleep, it will disconnect randomly just really not a fan of this.",1
3036,"This was a nightmare purchase. The device worked well initially, but then would not charge. I contacted Amazon support and expected a replacement charger. They sent another device without a charger and, of course, it did not charge either. I again contacted Amazon and they were supposed to send a replacement. I was told I could wait for the replacement and send the old devices in the package. I kept getting mixed messages about that. Today, I received an email telling me that I would be charged an additional $69. Since I do not know exactly what I will receive (band?) I do not know exactly what to return. If I had sent everything last time, I would only have a device without a band,etc. I am done. I cancelled the replacement and will return everything. Apple Watch, here I come!",1
3037,So far it is working well.  I don't think it tracks accurately if you are pushing a cart in the grocery store.  It would be better if you could attach it to your hip while shopping.,5
3038,"I had given it give stars but four months later, the heart rate tracker has become wildly inaccurate which makes the device pretty much worthless. I am very disappointed.",2
3039,Great while I play tennis. Does an incredible job tracking steps and sleep. The body fat feature is no accurate at all however.,5
3040,"After less than a year of use, the battery in this Halo band has lost most of it’s capacity, and now also takes forever to charge.",2
3041,"I got my device from the first batch they ever made.  I never took a shower or swam with it, so there is no reason for the case back to come off. They definitely need a stronger epoxy or a screw in the back. Since I do like the product, I may buy another one.",1
3042,I wanted this to work.  I switched from using a Fitbit for many years.  I've tried the Halo for about 2 months.  The app has a nice interface. But overall it's just an inferior product compared to Fitbit (granted Fitbit costs twice as much). This is definitely not worth paying a subscription for after 6 months which Fitbit does not require.,2
3043,I did not realize how much sleep I was NOT getting till I purchased this.  Love it!  Tracking my steps accurately and my sleep.,5
3044,"Wasn't sure how this would work but the app made it extremely easy. I've enjoyed reading how I speak to people using my halo and tracking steps, and my sleep. Charges really fast. Great product",5
3045,"The device is great. Bit too thick in my opinion. The worst thing is, however, that the band gave me an allergic reaction and rash on my wrist. Really frustrating.",1
3046,"It doesn't do what they claim.  Seems to be a work in progress, in the early stages.  Tried to get help with it, but they just don't have the programming set up right.  We had bought 2 & neither performed well.  We've bought fitbits now & are very Happy with those!",1
3047,Does what you want it to do. Simple. I just wanted a step counter and a heart rate monitor. Love the body scan and the projections. Good tool. Very happy with the purchase.,5
3048,"I really enjoy this band.  It's nice that there's no face & it's simply a tracker, although I do frequently try to check the time on it.  The cost is reasonable & I would get it again.",5
3049,"I used the Halo for about a month but stopped as it was uncomfortable to wear. The app seemed to work just fine, but can't be sure on accuracy. I recently tried to wear it again, but it won't turn on. After multiple frustrating attempts to contact support, I suppose I'm just stuck with a useless, uncomfortable wristband.",2
3050,Really neat tracker. I mainly use it for sleep tracking and activity but it also tracks body fat and voice tone. I love all the labs the mobile app offers.  I use the relaxation and sleep sounds often.,5
3051,"I absolutely love this band and app.  Talk about complete, this is packed.  It's comfortable to wear, private, and the app it amazing.  This package does what it says.  Very happy and we'll worth it.",5
3052,Use it and I don't,3
3053,This is very comfortable to wear and has an AMAZING battery life. I love that they offer a trial of the exercise programs and I love the variety of exercise/health programs. I only wish they offered more band choices.....,5
3054,"I had to stop wearing the band.  I am not sure if it was a rash or a burn, but I had a painful, red spot on my wrist where the sensor sat.Even without the rash, it didn't give me much value.  The whole system wasn't motivating for me at all.  There was no way that I could see to change the goals.  I was earning more than the weekly goal of 150 points in a day.  I didn't find the sleep score helpful either.  I would check the score in the morning and it would give me one reading.  I would then look later in the day, and it would have a different reading.",1
3055,I love the sleep tracking and step tracking. It is making me more mindful. It works as advertised,5
3056,Has a hard time syncing with app.,3
3057,"Love it for a week..then it no longer reads, tracks, or syncs well. It stop tracking my sleep first after 4 days of use and then I will get it synced and then there isn't any info to be read...so frustrated...",2
3058,"I liked nothing about this band. It irritated my wrist from day one. I started to give me a rash under my wrist and on the edge where is sat. Couldn't sleep with it bulky tracker on and it hurt my wrist. My wrist is boney, it left bruises on red irritation marks on my arm. It didn't work correctly during the day 1/2 the time. Worse idea WW & Amazon ever came out with. Trying to copy Fitbit's, Hated that too!",1
3059,"While this may be right for some people, I’m not a fan. It frequently will not sync with the app, the sleep tracker is not accurate (several times it’s said I’ve been sleeping when I clearly wasn’t), it left a rash on my wrist, and it has problems charging.Maybe I got a defective unit.I’m trying to return it now.",2
3060,Very nice product. I wish it could read oxygen in the blood along with heart rate. but over all it’s very nice.,5
3061,"Update: after seeing my review, an Amazon rep contacted me and sent a replacement. Thank YouDead in five months, very disappointing. I would not recommend. No warranty.",5
3062,The watch seemed to be amazing at first but it would die much quicker than the manual says.  It takes note of your tone but not as constant as you'd hope.  I tried to sleep with it once and it didn't record my pattern and it was uncomfortable to wear in bed.  I ended up returning it instead.,2
3063,"Just not what I expected for it to be. I guess the Apple Watch is what I was comparing it to, which I think is more practical because it is more interactive. Halo is interactive but you have to use cell phone for it.",2
3064,I love the the sleep tracker app is very accurate and the thickness of the halo band is awesome I just absolutely love my halo band I will recommend this halo band to all my friends and family,5
3065,The instrumental panel fell off (probably during charging) and the device stopped working just two months after I got it. There are may reviews describing the same problem. Amazon support is terrible. I’ve been chatting with them for over an hour. At first they refused to replace or refund. Then they finally acknowledged that I have a 90-day warranty which has NOT expired yet and still they refused to send a replacement. They offered a refund but they said they’ll charge a restocking fee for the refund! This is obnoxious and very likely even illegal,1
3066,"The Halo does everything I want in a fitness tracker. Heart Rate, Steps, Sleep Tracking, and an App to help with ideas for when I get bored. No notifications, buzzing any extraneous stuff to distract me.",5
3067,Accuracy has a very long way to go,3
3068,"I really like this. It’s lightweight, tracks my sleep patterns, my steps, and my heart rate. I find the app very helpful in motivating me to get moving! I don’t use the voice analyzer.",5
3069,I love this thing! I love tracking my sleep patterns and listening to my tone. The accuracy is astounding to me. It's comfortable to sleep with too. The Halo is the coolest thing I've ever ordered. Highly recommended.,5
3070,"This is my final review of this product. The halo band I have is a replacement after the first one failed. Customer service was quick to replace the first one leading me improve my rating. Well the back of this one fell out this morning when I took off to shower. Worse, it seems there is some sort of cheap adhesive that was holding the cover on which leads me to believe that either my item was refurbished or this a poor quality item. Either way I'm done.I bought this as an early user (i.e it's like I actually paid Amazon to be used as a tester) and was so flattered to be invited. I'm embarrassed but lesson learned.",1
3071,As long as it worked it was fine but after only 1 year and 1 month it stopped working. And the warranty is for only 1 year.  customer service was only going to give me 15% discount  off a new one. Guess I’ll buy a different one elsewherechanged my review to 1 star due to the joke of 6 mo. warranty and Amazon only wants to give you 15% off of a new one. I don't recommend this mainly due to poor warranty,1
3072,They've done a great job with this. Lot of data and they provide it in meaningful and actionable ways.,5
3073,Disappointed. Doesnt work ... Wrong info is logged if any at all.  Battery dies like less than a day. Seems like the app is just ads or links to articles that are sorta blog like. I feel like I could do some websurfing for free and its also uncomfortable. I was really excited for this but it fell short.. Way short.,2
3074,"I have fibromyalgia and have always had to sleep longer than most people. This app and band have shown me how well I’m sleeping, and allows me to adjust things so that I sleep better.",5
3075,At first I really liked the Halo. I wanted to track my activity and sleep but I didn't want the constant connectedness of a smart watch. After two months the device started to get really funny about charging. It would take multiple tries to get the clip to acknowledge the device and I would have to balance the clip exactly to get it to work. It would take longer and longer to charge. At three months it quit charging completely. I suspect there is something wrong with the charging clip. I contacted customer service to try to find out if I could buy a replacement charging clip and was told that is not an option. All in all this has turned out to be both a waste of money and an exercise in frustration.,1
3076,It's a decent product. But a few problems. Probably the biggest is for the price it's not enough features. Atleast a watch would have been nice to add. It also doesnt record the conversations you have so you don't know what you said that was happy or sad.,2
3077,"I could live with the fact that (unlike a FitBit) it doesn't have a watch display.  The app is another story.It kept giving me setup errors.  The final straw was trying to have the app take my picture for the body mass index (BMI) function:  No matter where I set the phone or angled it to take the required ""selfies,"" the app kept telling me the angle was too high or too low.  This is the main function I purchased it for.  My phone is not the problem.As an A+ Certified Tech, I work setting up devices, software and apps for a living (and I don't give up on things easily).  Needless to say, I returned it and deleted the app.  Until Amazon works out the glitches, stay away.",1
3078,It is an amazing sleep tracker with much needed insight into how I sleep night by night.,5
3079,Really enjoy the sleep app and the activity tracker. Haven’t set up the other features yet but definitely happy with this purchase.,5
3080,"I don’t like this product AT ALL. It has no  visible tracker, so you have to open your phone and sign on to see your data. It does not accumulate a history of resting heart beat, has only active data. The band is way too big for my wrist and there is no way to adjust it. I don’t like all the health advice mingled with the data. The sleep data does seem to be accurate. I don’t use the most outrageous feature - monitoring your “tone” which requires you to record your speech throughout the day. Amazon missed the mark on this product.",1
3081,My halo has encouraged me to pay greater attention to my activity level as well as the quality of my sleep. The app is easy to set up and use. Very happy with this purchase.,5
3082,"If I could give you zero stars, I would. The sleep tracking is completely inaccurate, Less than a year of owning it and it won’t sync or charge. I wish I had just returned it when it was within the window.",2
3083,When I get frustrated with my weight instead of giving up I turn to the body scan.  It tells you if you are losing body fat or not.  I love it.,5
3084,It's not that useful.,3
3085,This device has some good features. Downside is that one needs to keep opening the App to sync and see the stats. This I think is the biggest drawback followed by a low battery daily life specially if tone analysis is on!,2
3086,"I bought the Halo for tracking my sleep. I like that it doesn't have any lights while on, and I find it very comfortable to wear at night as I am a side sleeper.",5
3087,"It’s not a bad product, but not what I expected. As much as I love the body composition part it doesn’t seem to work all the time. I also feel the sleep portion of it is somewhat accurate but doesn’t seem to work here and there.  Also if you buy the protection plan you do get a working halo, however not only is it refurbished But they keep telling you that if you don’tReturn it they are going to charge you. I have proof it was returned and received and yet they still charged me as if they didn’t get it. I highly recommend not only not buying the product but not buying the protection plan because they will charge you no matter what",1
3088,I purchased this because I wanted a fitness tracker and sleep tracker that didn’t look like one.  The app was easy to use and the device fit perfectly.  I was so mad that all the features I wanted would kill the battery faster.  The device boasts a long battery life but with the settings dialed down to almost nothing I would be lucky to get a day.  There were multiple times that I would go to bed with 70% battery and wake up with it being dead.  This makes it so you lose all of your sleep tracking from that night.  If you want the voice monitoring and everything else bring a battery backup device so you can constantly charge it.  If you want short battery life your better off getting a watch.,1
3089,"The app crashes regularly, it never tracked when I was asleep, and didn’t not accurately track my activity. Also much bulkier than I expected, uncomfortable to sleep with.",2
3090,"Okay, interesting to watch over dats.",3
3091,I love the sleep tracking. And I am using the tone tracker to watch how I come across and communicate better.,5
3092,Works when it wants to,3
3093,"Inconsistent. Simply does not track sleep at all some nights and seems to miss activity, as registered by the Misfit Shine 2 that I am still wearing (and which I still love).  Also, the pale rose fabric strap is difficult to keep clean.  Oh, yeah - and the app likes to crash.  Don’t bother.",2
3094,"It was fine and helped me get back to working out. There is a massive problem though in that the application you must connect to spends most of its time crashing instead of working. When I first got the Halo at the end of November it was fine and worked clear through December. Then January came and the updates broke the app. Literally it spends more times crashing then working. It can't sync because the app crashes and so tracking any data and figuring out if I'm meeting personal goals goes out the window. I would hate it if I was actually paying for the subscription stuff since hey the app crashes which means you can't access the subscription insights and info. A rather useless device if the app refuses to work, so no don't buy this item.",1
3095,I only gave this 2 stars overall because the battery does not last as long as my much cheaper fitness tracker and the actual device was not comfortable to wear. I have a small wrist and it was difficult to wear and bend my wrist or wear sweaters over it. I ended up returning it after 3 days.,2
3096,"The tracking for sleep is way off based on my cpap readings. i don't care about having my ""tone"" analyzed. REALLY dislike not having a readout on the device - inconvenient to have to check the phone for info. Not what I was looking for and not impressed.",2
3097,"As an older person, the expectations were unrealistic.  I sent it back and am getting a refund.  Amazon was great with their response",2
3098,"It works great and looks much nicer than the Fitbit and other fitness watches. The app is super easy to use. The only negative is that it does not track your blood pressure, just BPM.",5
3099,"There are a lot more room for improvement. Maybe start with battery life. Mine would only last for 2-3 days. I have this and fitbit wearing at the same time on each wrist. The values in terms of steps, sleep evalautuon are close to each other. It just doesnt suit my needs, I would say just go invest on fitbit.",2
3100,"I love almost everything,  its labs are amazing. The sleep tracking helped me get more useful rest. Mobile app is easy. Only thing I don't think is that accurate is the body scan fat percentage.",5
3101,"I really like it, wish the app can be linked with Google fit",5
3102,"It was great at first, but now the mobile app crashes every time I try to open it. It is useless. I try to check my heart rate and by the time I get the app to work, my heart rate is resting. It hasn’t worked right in months.",2
3103,I have had my halo for months. I also have a Fitbit. The halo needs daily charging. I often forget to get it and put it on after it is charged. I seldom look at the data. I much prefer my Fitbit! I would say if you use a Fitbit or Apple Watch don’t bother.,2
3104,I bought this and since day 1 It hasn't tracked my sleep or heart rate.  I have factory reset it and switched wrists. So basically I have a band that tells me my tine of voice as also the body scan will not load no matter how many times I do it. I am very dissapointed.,2
3105,It could be a little bit better I wish you could tell me or send me notifications to move around,5
3106,Was not really what I needed. I already have an Apple Watch. Enough for me. But I was too late to send it back.  It was nice if you do not have other things to do the same thing. Enjoyed the voice thing though,2
3107,The lay out of the app is unorganized a chaotic. There is far too much going on and does not look near as clean as other fitness apps. In addition the app is not compatible with apple health or any other commonly used fitness/ health data apps.,1
3108,I was able to charge my halo a few times and then somehow one of my things on the charger messed up and went down and it is not connecting to the back of my watch to charge it. I am stuck now with a watch I cant charge or use.,2
3109,"Fitness band features worked well. Activity and sleep tracking improved my health as it became a game to get higher scores. Water resistant, but never got wet. Fell apart anyways on its own after 5 months of continuous wear (charged it while showering).",2
3110,My charger for the watch stopped working after a month now it can’t charge and I can’t use it at all,1
3111,It will tell me I did an “activity” when I just walked for more than a few minutes but it won’t register when I do an exercise class. I have to add it manually.,2
3112,I love this product because having the weekly score goals has motivated me to do more  cardio and seeing the points increasing while working out helps me get through the workout.,5
3113,The step tracker doesn’t seem very accurate.,3
3114,"Loved the concept,  sleek design.  However,  it stopped working,  froze after about 2 months.  Tried factory reset, nothing.  Quite disappointed",2
3115,"Bought this to track sleep. It didn’t work so I called Amazon. No solution after reinstalling app and reinstall of band. She said she would talk to the engineers and get back with me. No call after a week. My fit bit on the other wrist recorded sleep time. I bought it to track sleep. I wasn’t interestedI came in the other features. I will not spend my time further.Month later: no improvement in tracking sleep.  After a couple of weeks I did get an email from Amazon. The lady said to keep trying. Not helpful. Every complaint listed about the band, eg bulky, slow to charge etc, I found to be the case.I came back for a second try 6 months later. It still didn’t work.  Save your money.",1
3116,"It does it ALL. Sleep tracking , steps , heart rate ... Even recognizes your Voice tone.",5
3117,Just didn’t work for me.  Not using it but still paying monthly fee.  Have a hard time finding a way to cancel the charges,2
3118,Like my fitbit better.,3
3119,I haven't been able to wear this much. The cloth band chafed my skin and caused redness and the silicone band caused a rash. Maybe if Amazon comes out with another band option I'll finally get to see if this device is useful to me or not.,2
3120,Battery life is the plus along with option to carry or not carry the app with you sync option is excellentOnly wish you could be notified of steps either voice or display,5
3121,"Got for Free through life insurance, works great so far after 1st day.  Hardly even notice I have it on",5
3122,"Great concept...if only it would actually  work.For potential buyers-GOOGLE this before you buy it.After 2 days of trying to even get the device verified by code from Amazon (neither phone number, username, password, email) worked for the device,  After a few tries it locks you out.  Went it to check my account as all other products working fine (shopping, ring, echo, dot, show) with the same information.  Customer support was no help; they told me to 'wait and hour and try again'...as if I hadn't done that for many hours already.Lots of $$$ to spend looking at a piece of fabric.(Just generated my return label)",1
3123,"It tracks steps, heartbeat, and sleep pretty accurately. I also like the bodyfat and movement scanners.",5
3124,"I’m someone who works out multiple times throughout the day. I purchased Halo to track my workouts and view progress. Many of my exercises aren’t even acknowledged. Pretty frustrating. Giving it another few days, if it doesn’t improve, it’s going back. I do not recommend if you have a very active lifestyle.",2
3125,"I wanted to like it, but ultimately Amazon got a lot wrong on this. The battery life is awful. And the charger is finicky. After two months of ownership, it still takes multiple tries to get it to connect. Sleep tracking is not that accurate. Though, it does seem to function relatively well as an expensive pedometer.",2
3126,This product worked well for the first couple weeks. Now - the sensors are completely inaccurate making it essentially useless.,1
3127,"At least twice a week, I have to sync the device. Lately, even after syncing, it does not give me a readout on anything.",2
3128,Very disappointed in this item. The band is filthy and can not be removed to wash/scrub it clean. I'm used to seeing some info on the band but this item does not feature that. I purchased a medium based on my wrist diameter & I could have used a small.,2
3129,"Wore the device for 2 weeks.  At least three different nights, no sleep data was found.  More than half the nights said I slept considerably less than I actually did.  The pedometer was wildly inaccurate.  My mother had same problems with hers.  And while i liked the no screen aspect at purchase, old habits came back like second nature.  Never wore a smart watch, but did wear a watch for 25 years, but haven't worn a watch in last 5 years...but the number of times I raised my hand to check the time on the non existent display drove me crazy!  muscle memory!",1
3130,Compared to the Fitbit it may not have as many perks and whatnot but give it time and you will see the Amazon Halo will become quite the contender!,5
3131,Honestly this is a watch I make sure I always have on and it’s ready to go. The fat percentage scans are my favorite part of the app.,5
3132,"I really wanted to love this band. I got it when it was in the testing and people got selected to buy it.  There were quite a few people in the discussion group who had a similar issue that I did. The device actually hurt.  It would leave a mark on my wrist as if it were a burn mark.  So it became impossible to use.  I returned mine, though I have yet to receive my refund for it.  So just be aware when buying this.  You may be sensitive to it like many of use were.",1
3133,"Would probably not buy again.  After troubleshooting HALO malfunction issues per site recommendations , HALO became just a wrist accessory.  Continues not to work.  Removed it from use.",2
3134,"I like the band overall, but the laser thing on the back literally burnt off a mole directly underneath in about 5 days of wearing it…..kinda not okay? Amazon, will you please contact me about this?",2
3135,"Purchased in November, ot lasted 6 months and the plastic skin shield fell off. I dont wear the band in water  or in any situation being submerged. Doesn't seem like a good investment.  The app also crashes quite frequently.",2
3136,"Band worked great but after only five months of wearing, the tracker price fell off the band. There is no information anywhere on what to do in this situation. Product was okay when it had the tracker price. Very disappointed though.",2
3137,I love the new Halo.  It is comfortable and the tracking data is great.  Easy and efficient.  The Halo itself is light and the charge holds for days!,5
3138,Battery dies too quickly,3
3139,"This thing is junk. The data it collects is ridiculous and the smartphone interface seems to be nothing more than a platform to sell you more services. Meanwhile, the sleep monitor is wholly inaccurate and assumes you are awake if you snore. It awards a points system for different activity levels but is not very forgiving for things like sitting down.There is a green flashing light on the device that seems to be going nonstop. Where the light was, I now have a sore, red spot on my wrist. I wouldn't have cared, but it has been a week and it shows little sign of healing.I've learned my lesson with amazon branded electronics. I'll just either buy the higher priced, multi functioned devices like fitbit or go without, altogether.",1
3140,"Drom a former pro athlete:Complete disappointment. I'm savvy when it comes to how weight goes with muscle and fat, as well as measurements. The more I lost, the more fat % the Halo Body Scan said I had, and I'm talking it went up nearly 6% AFTER I lost 16 pounds. This device also claimed I was doing ""great* with my sleep, even though I was up 3 to 4 times a night. Absolutely ridiculous.The sports bands slip if you sweat even a little bit, and the regular band gets dirty so fast.Please do not waste your money on this device.",1
3141,"Stopped working after a year.  Not clear how to get support.  Even when it was working it was just okay.  Lack of integration with popular health sites.  Thought I would like the body analysis feature but only did that once.  Found I missed having a screen to provide time, steps, ... without having to open an app. What I did like was the battery life so I could track sleeping as well as daily activity.  Going back to the apple watch I think - even though that option is considerably more expensive.",1
3142,The voice part doesn't work anymore. The notifications run your phone batteries down.  I've changed the band and the metal part still smells like death. My wrist might be dying underneath the band. I'm REALLY not ready to turn into a Zombie yet. I have shite to do tomorrow....,2
3143,I love the sleep tracking aspect of this. The app tracks everything including voice tone and tracks body fat percentage as well. Way better than my Fitbit I owned previously.,5
3144,I bought this for 99 bucks and you will spend more time getting it to sync than it’s worth. Had it 2 years and the performance just gets worse. Totally unreliable.,1
3145,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The only thing I do not like about this watch is that is doesn’t tell time lol",5
3146,"I got this last night and so far, I'm loving it! I think it's going to help me sleep better, therefore get healthier mentally and physically. I'll be updating this after more time.",5
3147,My 16 yr old daughter absolutely loves this. It has actually confirmed her poor/inability to sleep problems. We have scheduled a sleep study in response to the Halo findings!,5
3148,Battery only last 5 days ( 100-20%) being without screen it should last more.Useless voice analytics & BMI Scan.I would prefer the fitbit charge 4 over it.,5
3149,I returned this item because it was super uncomfortable. The device wasn't working with the shape of my wrist and I felt like the corners were digging into it. Because of that I also definitely couldn't wear it at night ti sleep track. Im sad it didn't work out.,2
3150,"Constantly needs checked to ensure it hasn’t gone into “off wrist” mode. I got this thing to gain more data regarding my personal health, and specifically tone, with the impression it would hardly be noticed. The actual fit of the product is very nice, the band is comfortable, and the battery lasts as described. However, having to constantly check if it’s working is a bit of an inconvenience as it’s effectively just a $100 wristband.I’ve managed to figure out some tricks to get it working like hard resets, disconnecting and reconnecting, wiping off the lens on the underside, and keeping a good charge help.",1
3151,"I purchased Halo in November and benefitted from the introductory price.  But my Halo stopped working in less than 3 months.  It stopped syncing with my phone and could not be paired again with my phone although I followed all the instructions including factory reset.  The only thing Amazon could offer was to provide a partial refund or a credit toward a future purchase of another Halo.  This is the first exercise tracker I have purchased.  I thought that it must be reliable as it is an Amazon product.  I could not be more wrong.  Also, the battery does not last.  It requires daily charging, which is inconvenient.  I am considering purchasing another exercise tracker, but it won't be a Halo for sure.",1
3152,"I have had this three months.  It records steps pretty good, and it monitors voice.  That is sadly about all that it does.  If it monitors voice, it uses the battery up.  There are many step counters at a fraction of the cost!",2
3153,A good tool to help measure your sleep and Heartbeat. Also good to keep track of your actives in your day.,5
3154,"The first month I had it everything was fine, worked like a fitness tracker. Then when would wash my dishes it would say I was “working out”. It got to a point where it was saying that I was working out all the time, even when I was stagnant at home work and my heart rate was 86 ppm. Finally it started to say that my halo band wasn’t syncing properly. Then it stopped syncing 3 days would pass before it synced. I contacted Amazon multiple times and their solution was to send my a new halo that was scratched, dirty and evidently used. I’m so disappointed.",1
3155,"Detailed sleep tracking, an amazing digital body scan, and an exercise plan tailored to personal needs.",5
3156,"I find in enlightening that Amazon doesn't post negative reviews, so now I have to wonder about any of their reviews on.I stated and have not received anything showing this review was accepted and wonder if this one will be (pus I had a previous bad review for another product that wasn't posted or recognized as my even having sent it in)I do not recommend this product, still has too many issues.  Just glad I didn't pay for this.  Doesn't stay connected and difficult to reconnect/sync.",1
3157,Its fine. I just dont find a use for it. The sleep tracking seems inaccurate. The voice recognition is suspicious to say the least,2
3158,"I think this is a good idea but needs a lot of work. It wasn’t something I could personally get into the body scan is great everything else in comparison with what else is out there is I think below par, however if they work in it I think it could be better.",2
3159,It gives a good idea on sleep we insomniacs have!,5
3160,"I was very excited about this when I first heard about it, but have been very disappointed with the actual product for many reasonsIn order for it to register that you're wearing it, you have to put it on fairly tight. It has caused a major indent on my arm as well as painful bruising. Pictures attached.The main things I wanted it for were the sleep monitoring and tone of voice. Sadly the tone of voice function rapidly drains the battery and was having to charge it daily. The sleep monitoring is the only thing I really use, but sadly, after the 6 months free membership,  if I don't continue and pay monthly the only function I use turned off. I should've just bought a fitbit.",1
3161,Absolutely the worst product ever!!! Had this device since it first was released.. since then had to send it back once because the area where the sensor is came off. They sent a replacement in which I had to wait a long time to get. And yet the replacement has done the same thing. I'm over it and I really liked this product but the sensor glass isn't holding on I'm not sure if it's for long term using. I only took it off to shower and charge it. I wore it at night to track my sleeping patterns (insomnia) among other things. I'm oisswd I cannot return it. Money well wasted and down the drain.,1
3162,I thought heart rate broadcast would allow me to use with my Garmin. The Garmin connects but never displays the HR. Tried a factory reset and reconnecting multiple times. If you are thinking of using for a similar purpose forget it.,1
3163,"Edit 10/7/21:The back part that I assume protects your skin and the sensor came off. I purchased this product November 2020. It's currently being held together with tape, so it's now useless. I really liked the sleep tracker and body composition analysis.Edit 8/6/21:I switched to a Samsung phone and no longer have this issue.First review:Sometimes goes days without recording any activity even with a full charge and proper fit. When it does work, it's pretty accurate. Also, I don't know if it's a platform issue with the app, I find the device loses sync more often with iPhone.",1
3164,I like this better than any other step/fitness tracker.  I wish the replacement bands were a bit cheaper,5
3165,"I really liked this band, but I didn't use enough features to justify paying for the subscription. I just want to track sleep and see the workout intensity/point calculations. I don't care about the other garbage. Once you lose the subscription, it's really not worth having, you can't even get a discounted annual subscription.Pretty disappointed now, wish I would have known the extent of how much you actually lose after the subscription. Not even having a screen makes it even more useless without it.",1
3166,I love it,5
3167,"I had this for a couple weeks and returned. The body scanning for measuring fat is probably the only reason why you would want to get this if you have a membership at a gym that charges $50-100 per scan. Other than that it was disappointing and less than stellar. Obviously the app controls whatYour looking at. The workouts were not impressive on the app, measuring your tone could be impressive if it “measured you” and gave you feedback on what you said that made you get a sad or angry face. The tracking of exercise honestly wasn’t motivating at all. If you have an Apple Watch it is intuitive and is motivating. This devise is not that at all. And who wants to wear a band on each wrist all day. They measure different things.",1
3168,"This product is not really for prime time. The tone analyzer is useless as it does not let you hear back the conversation the app used to rate your tone.  If you want to monitor your tone, you have to press the device's button without any sign that it is actually working, and most of the time it is not. The all-day heart rate is hard to find. The only good thing about this product is the Body scan that can show you how your body would look at different BMI, but you don't need the device for that. That's basically the only thing working on this product.  The interface is clustered.",1
3169,I love this thing!! Keeps track of my sleep patterns and my heart rate which is great because I have heart disease and I can actually show my doctor the data collected.,5
3170,Still trying to figure out why Halo was promoted as something offering better features and accuracy than other activity trackers. It's basic in every way. I stopped using it after a few months.,2
3171,"Not accurate at all, was fun for a couple days. Sleep and voice function are not accurate at all. We don't even use it anymore and don't have an option to return it 30 days later.",2
3172,"I had hi hope for this product but after  few weeks using it and compare with my other devisees this product not ready for consumer. Battery time is too short, heart rate monitor is off and sleep trekker totally wrong! I will return this and wait for next generation!",2
3173,"It is ok, but you have to push buttons to make it do some operations.  This would be more useful if less manual, and of course it is pretty dumb to not have some kind of clock face.  I gave it a try, and just not impressed.",2
3174,"I am sad to say I am unimpressed with this device.  The syncing is terrible.  I wake up in the morning and want to see my sleep score, it takes me 5-10 min to sync if I can even get it to work.  The body scan is interesting but not all that useful.  The activity scores seem confusing.  I will not be updating my subscription, but I hope Amazon improves this product.  It is a great concept that is not working well at the moment.  I feel I have to charge it constantly, and I agree with other reviews the tone analysis is useless as it does not give you your specific statements, just very specific times.",1
3175,"The plastic/metal area that comes into contact with my skin made an itchy red rash. I only wore it at night to track sleep so it wasn’t because it was getting wet. I contacted Amazon and they were helpful and allowed me a refund.  Seems like an accurate tracking device, but I must have been allergic or sensitive to the metal on the back or something.",1
3176,I've had to call for a replacement three times since getting this band.  It just breaks.  It won't load movement or body info.  It just tells you to move to a more specific position over and over again to recognize you then says it can't see you and basically won't scan.  It's very frustrating.  It also loads a workout and your regular activity together stating you've earned more points than you actually have.,1
3177,I am admittedly a fitbit user but wanted to give this a try.  I hated it.  The app is clunky and annoying to navigate.  I also understand the picture taking for BMI but it is damn hard to find a space far enough away to take the picture successfully.,2
3178,"This is a sham. It uses the phone to scan your body but the reading is t accurate at all. It goes off the BMI scale which is not true at all. I have an athletic build and because of my height and weight, it tells me I’m obese at 40% body fat but when I use the calipers at the gym, im about 17%. Way off. No matter how good of sleep I get, it always reads my sleep as poor. It takes daily point away for me sitting at work. It’s just not good. Don’t waste your time especially if you already have something like a Fitbit or Apple Watch. Complete waste",1
3179,"Sleep tracking is okay, mobile app is very simple, I feel that this device is a lot more accurate than other devices in some places, I will update further at a later time.",5
3180,"Great device to keep tracking your progress, dayli workouts and calories.",5
3181,"Had to recharge each night, and the material is not easy to clean. Because it's not a watch, I had to wear this and my actual watch. I felt like it was too much since this is not stylish enough to be a bracelet.",2
3182,After buying several fitness bands and returning them I tried the Amazon Brand!This is absolutely wonderful  Light weight; not irritating to skin; app is the best I have ever seen!,5
3183,"Sleep tracking was far more accurate than any other device I've used. Aside from that, I have honestly just stopped wearing the Halo. The voice tracking is pretty invasive and not accurate. The Halo didn't really offer anything to make it stand out. I wish I had realized earlier on and returned it.",2
3184,Even with the tone turned off my halo charge doesn't even last 24 hours. I had to deregister it and then register again. We'll see. It was fully charged at 5:30pm today and it's already at 81% charged. Not even 5 hours and it's supposed to stay chargeded for 7 days?,2
3185,"I've been using this for 6 months - ordered for sleep tracking and really loved the programs to help sleep. I'm an incredibly active person and was excited to have this. Unfortunately, the backing that holds the piece together just completely melted off - it was GLUED on. I do not recommend this for people who are really active as this does not have the endurance and is poorly constructed. I feel like I've wasted so much time and money on this. I can't even get customer service to help me with this issue - I'm out ~$70 and a prime member.",1
3186,I wear a verse every day. I added this to help with my water/ mode/ BMI  I have only had it for about 2fays but I'm loving it so far.,5
3187,"At first, it was fine. Mostly comparable to other fitness watches. But, It never tracked sleep correctly. And some of the other features never worked, like the Body Fat analyzer. And the worst thing is that is has little memory whereas the app/watch sync has to constantly happen or you have no data to look back at,. Then when more and more updates came, the watch decided it was going to stop syncing with the phone, saying there are ""no users available"" or ""user cannot be recognized at this time"" and would not log anything I did. Waste of time and money. I would not recommend.",1
3188,"Dissatisfied.. based in what halo support told me, halo just track the sleep between 5pm to 6 am, it doesn't track naps during the day, or sleep after 6 am, Wich is really disappointed ( I guess is for people with not sleep issues😐🙄) having in mind I sleep until 7:30 am andI work in health and sometimes I have overnights, I would love to track my sleep during the day .... I'm pretty sure not all the people sleep just until 6 am🙄..Also, de fact I can take it to the pool ..🙄.. good concept, poor execution...",1
3189,To be honest i am not super happy with the product. The lifetime of the battery kind of sucks. The app doesn't really blow me away and compared to a fitbit bracelet it's kind of big.I would recommend to just buy a fitbit bracelet.,2
3190,"This was my Christmas present to myself, but ended up going back to Fitbit, an upgrade version.The Halo had to be reset to factory settings 3 times in the first 6 months.  Reset means all the data is lost, even though it is supposedly backed up in a cloud.  The voice recognition used so much battery, I had to charge the device at least once a day, sometimes more than once a day.  When the device stopped working a 4th time, I uninstalled the app and canceled the monthly charge, which had not even kicked in yet.  Kinda expected better from Amanzon.",1
3191,The Halo is a really fantastic product.  I gave this as a gift and the recipient said the body mapping feature has been particularly motivating. Well thought out and executed.,5
3192,I love my Halo band it keeps me in check on monitoring my sleep and activity daily.,5
3193,Best alternative than an I watch it fit bit many added features,5
3194,There is no indication on the watch when it needs to be charged. The only way to check results is on the mobile app but my phone is charging at night when I want to see my results.  Not into the point system. My fitbit offers more.,2
3195,Overall average. Can’t track naps.,3
3196,Didn’t track my steps or sleep. /:,2
3197,This has a weird tracking system - you get points for your activity but not sure what it equates too. I am also not sure how this connects to weight watchers and what makes it special. Only feature I like is the body scan. I would not buy this watch again.,2
3198,I love this band. It’s great for my smaller wrist. My favorite is the sleep tracking. The app is so easy to read.,5
3199,"Everything was fine until I had to uninstall the halo app and reinstall it. Ever since then, no matter what I do I'm not able to synchronize the halo band to the app. The reviews regarding the halo app from other users state the same thing. They have had no luck whatsoever in syncing either the halo band or the halo view to the app since the most recent update. Please help me and all the other unsatisfied customers.",1
3200,Helping in everyway,5
3201,"Battery life aweful. It has to be changed daily. Charging is a real pain. Poorly designed charger and it's is awkward to place into charger. The Body comp is interesting and probably more accurate and is then only justification incan give for giving it 1 star. Tone is not really useful. Random generic one word discription. And the Halo really is not useful without continuing the subscription. Dollar for dollar, if you are active get the whoop. Same concept but years ahead in functionality and design. With that said. Once the Halo is more refined and if the battery and charging gets better I may try again.",1
3202,"Thanks to some of the suggestions I've gotten from the data from my Halo, I've actually seen an improvement in my sleep and exercise routines. So far, this device has met my expectations.",5
3203,The battery didn't have enough life to be ready to collect data when I slept. I had higher hopes for this in fact I meant to return it but UPS didn't get close enough to my door to collect the package because of my dog.,2
3204,Tried on too heavy and not good fit on wrist.  I have skinny wrist may fit other people better.,2
3205,It does not track the steps/calories burned  accurately. I tested it in many different ways/movements of the wrist... apple and fit bit had higher step counts and were both in par with each other.... halo was way off and lower. I  had high hopes for this. Boo,2
3206,"I spent up to 15 minutes each morning trying to sync the app with the device. My iphone shows it connected via bluetooth however, I have to attempt multiple times to sync( including pushing the device button twice. Frequently when I attempt to open the mobile app, it immediately shuts down. about half the time, I just give up. The frustration has finally reached my breaking point. This poorly designed device has sucked away enough of my life. I should mention the exercise function is worthless. The sleep tracking function seems to work on the rare occasions that I can view the results. Voice recognition is sketchy.",1
3207,Worst fitness product I have ever used. Tracks sleep really poorly. If you wake up and then go back to sleep after 30 mins it wouldn't track it anymore.If you don't get a paid membership then the band is outright useless or even worse you get demotivated.Worst money grabbing scam from Amazon. They should just let people return the product and get their money back.,1
3208,"Body analysis, sleep data, labs for challenges.  Yup, not going back to fitbit.  I do miss seeing the time.  All in all I like it a lot!",5
3209,"It’s relatively cheap and great tracking, but as a watch guy it’s kinda big and not a comfortable band to wear in addition to a regular watch. I would be interested in a slim design.",2
3210,Good,5
3211,I tried swapping my cloth band for rhe sport silicone one assuming it would be easier to clean. Well because other than washing or bathing I never take the band off and I found that after a few nights sleep the band would cause rashes and sores. I have a Swatch watch with similar band material and wear it everyday with not a single mark on my arm buy the Halo band left them continuously. I had to change arms and still had same issue. Could not return son I ended up throwing it away and buying a black cloth band instead.,1
3212,Did not like that there is no face to check time or stats but especially time. Did not understand how voice/mood operation worked. Loved everything else about it though.,5
3213,"I was skeptical at first, but a few months of using the amazon halo and it has helped me a lot especially with sleeping.",5
3214,"The band worked great for a short period of time then would no longer recharge. I asked Amazon for a replacement which was not promptly carried out because they had no stock to send. The replacement halo was refurbished and did charge but would not pair as half of the LED lights did not work indicating that pairing was not possible. I again contacted Amazon and they tell me that the replacement is no longer available for return. So I do not recommend this product with its limited features, moisture sensitivity and dubious performance. For the cost you can buy 2-3 Misfit Shine 2 which is much better in water climates and sports.",1
3215,"I enjoy some of the features like the body scan, and tone tracker. I constantly have to reset it though and I wish it tracked more things so you could see trends in activity, because  it’s not letting me understand my body any better",2
3216,I have used this halo band for more than a month. I like it better than my Fitbit that I previously had. Tone feature is great and it is very accurate.,5
3217,"Pretty great for everything I was looking for compared to the Whoop. The fabric band is wearing after only about 2 month of Velcro use. Other than that, excellent product.",5
3218,The only problem I really has is the charger is bad. It’s really tough to get the thing in the right position for the batter to charge.,5
3219,"Looooove it! Not only track my sleep and my voice tone, it also helps with knowing what my body needs and it’s all in one amazing app!",5
3220,Just wish it was compatible with kindle fire.  My son wants one too and doesn't have a smart phone.,5
3221,"After wearing it for about a month (removing for showers) I woke up one morning with a burn mark where the sensor is located. There was also a bunch of black stuff coming from there the button is. I contacted amazon and they only offered to refund me with a return and claimed it would soon be removed from the market, which is obviously a lie. So be careful .",1
3222,"It does not record when I sleep in my easy chair.It does not record my steps when I am riding a bicycle.It is not clear when one week starts and another starts.It says that I get no deep sleep, which is hard to believe.",2
3223,"The Sleep tracking is amazing! In the past we had to go to a sleep study session in a lab, but now with this I can do the sleep study every night!",5
3224,Love how it breaks everything down. I like all the program choices to help aid you on your journey.,5
3225,"Activity tracking and steps counting are very inaccurate. I frequently have to manually enter an activity, because the Halo completely misses a workout (even the high intensity workouts).  I’m glad I bought this early before it was full price. I’ll be switching back to a FitBit.",2
3226,Having fun learning about my sleep patterns and the detailed activity tracker has been eye opening.  Lots of other features that I haven’t even checked out yet!!,5
3227,"I have little confidence that the sleep tracker is accurate.The steps and activities logging does not match my Apple Watch that uses GPS.The medium size band was too small, and is hard to get over my hand.Would appreciate if Amazon would send me a large replacement band.",2
3228,Don’t waste your money. Better to invest in an Apple Watch or Fitbit. The body scan fat percentage system is super inaccurate. It does reliable track your heart rate and movement but not in a way that’s any better than existing products,2
3229,"The product is OK, but when I had issues with it, customer service was bad. So bad, that the product doesn't worth it's money",2
3230,Loved the sleep function on this device. Felt it was mostly accurate. The bad/dislike aspect of this device was the fact that I switched iPhone from a 12 to a 13 pro max and was unable to log in under my profile to pair with my new device. I have a subscription that I can’t use. If can log in under a new profile but I lose my subscription and I have to start over with my history. SAD DAY IN AMERICA. Back to Apple watches I go.,1
3231,I was looking for something I could wear that didnt have a screen but still provided me with the data I received on my fitbit smartwatch.  I have quite a few analog watches I like to wear but want make sure to capture my daily data.  I had hoped the halo would fit the bill.  To test it out I wore my fitbit and halo for two full weeks.  I found the data on the halo to be very different than what my fitbit recorded.  Also and this is on me I didnt realzie the halo doesnt have an alarm.  Since I prefer to have my band wake me up instead of an alarm that would wake my wife this was a deal breaker for me.,1
3232,"Not the best sleep tracker... voice tacking highly reduces battery, cool feature but not great option. Then 2 weeks after support end... 6 months 2 weeks after purchase item now isn't useable",2
3233,"Seems like these things might only last a year or much less. First one I bought lasted almost a year before the plastic piece, that covers the sensors that touch your skin, on back fell off. I hardly ever showered with it on and never swam with it. Still fell apart. Returned under warranty. Replacement band came in and lasted two months. Band reached 0% and never charged again. Sending back....again.",1
3234,"In less than 6 months a piece came off and no longer can track sleep without this piece attached. Normal wear, nothing unusual, just taking it off to shower and charge.",2
3235,"I used halo everyday for three months and then it just failed.  Refused to pair.  Lost all my data.No response from customer service.  The thing just doesn’t work anymore and it appears Amazon just leaves you hanging.  No response whatsoever from customer service.Unfortunately I bought another band for this thing last month when it seemed to work for me.  I’m out almost $100 fir this experiment.  All I can hope is that Amazon doesn’t charge me the monthly fee.  There was no way to cancel since there is no customer service/support for this.They contacted me, invited me to send back the halo for a refund which I did on 2/1.  Nothing.  No response.",1
3236,I was excited to get this to help track my activity and sleep.  The battery only lasts 1 1/2 days max.  I was looking for something to replace my samsung watch which is bulky but not a fan of having to charge it each day,2
3237,"This device is pretty useless, a lot of time it doesn't track or if it does it doesn't seem very accurate.  I try another better tracker if I were you.",2
3238,"This is really only good for sleep and HR tracking as of now. Unfortunately it doesn't do either particularly well. This has lots of potential, but probably shouldn't have been released yet.",2
3239,"The step count is way too high, the voice option is too general but the sleep tracking makes the purchase worthwhile. I will keep it but would not have ordered it had I known that these areas were lacking. The monthly subscription service is also too high priced.",2
3240,This burned the heck out my wrist  Return to sender!,1
3241,So I wear it on my left wrist and you can set it for the left wrist also if it would only work. This dumb thing Is almost two inches from my wrist bone I've pushed button twice and it just doesn't ever want to work. I'll set it and I'll check it in hr or two and it's not working!!! It's a piece of overpriced junk!!!! I definitely need to send it back!!!,1
3242,"I have had this band for 2 days and have had to delete the app and redownload and redo the setup 3 times! Currently my band has not been syncing for over 2 hours even though my phone is in my pocket and my bluetooth says the device is paired with my phone. For a company that prides itself on mining personal information about their customers, you would think the one device that we purchase to ALLOW them to have access to our information would freaking WORK!!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!",1
3243,This is one of the worst trackers I’ve owned. The main issue is that it won’t sync and update easily. I’ve had to disconnect it from Bluetooth multiple times now and it’s just super unreliable.,2
3244,Poor battery life,3
3245,"The sleep tracking is horribly inaccurate and completely useless. I know I don't tend to sleep overly well to begin with but it was telling me I was awake for HOURS sometimes when I know I wasn't. Finally borrowed my wife's fitbit to compare and after two nights ... well look at the pictures. The 39 and 77 were night of testing 1, the 55 and 67 were night of testing 2.The tone thing might be helpful but it really seems to only recognize words NOT TONE. I can't be 100% certain since it doesn't tell you what you said that it scores, only that you said something at 5:36. Granted, knowing it was recording full conversations would make me throw it a fire but still.",1
3246,My Halo band worked great for a couple of days. Stop working. Tried all the trouble shooting suggestions. It will charge now but will not paid to the app. Waste of money even on sale. Do NOT recommend.,1
3247,"The Halo is changing our lives. Super comfy, seems to be accurate, simply and amazing product. Well done!!!!",5
3248,Work well at first but we are now on 2 out of 3 not working or holding a charge,2
3249,"I got this device when it was first released and quickly realized it left much to be desired. I think this happens a lot when Amazon first rolls things out. It wasn't like it was cheap either. After using for about a month, it didn't do much to track conversations/moods like it advertised. Even on the most sensitive setting.  Battery life was lasting just over a day, maybe close to two. It now sits as a paperweight in a box somewhere and I went back to my fitbit.  Save your money. Get a different device.",1
3250,Zero tone feedback....set from 7am to 6pm and zero tone feedback?  This is the only reason I purchased the Halo over Fitbit....and zero tone feedback. Really??,1
3251,"Sleep tracking provides no usable info but does say % of light, REM, and deep. Thats all you get. Step tracking isn't accurate. Cannot set reminders. It really doesn't do much. And battery has a short life, requiring charging every 8-10 hrs which limits its effectiveness.",2
3252,Love how it tracks my sleep and tone.  I have the Apple Watch 6 and it doesn’t track my sleep as well as the Halo.,5
3253,"I thought this would be something great to try.  I was not as worried about the body framing that you are asked to do.  I was more concerned about paying $60-100 for a device THEN paying a subscription fee no matter what services you actually want to use or frequent, with no screen.I have had 5-6 different iterations of FitBit devices, so I have gotten used to the screen, the clock, etc.  This seemed like a possible decent deal, without the subscription. I hope they remove that, to get more people to try it out.",1
3254,"I bought this because it went with weight watcher app. It hasn't been sending my tracked sleep since ... never. Also,  it stopped sending my steps and activity over a week ago. Conveniently stops working right outside the return window 😡",2
3255,"Disappointment. The tracking seems off. I bought this for the voice recognition component, but it is no actionable or insightful. In the attempt to have fewer buttons, the halo has become overly complex--purple lights, green lights, white blinking lights. I have had to call customer service several times and then routed to the retail side. I could not get ahold of aperson to help me. So now I have a dead halo watch that no one at Amazon can help me to sync.It does not allow you to turn off the alerts/messaging areas you do not want. So I see the same areas again and again.",1
3256,"So I would not recommend this product, especially if you are allergic to nickel. This was the first wrist band I’ve ever worn, and for the first 24 hours, I felt as though it was shocking me. I woke up in the middle of the night to find abrasions on my skin and a rash from the nickel. We think the abrasions are from something leaking onto my skin. I received this as a Christmas gift, and it’s been about a week, and even with an antibiotic, it is still not healed. Get an Apple Watch instead, which is made of medical grade nickel and contains less than 1%, according to research I’ve found. My family has returned the halo and none of us plan on getting one ever again.",1
3257,Would like to see a total recovery feature based on prior day activity and quality of sleep from prior night implying how much energy I have for the day ahead,5
3258,"This thing is uncomfortable to wear while sleeping, the steps were about 1000 off from my alegra TRAQ shoes, but to be fair at my job I push shopping carts a lot, so my arms don’t swing and there is no clock on it,  while it is a good idea In theory I can’t wear my Apple Watch and this thing at the same time, and I hate lugging around my massive iPhone 8+ in my pocket just to keep track of the time.  All in all, I love Amazon products and I truly do wish that this could have replaced my old series 3, but I just need the clock aspect, the rest could be looked over.",1
3259,I absolutely love this fitness wearable! It's so comprehensive and accurate. It motivates me to continue my quest to fitness. I highly recommend this device!,5
3260,"This was kind of fun and useful. I won it so it feels a little awkward leaving a negative review but after having it for about 3 weeks, the charger stopped... well, charging. So now it’s a dead gadget that was fun for a bit.",2
3261,"Love the band. Not a flashy, discrete band that has days of battery life. A super affordable fitness band. The app needs some improvements but it gets the job done.",5
3262,"I have had nothing but negative issues with this device from the beginning… today was the final straw!  I threw it in the trash as it has not tracked steps or sleep for the past three days even though it’s fully charged.  It would do this during my trial phase so I chose NOT to continue the membership.  The issues still persisted, but enough is enough.  My recommendation is to pass on this purchase!",1
3263,"I have used this for a few months & everything was fine. It didn’t sync for a few days so reset. I have now lost all my data. The app keeps saying I can’t submit a review for ‘Duplicate name’ no matter how much I modify my name.  So, leaving this bad review here. I can’t believe in this day & age, data can’t be sync’d even after an issue, especially considering how good Amazon is at data mining. Do better Amazon.",1
3264,It's not a fitbit. It's just no where near as good as a fitbit for a similar price. Is has a required subscription. Tone tracking is garbage. The only redeeming thing is the body fat tracking who h has nothing to do with the band.,2
3265,"Disappointed by the lack of personal customization and half baked functionality of the device. Needs a lot of work. Also I would prefer a standalone device with a built-in screen. Keep perfecting, please. Great idea but its execution suggests that its modest pricing led to its lackluster application.",2
3266,"I am really enjoying my halo. I like how the band fits, and it is very comfy. I enjoy everything the app has to offer along with it.",5
3267,Really like the Halo!  Measures steps and sleep perfectly!!  Battery last at least 3 days!,5
3268,"Halo Band arrived on 12/28/2020. After three days of use, the band will no longer pair with my Android phone. Also, after following all troubleshooting steps provided within the app (including factory reset and performing all setup steps again), the band still will not pair with my phone or update any statistics such as steps, heart rate, sleep, etc. Amazon technical support kindly offered to replace the band since they couldn't solve the problem, but how many times is this going to happen? The Amazon Halo is a glorified fitness and sleep tracker that works intermittently (just like the Fitbit). The BMI and Voice Tone features reduce the battery life to 1-2 days which isn't helpful either. Bottom line... Don't waste your money on this band until it matures.",1
3269,"I was really looking forward to trying this when I got it. I have trouble sleeping so I thought this could help me figure out my sleeping patterns. It did the first few weeks then I started noticing that my score was one thing in the morning and it changed in the afternoon. Now I’m lucky if I get any score at all. The voice recognition is neat, but uses up the battery quickly. Needless to say improvements need to be made....Amazon underdelivered with the Halo.Update.....the sleep tracking has gotten considerably worse. It shows being awake when I’ve actually been sleeping. Completely inaccurate even after resetting per Amazon’s recommendation. Disappointed...wish I could get my money back.",1
3270,"Perfect for someone who isn’t interested in the other smart watch features like texting or calling,tracts everything just as accurate as some of the other watches out there.",5
3271,"Love love love the sleep tracking. I get my steps in, lots of other perks. Looks great. I wear it with tracker on the inside of my wrist.",5
3272,My halo is awesome! Already outlived my other fit bands. I like the sleep tracking and can't wait to use in the pool.,5
3273,Started of with a good start and lasted only 2 days.Not connecting anymore,2
3274,"I love the app but the wristband turned out to be a waste of time and money.Tone is a gimmick that drains your battery life.  I turned it off so I don’t have to charge the band every day.Last night I noticed this black plastic on my arm and it was the back of the band! I have sensitive kin so I cannot where it 24/7 or I get a rash. So how does the plastic backing fall out!  Now I have a band I can’t return because it happened 1 1/2 months after the return window. So upset, This is the last time I support an Amazon product.",1
3275,"Very unhappy about the monthly fee. I’m currently in a free trial period and will cancel as soon as it’s over. Does not have a time display, which is annoying when it’s to be worn on your wrist.",2
3276,"I use my apple watch for day-to-day activity, mainly because it's on the screen and I don't have to sign-in to the app.",5
3277,"Got it in early access and thought I'd give it a try over a fitbit. Not worth it. It doesn't hold a charge beyond 1 day for me at this point (voice recognition off), I wore both my fitbit and this for a few days and got wildly different data, haven't had a single night accurate sleep tracking (puts me to sleep before I'm in bed and has me fully up at inaccurate times). Not having a screen for quick tracking of activity is also a bummer but not a deal breaker. I will no longer be using this because it isn't worth the hassel of charging daily and sometimes twice a day.",1
3278,I could not figure this one out  I had to return it,2
3279,I love this band! Everything is simple to use and I especially love the voice recognition! I recommend it to anyone wanting to self care.,5
3280,It does what it says but probably better off just buying a smart watch which gives you so much more,2
3281,Keeps disconnecting,3
3282,"Poor plan. Poor design. Poor software. Poor execution. have much to write, but no time at the moment. I will update with a fuller review later. Just wanted to get a little extra feedback out there in case it might help someone make a decision. I tried very hard to use it for two months. It arrived at the end of October, and it ceased physically to be usable on December 25. I am an early adopter and technologically skilled and experienced. And for the purposes for which I had the Halo I have now gone back to a Gear Fit 2 Pro. I will probably try the next iteration. Amazon is not the kind of company to sit back and do this poorly twice in a row.",1
3283,Expected better functional tracker from Amazon. Piece of crap. Unfortunately can’t return nowSubscription cost is frustrating for this low level technology. Amazon if you reading this please give me my money back,2
3284,"Not a bad fitness and sleep tracker for an entry level person with no other trackers. Compared to the Apple Watch, it doesn’t shine a candle to it. The tone feature is amazing, but is in the early phases...so I’d wait for Apples version of it.",2
3285,This is a good try but huge miss. It’s ridiculous to not have the ability to use a screen on a device like this. It’s short sighted for people exercising who are wanting to track data such as heart rate on the screen instead of having to use the phone. It’s not comfortable. The part that made me finally return it was the charger. I’ve used a plethora of devices and never have any been so difficult just to charge. Amazon needs to go back to the drawing board and make this a better thought out device that is relevant to what people want and need today. This isn’t it.,1
3286,I really like the way it measures my sleep.  Wish there was some way to clean it.  Probably should have gotten black,5
3287,"Halo is useless without membership. I understand that they charge for premium training material, voice analysis or detailed sleep analysis, and I am fine with that. I can do without that.But without membership you basically just get a (glorified) step counter. Your phone can do that (and does that automatically), you don't need a fitness band for that. The app is littered with lock-symbols, flaunting all the things you cannot see without premium membership. Don't get Halo if you're not willing to spend $$ every month for membership.",1
3288,This product just wasn't for me. The only thing that worked was the sleep tracking. It couldn't recognize my voice and getting a picture of my body was very hard to do and it still didn't work. So I returned it.,2
3289,"Bought for my mom for Christmas, she only uses for sleep tracking and steps, which helps the battery last even longer. She loves the app and tracker!",5
3290,Love it provided insight into my health,5
3291,I really like the sleep tracking but the step counter is way off. I tested it against 2 other trackers. It's a shame because its a really good concept. I also hate that they deduct points when you're sedentary.,2
3292,Don’t waste the money. Wish I could return but I’m past my return date. Doesn’t do anything special. I haven’t even worn it in weeks. What a waste,2
3293,I was enjoying the Halo Band and seemed to be working well. Until I upgraded my phone and every sense then I can NOT use the Subscription that I have as it does not recognize me and Amazon Support has been horrific. I have spent way too much time trying to get this to work again. I would wait until they are on version 3 or beyond before purchasing.,1
3294,This system is very accurate and have had nothing but positive experience. I often don’t even realize I have it on.,5
3295,"I wanted this device to work, but it just is not what it is cracked up to be. First, I own a Fitbit. It is a very good tracker that pairs well with my iPad and iPhone. It does everything that I want a tracker to for me. Second, the Halo band does basically the same, but without visual. I thought I could wear the Halo and wear my collection of watches. But after awhile , not only did the band become a bother, it was a pain to always go to my phone to check on my stats. Third, I purchased a new phone, and after several tries...multiple tries, it doesn’t pair. It now becomes an irritation rather than a tracker. I will not be continuing my contract.",1
3296,"Product came without necessary charger. Tech support was useless because they made me buy a Fitbit charger which is not compatible with Halo. Overall, experience with Halo has been nonexistent and disappointing.",2
3297,"I could not sync, could not read, could not see time, I like my fitbit better.",2
3298,"Updated 1/1/2020- now the thing won't sync and one day it tells me to sync through the app and the next day it tells me to sync by pressing the button twice. There are zero instructions on how to use the app. There's no way to measure conversations via the voice tracking. Overall it's a smart idea with a terrible app. They could at least make it a watch. It's a bulky contraption that tells me what an angry, nervous SOB I am. The real time voice tracking does not work at all. The app might as well been made by the guy who made the snake game. Shame on you Amazon for putting out an item that's half done. And why doesn't it have time???",1
3299,"After several weeks wearing the Halo Band, and really, really wanting to like it and integrate it into my routines, I have decided to return it. Sleep tracking is terrible (perhaps being able to make a manual adjustment to sleep/wake times would be a good start?) Starts sleep cycle while still on couch reading, watching tv etc. before bed resulting in lower and completely inaccurate sleep scores - rendering them useless. Need to remove band and put back on before bed to trick the sleep time. Wear a Garmin watch as well, sleep is recorded properly 9x out of 10. Perhaps will be adjusted with future updates? I would look elsewhere for a fitness tracking/band as this is still a work in progress.",1
3300,"The halo band works well when it works, but it often completely de-syncs and you have to spend 15 infuriating minutes setting it up again. I've stopped using it after having to set it up for the fifth time.",2
3301,"...purchased at promotional price... tracks 4 principal activities: movement, sleep, tone, and body image... a useful device that also can impart additional information specific to interest and need",5
3302,"Amazon has a lot to work in this device. Battery runs out really fast, voice recognition is not accurate and the other functions are really limited.Do not recommend this product.",2
3303,"Had a few fitness watches, but not having a display is great. Love this tracker,",5
3304,"Great idea.Device has kinks that need to be worked out. Had issues with losing all my data and had to go through the entire set up process multiple times. I left a poor review. Someone called me (good initiative) they sent a replacement.The replacement they sent is Refurbished. Not new... How cheap can you get? You send a bad product and as a fix, you send me a previously known bad product. These feel cheap and are made in China. You really can't send a new one? I paid for a new one, not a refurbished one. These things are brand new and shouldn't have all these problems yet.I'm returning it and going with another brand.",1
3305,"I have really enjoyed the Halo - the applications are great and much better than most.  When I first received it, required about an hour to charge to 100%  This morning (and last few days) I have had it plugged in for 5+ hours and it is still not at 100% - after less than a month's worth of use.  And there is NO SUPPORT OFFERED for this product.  This should not be happening after less than a month of service - so while the concept is amazing, I currently can only wear the device for 16 hours a day - which of course is useless.  Will probably be returning mine - which is a shame because the functionality is really cool.",1
3306,The sleep tracking is really good and tone analysis is okay but what I really don't like about this product is not knowing if it's on or not until you lift it up and see the green light under the band or check your phone.,2
3307,"The app often flips to a font size that is tiny for no reason, only way to fix is to quit and relaunch, sleep tracking misses entire nights, but when it works, it is pretty cool.  Using the voice stress thing on an automatic occasional sample drains battery, while it is off, it gets good battery life.  Very unhappy with purchase.  Just ordered a black friday garmin to replace this as it kida sucks",1
3308,I have worn a fit bit and have an Apple Watch and this Halo is better than both of them.  LOVE IT,5
3309,"I wish I still had the option to return. It's just not for me. Voice recognition didn't work that great. I didn't sleep well with it on, slept better when it was off. Just not my thing.",2
3310,"Device stopped charging out of blue after 4 months. Since it is under warranty, I exchanged it. Not sure how the experience will be. I didn’t have option to return it given it has been 4 months. It is a cost effective option for sleep tracking and other health data but if reliability remains a concern then I wish I had gone for more expensive but reliable option.",1
3311,So far it seems pretty good. Waiting for more apps to sync with it. Assume they will once it’s been around for a bit.,5
3312,I bought one of these on the pre-release sale and ended up returning it. It’s not worth your $$. I actually really love the idea behind it but it needs some help. My biggest complaint is I have a very small wrist and tried to wear it at night but it was too big and the metal rubbed up against my wrist bone and was raw. Amazon please don’t give up on this idea though! I would love to try it again once you’ve made improvements.,1
3313,"Sleek look, great app, insightful data. Only wish the device was accurate. I regularly do insanity max 30 and notice the heart rate monitor sits below moderate even though my Samsung band registers > 160bpm. Sleep tracking also seemed a bit inaccurate on multiple occasions",2
3314,Love my Halo! It’s motivated me to get off my duff more than a few times. Just wish it had a longer battery life.,5
3315,"I was really hoping this would be a great product, but unfortunately I was greatly disappointed.  I will definitely go with a better product like fitbit or something else.  This was great on promise but terrible on delivery.",2
3316,"Three months in and the Halo has entirely stopped holding a charge. At first I thought I had just missed the notification for a low battery or that it hadn’t fully charged last time. But now, repeatedly, I’ve gone to check the app only to find it listed as disconnected within 24 hrs of being fully charged. I try to turn it back on and the battery is completely dead again. I don’t even wear it to shower, so it’s not a question of if water has gotten into it. Clearly this product was not ready for release. And of course, the return window closed two weeks ago. What a waste of money.",1
3317,"I was an early adopter of the product, wanted to see what Amazon tech could do vs Apple, Whoop etc... My experience started off well, everything connected easy, then basically went down hill quickly. The main complaints were around connectivity and app, I own an iPhone 10 and it seemed to come unpaired often, which for a wearable is not ideal. The app however also seemed to lag behind competitors out there. Unfortunately, I missed my return window :(I recently bought the Whoop strap and so far so good, I'd start there if I was doing it over again",1
3318,"The Halo does not sync, the screen rarely stays active even while you try to look at items.  I’m throwing mine away.  Interesting idea, but not programmed well.  I’m going back to a Fitbit.",2
3319,This device works great along with the app. The issue is that a small metal plate on the back of the device. This device is essential for protecting the device and your skin. The plate in less than a year separated from the device. As a result the device is no longer water proof or sweat proof. Also the device when worn without this essential plate will cause skin irritation.,1
3320,So I was excited about this product and was disappointed when I opened the box. I probably could've read the description but I didn't think about it because Amazon released another great product. It's smaller than I thought it would be where it looks more like a little kid's bracelet instead of a wearable device (Not sure if that was the intent). The amount that you can do with the device is not what I originally thought as it only works with a limited list of services/providers to give you health data. There is definitely potential but I think I got it in its early infancy. Maybe the second generation will be way better.,1
3321,"Unit died and quit charging Jan 23rd following my original receipt Dec. 6,  2020. Amazon says I will possibly have the replacement shipped March 7th 2021. Fingers crossed.  I am too ticked to bother reviewing further.",2
3322,I’m not sure why I bought this?  It is fine in you want to track your sleep data and you heart rate or steps. Not for fitness.I have an Apple Watch and that is better/different than this.,2
3323,I like the sleep tracking and my activity levels during the day. The mobil app is easy to use and has lots of useful information!,5
3324,I am not sure if the sleep tracker is accurate as I wear two different ones and the Halo always seems off by hours.,5
3325,"I usually like Amazon products, I own an Amazon tablet, the Echo Buds, Luna and a ton of Amazon Basics stuff but this one... Amazon are setting themselves up for failure.You can see in the forums, a ton of people can't set up the voice correctly, I've been having an issue since early October, I escalated it twice, and never received an answer. Either the engineers working on Halo are incompetent, or Amazon support are doing their best to make this product fail.The variety of workout program is a joke as well. I wouldn't pay for the service, not even 1 cent.The calorie and workout count could definitely be better.",1
3326,Great gift for my mom,5
3327,"1. it doesn't tell time ... fatal design flaw2. sleep tracking is not as accurate as fitbit (because I can tell by looking at both records for the same night)3. the body fat tracking requires you to take multiple pictures (using your camera) with only underwear, there's no way one person can do it and there's no way one can do it persistently4. tone analysis is extremely useless5. it's very hard to put it into the charging position6. I have very strong faith in Amazon and almost everything they sell, I bought this very early as a tester, but I can't stick with this product for more than two months",1
3328,I really was excited to get this tracker early. I use my Apple Watch all the time but was looking for something slimmer with different options. The tracker got really hot to the point it left red marks on my wrist no matter how loose I made the band. The accuracy of the watch was off by a lot from my Apple Watch. I wore one and each arm to check because it just felt like the Halo was off. I also didn’t feel comfortable with uploading my picture and question the  privacy of my information. I think with a little more time this will be a good band but it needs work. But for now really disappointed,1
3329,I was lucky enough to be a earlier purchaser of the Halo. It worked well for the first month or so but has now stopped working. I have charged it obviously but it fails to synch with the app.,2
3330,"I loved this product until it stopped charging. I had hoped maybe it was just the charger (which would still be frustrating since it's in perfect condition, but better than the band not working) but the lights on the band are no longer functioning either, which leads me to believe it is an issue with the band itself. It's totally useless to me now. I loved the sleep tracking feature and live heart rate tracking. The fitness tracking was hit or miss sometimes. Overall, I really liked it until now. Extremely disappointed. Don't waste your money.",1
3331,I live how it connects with my life insurance company and Weight Watchers. It's very accurate and keeps me on my toes,5
3332,Stopped working after about 2 months.  When it was working I thought it worked great however I could no longer get it to connect to my phone even after uninstall and reinstall it just stopped working.,2
3333,"Amazing!!! I love it so much.. the sleep tracking, voice analysis, and activity tracking are extremely accurate.. I haven't used the body comp feature yet",5
3334,I like my Halo band because it connects with my weight watchers app and tracks everything in one place.  I love it,5
3335,Don’t understand how it doesn’t monitor my sleep 3 out of 5 nights.  Battery full and paired to phone.  Only priblem,5
3336,"The device lacked any real benefit and was disappointing. I felt the tracking of movement and the voice analysis was misleading and incorrect, or vague. I had high hopes; however, I would not recommend it as a fitness tracker.",2
3337,"I'm only giving it a 2 vs. 1 because the body fat imagery feature is accurate and innovative. But, as a tracker, it falls short of many expectations. I don't think it's a good buy and was hoping the voice part was really cool.",2
3338,"I bought it a almost a year ago, I used it for a month and when I tried to charge it, I could not because the red light stay for hours and still no green light. I tried several times more but no charging at all.  I can see in the forums this is a common problem with this device.  Amazon should be recalling this product and issuing a refund. Do not buy it. Piece of trash",1
3339,Have been on the phone with the helpdesk several times so far and it still does not record anything and the phone keeps getting disconnected I will try one more time with the helpdesk and if this does not work it is going back!  love the theory but it should not be this difficult my watch I connected and it works now it's a lot more money but still hook up and works!,1
3340,I like the sleep tracking feature. The step tracking isn’t accurate but I think that is because I have it on my non-dominant wrist.,5
3341,The product did not last after 3 months.  I am sure this was done this on purpose so u buy another one.  damn scam.  I bought mine in January of 2022.  Be careful !!!!!!!,1
3342,Love it. It is a great. Works really bvb well. And the tone feature.,5
3343,So I was happy to get this  Halo band in the last  2 months just give up on me  it no work with the app  I reset it more the 10 times  register and deregister it  just  don't work so I have to go back to Fitbit hopefully Amazon come  with a better  version  or updated of Halo and sadly i cant returned because  window frame close back in January this year,1
3344,I dislike the fact that after owning this device fore a little over a year. It takes about 10 TIMES the amount of time to charge (4-8hrs Optimistically) and only charges to 43% always... LOVED DOES EVERYTHING like checking and comparing your heart rate to the previous day and week! GENIUS device in the first year. But everything battery performance wise was DOWN HILL!,1
3345,"I’ve had it just over a year and the device does not hold its charge any longer. Other devices I’ve had by other brands last for years. Support advises you to buy another which speaks to the quality of that is the standard response.When the device works, it works as advertised but not sure it’s worth the investment for folks with such a short working life.",1
3346,Enjoyed it for a few months and then it stopped synchronizing. It was worthless after that,2
3347,The fact that it doesn't have a screen makes this the perfect tracker for me. Or at least it should be. Unfortunately the tone recognition didn't activate most of the time oven with the most aggressive setting. Battery life was ok.,2
3348,"After about a month of wear, I noticed a pain on my wrist the other day. The band has burned the heck out of my wrist! Amazon wasn’t very helpful when I reached out about it - they kept punting me to different cs reps and saying they were connecting me to Halo support, but I didn’t get anywhere with them.I’ve worn an Apple Watch on my other wrist for several years and it’s never caused a problem or burn like this. Super painful and raw.The sleep tracking was useful, but not worth being in pain with a raw, burned wrist!",1
3349,"Purchased this early on before the public release. Coming from Amazon, the product is definitely underwhelming in many aspects.Battery life for a dayVoice Recognition not to parSleep Tracking seems to be very basic",2
3350,"This thing is buggy as hell. It seems like a nice idea, but only works 20% of the time. The app force quits every single time I open it, not being dramatic. Oh well. Hopefully they’ll give me a refund!",2
3351,I love my Halo. I wish the charging was easier though. The device is challenging to line up with the charger,5
3352,This is awful.  I purchased this tracker 6 months ago.  The app didn't auto renew my membership and won't let me restart the membership.  This is crazy.  I have had this less than a year and I can't access the features it offers.  I am very frustrated.  Do NOT buy this if you intend on using the app.,1
3353,It doesn't hold a charge I couldn't get a body scan to work. The sleep tracker is ok. It's just kinda useless really.,2
3354,Why do I have to login to an amazon acct if they dont save a profile?,1
3355,I really love my halo band is wonderful.,5
3356,I expected a lot from an Amazon product. The sleep and voice tone tracking do not seem very accurate. I will continue using the product a little longer but may not after the trial period.,2
3357,"Pros-app is good and easy to useCons-sizing instructions on site are inaccurate. Do NOT size up if you are in between sizes. Sleep feature is not as accurate as Fitbit, registers less sleep than I actually get. Tone feature was returning information during time that I was sleeping so unless I do a LOT of talking in my sleep, it was very faulty. Also, I had until the end of January to return OR replace but because it was for size they will not replace. I was instructed to reorder and pay a higher price. Very poor customer service. It is going back and I will stick with my Apple Watch.",1
3358,"Very disappointed by the product quality. After the lockdown, went to the swimming pool, and wanted to track my activity, double checked that we can swim with the device, but after 30 mins swim it was broken...",2
3359,"I have owned this band a little over a year.  Now my band will no longer pair with the app.  I reached out to Amazon.  After being passed around to about 4 different reps and following all the troubleshooting steps, the conclusion was that band is malfunctioning.  I was told the warranty expired so I would need to purchase a new one!  Beyond disappointed with Amazon with this one!!!!!",1
3360,Fitbit trackers do the same thing and allow for a clock on the band and sync with phone for call and text notifications,2
3361,"I love the device. I think that charging device could use some changes, takes some patience to get the connection.",5
3362,Unfortunately this product did not do a great job tracking steps not sleeping. Sleep tracking would be off by hours as well as steps tracking.  I was disappointed by the halo and it’s lack of accuracy.,2
3363,Easy to set up and use. Long battery life. Swim proof. Several pros.,5
3364,"Of all the fitness/life trackers I've owned, this one has been my favorite. Easy to use and the app really does provide great information with ease.",5
3365,"Charger stopped working. While it was working, it is extremely difficult to line up correctly on charger to actually get it to charge. Definitely a flawed design.",2
3366,Not that great. Doesn’t track more than a regular fitness band (other than the non-specific tone of voice info). This band would also be better with a face. Too expensive for what it is and does. I wouldn’t recommend.,2
3367,This health tracker gives excellent in-depth  feedback. Good battery life. Highly recommend.,5
3368,I love all the features this app and band offer.  Especially the sleep and activity tracker. The sleep stories really work.,5
3369,"I tried setting up the product, however instead of a blinking white light, the white light blinked three times and then stopped. Each time I have tried to set it up it has been the same thing. When I called customer service, they said to “watch YouTube videos”. This was extremely unhelpful as I have been totally unable to find any way to fix the device which I would like to keep given the amount of money spent. I was looking forward to using this, but I have been disappointed.",1
3370,"Technology just isn't there yet, and the membership price makes it totally not worth it",2
3371,Absolutely love the Halo. I bought it primarily to track my sleep and steps. Very comfortable and easy to use. Highly recommend,5
3372,Works very well. The only  thing is I have to keep pairing with my phone. Other than that I love it.,5
3373,I got this to track my sleep and was happy to see it would track my activity.  I work from home with a standing desk and treadmill.  I walk on the treadmill 4-6 hours per day and the activity tracker says I am sedentary.  Bottom line save your money.,1
3374,"Sleep tracking seems in accurate and completely bogus. There is no science to them detecting your sleep cycles based on your pulse data. Literally feels like they are simply guessing. It doesn’t accurately record sleep disturbances. It is uncomfortable to wear. The device falls out of the strap a lot. The app body shames you if you upload pictures, claiming that their artificial intelligence algorithms can take your picture and calculate a body fat percentage more accurately than a high tech bathroom smart scale. I sent the product back and even the return process was horrible, had to beg for my refund two weeks after it had been delivered to Amazon",1
3375,"Its nice when it works,  but when it fails you have to reset, loose all of your info and spend a couple of HOURS on the phone with Amazon trying to get assistance.  Mine has been replaced and failed again.",1
3376,"It is comfortable, holds a charge as long as you don't use the tone, love seeing how I slept!  I am happy with the Halo!",5
3377,Good band. It doesn’t distract you with displays or vibrations or other nonsense. The battery life is not what I would have wanted,5
3378,The sleep tracking mode helps me a lot since I don't always sleep well. I like all the suggestions to help improve my overall sleep,5
3379,"I really wanted to love this little device. I didn't care that there was no screen or nfc. It meant I wouldn't constantly be checking it. What it was designed to do i think it did with great accuracy.  But, a device that stops charging after only two weeks is a cause for concern. What else will stop working? I got in on the device early with an invitation. I returned it quickly when it wouldn't charge any more. Perhaps Amazon can fix this and/or the awkward way to charge it, but until then I'll stick with my $25 fitness tracker from China that keeps on plugging away.  Sorry, Amazon.",1
3380,The product is ok. I miss being able to look at my wrist/watch to tell the time. I wish it atleast vibrated with incoming calls. The sleep tracking is very accurate. The tone analysis really drains the battery,2
3381,"The halo is very good for tracing sleep, steps and body analysis.  I have not tried the voice application yet",5
3382,I'm super disappointed by the halo. It fell apart and now it doesn't even charge/connect. It was charging at first and connecting after the back piece popped off but now it doesn't. It looks like it charges but then when it comes to connecting it just doesn't. I bought it in hope of tracking my sleep and it was subpar at that. Save your money and buy something better.,1
3383,"Broke within weeks. Amazon sent a ""refurbished"" replacement that also doesn't work. We are trying to get a refund and Amazon knocked $20 off of the refund price because it's outside of the 30-day window.Total rip-off. Reasonable return policies are supposed to be the Amazon standard. Epic fail, Amazon.When it worked, the device was cool, but we are definitely being pushed into the arms of a competitor by this thoughtless, broken process.",1
3384,"I’ve stopped wearing my halo. All I learned was that I do not sleep well and I already knew that. The unit is a bit clunky and not comfortable to wear. I’m not interested in body fat so that metric doesn’t apply. I was waiting for updates as the promotional info I read mentioned future updates and added features, but no joy. Personally, I feel it was a waste of money for me. And I certainly won’t be paying the monthly fee. The halo did not meet my expectations.",1
3385,"Love it!  Easy fit, accurate sleep tracking and the tone feature is so useful!!  Mobile app is interactive with great pointers, classes, etc.",5
3386,I never was able to get Tone to work at all. Body was really difficult to get a complete scan. I loved the Sleep app and Activity was good as well.Not worth wearing the band. Will return.,2
3387,The body fat composition gives about 10% higher number compared to what I get from my annual hospitable routine check up. Very demotivating so I never use it. I only use it to track my deep sleep but I realized today that I was paying for the subscription. Halo band does not provide any unique features. If you already own a smart watch I would never buy it.,1
3388,"The first halo I Purchased was a special buy for about $60 it stopped working after a couple of weeks when I sent it back the price had changed to $90 I made up the difference and ordered a second one in less than a week if stoped working, I finally gave up I don’t want anything to do with that product, I ended up purchasing an amazing fitness watch for $28 it has heart monitor measures your blood pressure and many other fitness features and it’s rated Number three and the best fitness watches on the market.",1
3389,"My Halo was awesome while it worked!  I received it end of November and would no longer charge in the beginning of January.  I contacted customer service who did give me refund but when asked to have it replaced instead of a refund they said it would take 6 months to get new one.  Also when I went to return the accessories that I purchased with it, Amazon charged me $5.99 per item for return shipping fees even though returned in same order unless I drive it to Amazon drop box 45 minutes away.  This was the worst experience I have ever had with Amazon!!!",1
3390,"Does it allow members to connect with others through the fitness challenges, etc.?",5
3391,The product keeps its charge great. Only have to charge it once a week. It gets its charge back in 20 minutes.,5
3392,"So much more lightweight and comfortable than any other fitness watch I have owned (I previously had a fitbit versa, and a samsung 3 frontier)",5
3393,Love that I can use it for such a wide variety of activities...especially swimming. Not sure about the accuracy of counting steps.,5
3394,I like that the halo tracked my sleep and the voice and tone recognition was cool and an added bonus.,5
3395,I took my body fat measured three times in a row several times . Different readings each time .,1
3396,The sleep tracking and body scan features are excellent. I wish the app would play the videos on an echo show.,5
3397,I bought it specifically for the tone analysis and it's both accurate and very interesting/useful information to have.,5
3398,Very comfortable unlike other activity trackers I have used. Can actually wear this 24/7 without a sweaty wrist! App is fantastic! Love the Halo,5
3399,I like the simplicity of the tracker but I HATE THAT I CANT TRACK FOOD. It will only sync with Weight Watchers and im not about to get another plan to have them sync. 5/10 app needs some work.,2
3400,I am currently trying to cancel the membership so it does not auto renew.  I have tried this for a few months now and the features that are part of the subscription are not something I will use consistently.  I am currently on with customer service to try to make sure this will not auto renew as the app and website advises to do.  They say there is no way to cancel this and that there is no such thing as a membership.  In these trying times I am deeply troubled that something that states it will auto renew can not be cancelled.,1
3401,I wish there was atleast a clock on the watch. Overall I’m. I’m not impressed. It dies and i don’t realize it and i didn’t realize how much i would be let down that it doesn’t display time,2
3402,"I was really excited for this when I saw it coming out. It's similar in design and metrics as Whoop so I jumped on ordering it.I was really disappointed with the third-party apps, or lack of. You can't see the Halo app until you have one to sync, and there are only 2 apps that connect: Weight Watchers and John Hancock Vitality (what?). You can't sync the big hitters for your workouts: MyFitnessPal, MapMyFitness, Peloton, Stava, etc.I'm sticking with my Fitbit.",1
3403,The heart rate monitor was very off at times....especially when my heart rate was high.  Other machines clocked me in the 160s and the Halo would say 90-something.  I returned it.,2
3404,"The sleep tracking is verg accurate, the mobile app is so much more than 5 stars I really like it.",5
3405,I love the activity and sleep tracking on the halo!  The mobile app has cool workouts and programs too.,5
3406,There was a lapse in payment for the subscription for this device. Now the device is useless as you cannot sign up for a new subscription. A $100 purchase has become obsolete due to this.,1
3407,I really liked how it tracked the nintensity of workouts.  It would short time occasionally and I wasn't too concerned if the intensity level seemed low. The last time I used it I walked the track for 1: 15 and my readout was 19 minutes of low intensity and 56 minutes of sedentary activity. The sleep tracker never did work for me and I was told that the problem was being addressed. This was acceptable until the activity tracker also malfunctioned.,1
3408,"I was part of the first wave of the trial users & since purchasing this item, I have had severe difficulties with the poorly designed charging system. There was no clear documentation or answers as to if it was a physical issue with the band or charger, so I even went as far as to replacing the whole band (which is a mistake on my part).Overall, not worth the money. The sleep tracking is cool, though.",1
3409,"I received my Halo on June 22, 2021. I loved my Halo. It worked exactly as advertised. I had no trouble charging it or with battery life. On October 24, 2021 it stopped charging. I tried everything (cleaning the contacts, changing the wall outlet, changing the plug I put the USB into, bought a replacement charger).  Call me crazy but a product that costs this much should last more then 4 months.",1
3410,"I only wore it for a couple of days and hadn't tried out all of the features. On the third day of wearing it I went to take it off to recharge and it wasn't there, just the band.",2
3411,Doesn’t work as well as it advertises. Several glitches and problems need to be worked out,2
3412,"All in all, it sucks.  The design, is bad.  I guess battery life can be good at times, and sleep seems to track well, but, all of that is quickly forgotten, when you fiddle with the STUPID charger 'clip' they thought was a good idea for this thing.  No earthly idea why, but, that's what they went with.  Not a dock, not a magnet, not a mini usb, nope, a 'clip'.  AKA proprietary so that if it breaks, you have no choice but to get a new one from them.  Cool, Cool.",1
3413,"Love this!  Very user friendly app and interesting information about sleep.  Quick, long lasting charge.  So glad I got it!",5
3414,I love everything about it.,5
3415,"This product is not accurate with regards to fitness tracking or sleep. After a 30 minute workout, when in reality I burned about 200 cal, the app said I burn 1400. As for sleep, I’ve been struggling with insomnia since Covid and know that I only slept a couple of hours off and on throughout the night, The app calculated that I had a good nights sleep and rated it 83%. I was a walking zombie and could barely function. I’m going to throw it away.",1
3416,"This gadget is probably the worst, most inaccurate gadget on sale. If I sit in my car and drive, it gives me over 100 points of activity and tells me my heart rate was over 200 (I am glad I am still alive). If I play a 2-hours tennis match I barely get 6 (six) points of activity. When I measure my fat content, it goes from 15% one week, 18% the next, then down to 14%. Is that even physically possible? Do not buy, it is expensive and inaccurate.",1
3417,Love that it tracks how I sleep. Fighting a head cold so I don't get the full benefit of activity tracking. Can't get an accurate body fat measurement. Need to stand too far away from my phone,2
3418,"I got this as a Christmas gift. From the day I opened it, it did not work. If I tried to go to body comp the whole app would shut down. Everytime i tried to set up tone it would say it couldnt hear me.  I was on the phone with Amazon many times. Finally they sent a trouble ticket to the developers and Amazon called me back and said they wont work with an lg stylo 6!!!! She told me since i couldnt use it I could return it! To make matters worse... I had already sold my fitbit. So frustrated with Amazon!",1
3419,Step tracking is off.  I also have a Fitbit and this device reports about half of the steps.  Sleep score seems to match pretty well. Still evaluating other aspects.  Still pretty new.,2
3420,"Coming from a Jawbone, I was hopeful to find something comparable. The last I was able to use my Jawbone was 2016. Considering Amazon had 4 years to improve on this, they completely missed the mark.The only thing that works out of the box is sleep tracking and I happened to come across the hidden heart rate. Neither of these offer any substantial information and the sleep details are pretty much hidden.Too bad Jawbone went belly up, their 2015 tech is still superior and easy to use, not to mention the seamless integration into the Apple Health system...Hard pass on this terrible product.",1
3421,Helps me know how my tone comes across to others.  Keeps a great record of my sleep patterns.,5
3422,"No food/calorie tracking... you need another app to do that.  The lack of a device face is annoying... you have to take your phone with you to see your heart rate,  etc. No way to start a workout in the app - you have to remember what time you started and log it manually. You can log your weight only in full pounds... no ounces. The body fat scan gives inconsistent results and you can buy a body fat scale for the price of a year Halo subscription. The labs are basically ads. Get any other fitness tracker instead.",1
3423,The sleep tracking was incorrect on so many levels.  The steps don't seem correct either.  The mobile app is easy to use but unreliable.  I would not recommend this product.,2
3424,"My Halo suddenly stopped charging.  I thought it was the charging clip, so I ordered another one for $20, which came today and it's still not working.  I also dislike that since this is an Amazon product, there is virtually NO support, or means to get assistance or an exchange.  It has a 1 yr warranty, and I was liking it while it worked, but now what???  I wish I could ""contact the seller"" with questions or for assistance like I do with other products!!!",1
3425,"First Halo band quit charging after 4 months. I bought a new charging clip, that wasn't the issue. Tried all the online help until the battery died. Tried the online service, took 2 weeks to finally get someone who knew anything about the device. They sent me a second one, this one was refurbished and it's lasted 5 months. I actually liked everything about it. I will stick with Garmin products. Amazon should stick to selling things not designing and manufacturing them.",1
3426,"Still trying it out, but seems to be very accurate in tracking activity and sleep. Voice tone tracking seems a little 'beta' still.",5
3427,"I’ve been very disappointed with this band. It communicates with WW, but nothing else. Requires charging every other day, but struggles to stay on the charger. Would return, but I threw out the box.",2
3428,I love the halo! I tracks better than my Apple Watch,5
3429,Better than apple and Fitbit so far,5
3430,"Had some issues with the charging port, fixed them with the help of the excellent Amazon support team. Great customer service.",5
3431,Does a very accurate job of monitoring sleep tracking. Also I’m in customer service so the voice monitoring is awesome!,5
3432,"I'd say Amazon has a long way to go with this. I had it and it worked for 2 days then it disconnected from my Iphone and wouldn't reconnect. I did troubleshooting for 2 hours and finally decided not worth it. I did get it to pair again for 30 seconds then it said it was disconnected and I had to do it again. So frustrating. The equipment also feels very cheap, the band as well as the charger, cheap. The app its self looks good and is for sure designed for beginners and not more advanced athletes. I'm disappointed as typically Amazon products are high quality.",1
3433,Bought this product in December- the charger is/was terrible from the start.  Very difficult to get in the right spot.  Over time it got harder and harder until in May it stopped charging at all.  In less than 5 months the product was useless.  I contacted customer support and they shipped out a refurbished replacement that never could pair correctly with the app or my phone.  Out of sheer frustration I had to stop the whole process.  Save your money- Do not buy.,1
3434,"I think I wasted my money . The battery doesn't last long, and the speech recognition isn't good it doesn't work properlyAnd you need pay for some services .",2
3435,I have the Apple watch as well and I must say the Halo is more accurate and very comfortable on the wrist.,5
3436,"Sleep tracking says that my sleep is low quality when I wake up after a solid 8 hours feeling well rested.  Says same thing when I wake up after a 4 hour night.  Display shows large blocks of awake time that are inaccurate.Otherwise, the tracker is a pretty bland featureless piece of cloth to wear around your wrist.  No screen for even seeing the time.  It is cheap compared to FitBits, etc but not by enough to justify getting this.  Probably why it is already discounted (and probably soon to be discontinued ala other failed Amazon products).",1
3437,"I disliked that it tracks you. I don't trust the big companys like Amazon, as far as personal data. They want to use your voices to give you recommendations on how you sound to people or when your stressed. My question is what are you gonna use my voice or data for. I disliked this product, it's too much personal moments, time, ware abouts, favorite places, friends house, side piece house that they can gather from your information. There is a saying in things being too smart. Just don't want another tracking device in my life.",1
3438,I like my halo. I connected it with my WW app and it works great!A watch combination would be an awesome addition.,5
3439,"Ok. I threw this product in the trash a couple of weeks ago because that is where it belonged. Had trouble getting it charged and Amazon's ""help"" (LOL) on this product of theirs consisted of sending you to the same worthless pages over and over. No contact number. No email. Nothing. Buyer Beware!!",1
3440,Voice analysis way off.Sleep function took months to measure relatively accurately.Stopped charging after 3 monthsWhy wear a watch if it doesn't tell time?,2
3441,Absolutely love this product! I am learning a lot from it!,5
3442,"After five months of wearing, the plastic covering the back wore off and the tracker was unable to track any movement.",2
3443,I love the workouts and the sleep tracking. The programs help me to push myself to be a better person.,5
3444,Has refused to sync for two weeks.  Activity doesn’t recognize treadmill time.  Pretty worthless for supposed purpose.  Videos are sometimes helpful.,1
3445,This provides everything I need with little to no maintenence.,5
3446,The first one I had stopped charging after just 5 months and the replacement I received the device detached from the band and I did not realize it. It is attached by 2 rubber snaps which obviously are not very secure. I saw on the halo forum I was not the only one who had this issue. Amazon refused to stand by the product so I would not recommend wasting your money.,1
3447,Been on charge for two days and still red.Called support. They can't help.So now what? All that time wasted? What about my membership payments?? Do I get a refund??,2
3448,So after 4 months it no longer functions. It appears the glue holding the sensor on the back has started to come apart and it doesn’t measure anymore. This is the second time this has occurred with a fitness tracker device. I suppose I sweat too much for the glue to withstand rigorous use. Thus the sensor is no longer operational. Not sure why fitness trackers don’t expect sweating. We’ll time to give in and make the investment  with the fruit watch.... but I’ll be inspecting the sensor components before dropping hundreds of dollars.,1
3449,I loved the accuracy of the data . The Halo is precise down to the second.,5
3450,"i did not know what to expect, with this device, but it is pretty useful. i am glad i got it.",5
3451,"app set up had glitches, but I got it working within 24 hoursVery clunky set up. I got a new iPhone and could not transfer data. I could also not connect halo to my new iPhone. I total I think the halo wasted 3 hours of my life. Very frustrated with the entire process.I have not used it a ton yet, so my review is premature as far as the usage goes…. IF U CAN EVER GET IT SET UP!!!",1
3452,"Easy to use, sized perfectly for storage and works great!",5
3453,"I love it, the body scan feature as well as the sleep tracking are phenomenal. 10/10 would reccomend.",5
3454,"I switched to a Halo and it has had nothing but issues. Quit tracking so Amazon sent me another and I returned the broken device per Amazon instructions, but they never received it from the USPS, so charged me for the replacement which also is not working.. They have issuea, I usually live Amazon products but this time get another device.",1
3455,"Product has great potential but obviously there are major product issues. Warranty process is unnecessarily bureaucratic and not customer friendly. Latest Halo actually leaked some type of corrosive liquid on my wrist. Amazon has turned off the ability for me to write this review on my previous orders also, which I find very telling. This review portal would also NOT let me upload a photo of the skin damage from the leaking Halo.",1
3456,"I was excited about the product and what it was supposed to be able to do. I could not wait for the device to come in, charge it up, and try it out. I love how quickly the unit charges and easy to sync to my smartphone.Sadly, the product fails to track sleep and also has a very high heart rate than what my actual heart rate is by over 30 BPM. I had the heart rate monitor up at my last annual Dr. appointment and they verified the watch was counting my heart rate inaccurately.",1
3457,I really really wanted to love this...but I returned it. The way it rates your activities does not make any sense. And like other reviewers said it is very demotivating.,2
3458,"I bought the Halo band in November 2020.  It worked well at first and I was pleased with the way it tracked movement & sleep.  A couple of months ago it started having pairing issues with the app and recently it just stopped working altogether. I passed the window to receive support on this device in May.  Basically I paid $60 (a special trial deal) for a fitness tracker that lasted around 6 months.  Do better, Amazon.",1
3459,I was really disappointed by my Halo. The battery doesn't last very long at all and I'm constantly having to enter my activity in manually. I will not be renewing my subscription.,2
3460,Sleep recognition fails utterly when you get up and then go back to sleep.,2
3461,"I was excited to get it, However could not get it to set up. Returned it received another one it did not work either. Too bad wanted to use it.",2
3462,"After a month, i can easily say that there is nothing special about it.",2
3463,the voice tracking is the main reason i bought it & it's the weakest feature. kills the battery.  minimal detail. misses most conversations during the day,2
3464,"i sent this back because it did not really do anything for me. there are no screens, no alerts, no motivation features to help improve. it is just a very basic tracker.",2
3465,I like many of the functionalities of the Amazon Halo.  The sleep tracking has been especially helpful for me.,5
3466,"The sleep tracking on this device is horrifically inaccurate regardless of when you sleep.The app is busy and informative but given the degree of inaccuracy of the tracker, itself, it should allow for more manual edits/adjustments…I bought this to replace my Fitbit and as an alternative to Apple - If you’re price sensitive, stay w Fitbit.",1
3467,Absolutely love this! Has given such insight into my sleep patterns!! Tracks my steps more accurately than my Apple Watch! Loves it!!,5
3468,Really cool product. Replaces my Whoop strap and then some.,5
3469,I returned this a day after receiving. It was not comfortable for me.,2
3470,"Never tracked my sleep. i gave it a chance but nothing. Had to return it. and if you take a pic of your body, you might be discouraged cuz it makes you look horrible.. I recommend the FITBIT , works wonders and tracks Naps as well.",1
3471,"I’m so impressed with this item, the app has no issues, it actually knows how long you sleep for. It’s amazing.",5
3472,"Unobtrusive to wear, lasts a few days per charge, tracks my sleep and daily movement. Very pleased with my Halo.",5
3473,"This device is a horrible product, all around. I was part of the pre release trial, and the device is not only extremely creepy and unsettling in how it functions, but the subscription model, lack of features, and creepy features that do exist on the device do not make this product any better. Everyone that asks about this creepy fitness tracker, says they are usually uncomfortable with the device listening to our conversations. I agree.Garbage. I’m contacting Amazon to see about a return. And I didn’t even pay full price for it that’s to the pre release trial.",1
3474,"I wanted to like it, I really did. I tried for a month to get it to work properly, but frequent connection issues requiring total reinstalls made it frustrating. Additionally, the body scan is total crap. I’ve been losing significant amounts of bodyfat over the last month and it registers muscle as fat, stating that I’m gaining vs losing it. Additionally, Icouldnt figure out how to update weight, etc. , so the app has some serious issues. I’d wait until they fix this as I wasted $80 in the preview and am not apt to try new tech from Amazon again.",1
3475,"I got this device as a gift from my husband. So far, it is very inaccurate. I know for a fact that I have done several I tense workouts and it gives me 0 points.  On top of all even though  I have a very active job and it still takes out points when I sit down. The voice recognition is impossible to set up. The only good thing I have to say about it is that it has a great sleep tracker, bit my Vivofit 3 does that pretty good too, so I'm very disappointed with this product.",1
3476,Love the simplistic approach to this.  Accurate tracking and the tone analysis is also a great feature!,5
3477,My gf loves this. She uses everyday all day. She loves using the app which helps with meditation/ yoga/ stress/ managing.,5
3478,This band is great. It does everything you need. The problem I had was because after three months of using it it stoped working. I got one for my daughter about a month after I got mine and that one broke down too. The app is great though.,1
3479,"I have had this watch for 3 days now and I have to charge it twice a day, there is 2 hours a day I cannot use a watch that is recommended for frequent use.",2
3480,After a year the tracker doesn’t work and there is not support at all. I am trying to talk to somebody to know why I cannot sync it with my phone. I have sent a couple of emails to customer support and nobody never answered. Really disappointed to pay all that money for something that doesn’t last,1
3481,"This is awful to charge. Does not fit well into the charging doc.After wearing this for three months I have found it almost useless. I was expecting specific feedback on how to improve my sleep, be more active throughout the day, and be more peaceful. Instead I received generic recommendations for programs to try. When programs did not give the desired outcome, halo did not change the recommendations.Honestly the tips given by halo are like the generic solutions you receive on google search.Headspace videos are redundant.Don't buy this",1
3482,"Great looking, great price, nice app and awesome features. But not very accurate as others are claiming. I wished it was more accurate as I love the styling. Does not use GPS so just moving your arms counts as steps, calories burned are based on a formula that uses number of steps, so garbage in, garbage out.",1
3483,It’s not what I expected. It doesn’t track steps completely. The battery doesn’t last long enough. I don’t really like the fact that it doesn’t keep/show time. There’s no reminders if you don’t move enough.,2
3484,I like this as it’s simply a health tool and I can focus on improving my scores,5
3485,Wonderful app and tracks your sleep and how you react with people.,5
3486,This is a piece of crap!  I bought this as a gift for my mom and it stopped working right after the return period ended!  Now I had to go back to fitbit which I know is reliable and will stand the test of time.I am So disappointed and embarrassed that I gave this as a gift.,1
3487,"Not sure if the band itself can be replaced.  Using everyday, I think the band will show its dirt/use.",5
3488,i need the paperwork to send back the hola band,5
3489,This works very well and works as expected with no issues.,5
3490,I have been wearing smart watches for a long time. This device chafs and irritates my wrist and really doesn't seem to provide any added benefit than other watches out there. Disappointed 😞,2
3491,It works so well my boyfriend wanted one for sleeping. His doctor is loves it as well,5
3492,"I went on a 3 hour walk and it said I got 3000 steps and then I contacted chat support and factory reset the band as it said then went on another walk over 3 hours and 8 miles long and it says I got less than 5000 steps, completely inaccurate step counting, returning this device for a fitbit",1
3493,"I tried it for a year. It has been a disappointing and I finally decided to discard it - last time I felt being 'cheated' was the discontinued Amazon Look. Again, there were too many experimental features and did not work well. It could be much more useful if Amazon would allow the data to be shared with other mainstream apps such as apple health.",1
3494,"It’s kind of cool at first, but do I really care after about a month what my sleep quality is? I was there, I know what my sleep quality was. The tone thing was amusing, but that got old quick. Most of all, I wanted it for the body fat tracking and I was pissed that I would have to take a picture. I thought it was more scientific than that. If you feel out of shape, the last thing you want to do is put a bikini on and take a picture.Overall, I think it’s a waste of money.",1
3495,"Fascinating Tracking Of Your Activities, Sleep & Downtime. Good Product!",5
3496,Mood feature doesn’t work.  Wrist hurt if I wear it too long.  Lack of feedback on the device makes it hard to track progress etc unlike the Apple Watch.,2
3497,"The band works fine the 1st year. With suscription the product is good, without that is worst that Xiaomi band.",1
3498,"I had high hopes for the Halo but after wasting a heck of a lot of money and time with it, I'm now back to Fitbit. The Halo NEVER worked properly for me. Having something with a one-button only access with no readout is ridiculous. If the button doesn't work properly, you're screwed. And Amazon putting out something that doesn't work with Fire tablets makes as much sense as Apple putting out a product that doesn't work with iOS. Ended up spending 120 bucks on two versions of the product--money wasted. Buyer beware!",1
3499,Sleep and voice features never accurate or effective.  According to Halo I never sleep.  Thought the video imaging function might show promise over time.,2
3500,"It is very comfortable to use, you forget that you have it on and it says is very accurate",5
3501,"Love the sleeping tracking feature and the activity tracking feature as well. Pretty accurate, no red flags yet.",5
3502,I've had it for less than 6 months and it is no longer tracking sleep. It doesn't sync sleep data to ww.,2
3503,I bought this as a cheaper alternative to similar products and it turned out to be a huge disappointment. One day it just unpaired from my iPhone and nothing could get it to pair again. I followed the instructions to the comma. The lesson for me is to never ever buy the cheaper options when it comes to these devices. It's just a waste of money and time.,1
3504,I want to love it but it doesn't do it's 1 maim function and that is to track my steps and activity. It's off by thousands of steps every day. I have gone through all their trouble shooting suggestions and they say just track it manually. I bought a device that was supposed to do that for me.,1
3505,"It works well. Glad I got it, definitely had a few flaws with battery and pairing, but its still early access",5
3506,"They say the benefit of the Halo is that you aren't distracted by a watch screen and so it's easier to use. What they don't say is that it stops working after a month or so. It won't sync in the halo app, it won't reconnect, the sleep tracker stops displaying sleep info, and then it won't factory reset, and they don't offer any support or return options or unsubscribe. The best thing to do now is to throw it out the window. Hopefully, it can be used to line a bird's nest.",1
3507,"The halo band's sensor stopped working! The back cover fell off one day, I tried taping it up. Worked for another week, but now doesn't charge or sense anymore. And I can not find any support anywhere.I have used cheaper bands before that last longer!",1
3508,It’s been a great addition for what I needed,5
3509,Bought this in october 2020.. Loved it in the beginning but after 60 days it just stopped working..won't charge...won't come on.. Have tried everything... No one will respind to my questions.. Have bought a new charger still dont work...really wish this would of kept going... But with no support and no one will help you when you have issues with it.. I would Honestly give this less than a 1 star...,1
3510,I would pass on this product. The voice analysis doesn’t make it worth the money plus you have to pay for the app long run.,2
3511,It is small & often goes unnoticed. I forget that I'm even wearing it at times.,5
3512,"Body composition is seriously flawed.  I have down calipers, army and navy body fat test, and a withings scale these place me at 12-13% body fat.  Additionally my doctor has me at sub 15% which matches to a general, human eye, comparison and rating.  Halo has me at 21%.  I am a bulky lifter have top abs revealed and onliques starting to pop.  Waste of time and money and I am going to return it.",1
3513,I like the body fat scans and daily point tracking features. The tone feature I decided to turn off.,5
3514,I love my Halo so far. Very useful and comfortable.,5
3515,I purchased this for the tone detection feature but that never works. Unless I hold the button and deliberately make a recording it doesn't record a damn thing. And while the other features are a lot more useful to me than fitbits the app is very hard to figure out and I'm returning it because I'm tired of wasting my time,1
3516,"Wow. Bought this for my wife and let me just say: it sucks! I could have bought a Fitbit for around the same price and that would actually track her workouts! She’s done a workout every day with this thing and has had to manually input her activity. It didn’t track a couple nights of sleep, and the setup in and of itself was crap too! Amazon needs its money back from these developers and I need my money back for this piece of garbage!",1
3517,Syncing with my iphone has been impossible. Basically it’s been tossed in a junk drawer.,1
3518,"Amazon had to send a replacement device when the first one didn't work at all.First device:- charged well once I was able to get it onto the dock (such a hassle)- never tracked my sleep or movement or voice- only registered my heart rateSecond device:- charged inconsistently and struggled to get it onto the dock- never tracked my sleep- registered my heart rate- sporadically tracked my movement- captured 2 seconds of audio recording at a time, even when button was activated to test it out.HUGE FAIL.",1
3519,"I bought a bracelet, but in my country I cannot download the app. There was no warning about this ((((",5
3520,"Liked it at first, but battery life didn’t last 9 hours. Frustrating when you want to use it during the day and track sleeping at night.Fitbit lasts 5-7 days",2
3521,"I wanted a better activity/sleep tracker, and the Halo certainly does that. My beef is that there is NO DATA on the device at all; everything is on the app. Good data, no problem, but I don't always want to pick up my phone to see how many steps I have for the day. Also, I am a WW member and wanted to sync with my WW app; I have good activity syncing, but the sleep numbers/scores do not sync. I like the band, the fit, etc., but I really wish I had bought a new Fitbit.",1
3522,"I like the functionality of the product, but I realized I don’t like just wearing a band. Wish it was a clock or something. Also the band gets dirty fast.",2
3523,"First I was looking forward to the halo to keep me motivated. When I received my first halo I enjoyed it and it did motivate me. However, after a month it started giving problems in which the technical assistance at Amazon couldn’t get to work.  Therefore, I received a new one again I had problems and I had to return the halo after three weeks.  My third replacement came and it lasted only two weeks.  Therefore, I requested a refund in which I received quickly.",1
3524,I absolutely love this product!  The app had way more than I expected. I 100% recommend this product!!,5
3525,"Honestly I loved the band when I got it.  Now it won't sync to the app.  Everytime I try to sync is closes the app and does not sync.  I even have it set up to sync on the hour.  Nothing.  I've tried all the fixes and nothing works.  Makes this 100$ band worthless.  And I noticed the problems started right around the time I stopped being a ""member""",1
3526,Charger was faulty since the day I got it ! I got a full exchange for my item because the item it self didn’t work! Now my item works but the charger sucks and my band broke after 4 weeks,1
3527,would be nice to see the app integrate with healthkit and provide more graphical long term analytics,5
3528,Although I have not tried all of what halo is able to do I love it.,5
3529,I love seeing how long I was sleeping. I disliked the body scanning. It takes too long to perform.,5
3530,"Good product when it works. Have to return. Had it for about a month, probably disconnects every other day. No indication, no reason as to why it disconnects.",2
3531,The Halo works great. The sleep tracker really works for those of us that sleep in the daytime.,5
3532,"I primarily use my watch for tracking NEAT and making sure I'm not too sedentary. The watch itself does a great job of tracking everything, but the app is SOOOOOO slow at loading and updating everything that it's painful to even look at the data. I LOATHE the app. It feels like Amazon decided to equip the app with way too many functionalities before ensuring that the base functions even work properly. If they get the app working right, I would definitely recommend the watch...But for now, I'd look elsewhere for a fitness wearable.",1
3533,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Very stylish, very much comfortable!! I don't even know it's on my wrist! Great features. Accurate tracking. Battery Life!!!!! Not good enough",5
3534,Love this thing so far. The app is extremely easy to use and has so many cool features.,5
3535,"The only thing it was really good for was monitoring my heart rate and tracking my steps ( I think the pedometer feature is inaccurate). I like the body fat measurement feature; conversely there was really no point, because that’s more of an App feature that doesn’t require the device. The device doesn’t do much... it can’t even tell time. Mine actually stopped working after a brief hiatus. So it’s basically a piece of junk. And this is coming from a person with an obsolete Apple Watch. I guess I’ll be returning to the dark side.",1
3536,Its perfect!  Just as described.,5
3537,"Body fat % was not accurate, activity and heart rate not tracked properly for many common exercise activities.",2
3538,This product was extremely uncomfortable to wear. I left my wrist feeling very sore after a week of wearing it (even after i had loosened the strap). There is no screen on the item therefore you can't monitor your measurements without pulling out your phone and using the app ( a huge drawback in my view). My Samsung watch is vastly superior. Not recommend.,1
3539,It is definitely the most interesting wearable on the market right now. I’m sure the next generation will be incredible.,5
3540,Was good until it started running out of charge after 8 or 9 hours. Originally it lasted for close to 30 hours!!,2
3541,"I love Everything about it, it’s perfect hope more features come! Must have!! The band is strong and comfy",5
3542,"Returning item. Causing a burn and or some type of irritation to skin. Never had issue before. If I continue to wear, the worse it gets.",2
3543,"The metal in the band made me skin have a rash. I dont normally have sensitive skin,  so wearing this 24/7 is not an option.",2
3544,"Do not buy this product. I got it as a gift for Christmas and by June of 2021 my charger was not working. Last week I was doing routine yard work and the device fell off of the band and is gone. This  product works well on the surface but the design of the device and how it connects to the band are horrible. Also, the charger is not reliable.",1
3545,"I received a burn literally in the shape of the actual tracker part on my wrist. It took almost a week to heal and then it completely stopped charging. I have tried everything, including my moms charger and nothing. My moms works on both chargers though. Unfortunately I am well outside of the return window. Will be getting a different fitness tracker!",1
3546,I have ordered two different halo bands and neither of them have connected to my iPhone. I had my phone looked at and also contacted Amazon and nobody could help get it fixed. I will be returning to my Apple Watch and unfortunately giving up on the halo band.,1
3547,"I’m really disappointed in the Halo product.  I wore an Apple Watch and a Fitbit for the last month to compare. The Apple Watch and the Fitbit were comparable in their measurements. The Halo was miles apart for steps, heart rate and sleep. When I did the scan it said I was 28% fat. I’m 5’9” and 135 pounds. So Halo got that seriously wrong as well. I hope Amazon does something to fix these issues and not punish those of us who were early adopters by releasing a Halo 2 as a fix. I would be extremely unhappy.",1
3548,"Most of what Halo does, other trackers do as well or better.  Had to stop wearing it due to the sharp edges of the device hurt my wrist.",2
3549,I really wanted to love this but didn’t. By the time I had used it and realized it just wasn’t for me it was too late to return.,2
3550,Wants what I thought it was going to be.  Accuracy with heart rate was way different comparted to apple watch while doing certain activities.,2
3551,"The band worked great at the beginning.  Now I am at month 5 and the band will NOT stay connected. I had to regularly factory reset the band and pair.  Now, I can't get it to pair no matter if I factory reset or not.  I try to reach out to support and get no help.",1
3552,I returned the first Halo because the heart rate monitor was up to 60BPM off with the replacement I had the same problem after a call to tech support I never heard back from the developers. The main reason I bought this was to train using the HR. I’m going with a Fitbit. I use a polar chest strap and the halo but the Halo was not even close to the Polar H10,1
3553,I love how accurately it records my sleep patterns. Makes me more cognizant as to how I’m sleeping.,5
3554,Band stopped syncing after 60 days. Have tried all the troubleshooting steps with no luck. Amazon may need to work out some bugs before releasing this to the market. Disappointing.,2
3555,So far so good and I am impressed! Looking forward to the future and more updates to come.,5
3556,I loved the product until the battery stopped charging!  Of course I encountered an issue just AFTER the product support window closed.  This is horrible customer service and I would expect that an economic engine like Amazon seeking to launch a successful wearables product would have the sense to at least provide support / warranty of at least 1 Yr. Very disappointed with my purchase and with Amazon.,1
3557,"This face less system is a nice idea. I'm not allowed to wear a smart watch at work because of possible distraction, however the step counter is totally inaccurate. Thousands of steps are added while driving long distances. For that I give this product 1 star.",1
3558,Liked the workout videos and the sleep info,5
3559,"Really disappointed in this product. I’ve had it for for almost 2 months and the data and tracking continues to be in accurate. I’ve worn it to hiit training classes that are an hour long and it says I only did moderate activity for 1 minute sometimes. The body scan frequently tells me I have a dangerously high body fat % that can lead to health issues but compared to the body scans I’ve had else where, the numbers are opposite. Wish they’d either update the software or provide a refund",1
3560,Pretty cool. Not exactly confident in its accuracy so far. But great support staff trying to imrove it overall.,5
3561,Amazon advertises all of these great functions that you can use with the Halo but fail to inform you that you can't use most of them without monthly membership. Just get a fit bit. It might be a little bit pricier upfront but you get the same plus more and pay less for it in the long run,1
3562,"if you're looking for a lifestyle tracker, this is isn't the answer. The only thing it does well is track your current heart rate.",2
3563,Doesn’t give miles or distance traveled!,2
3564,For me it a good device. But a subscription after the free is no way cool. I want to cancel it asap once my free trial ends.,2
3565,The product worked fine for about 3 weeks and then stopped working.,2
3566,It wasn’t for me. It irritated my wrist very badly. It was more annoying than anything. I didn’t think it was comfortable to wear.,2
3567,I absolutely hated this! The first one I was sent burnt my arm! I was sent another and I really tried but the sleep monitor was way off the tracking was right half the time. I did like the app it was encouraging and I also liked how it gave me my body fat percentage. The battery life was short and even though I was told it would be replaced it wasn't. As far as the tone monitoring I think that was a joke. I really wanted this to work but it just wasn't for me.,1
3568,"Multiple inconsistent measurements,Great ‘concept’ sadly, inaccurate  measurements…Returning",2
3569,"I like the concept, but am not impressed with the accuracy nor the ""point"" system.  I rolled the dice on this, but I ""crapped out"".",2
3570,"Really had high hopes for this device, but the app doesn't work right. Body scan is not very accurate and now no longer works at all... figures this would happen the day after the window to return closed. Reached out to customer service, but nothing they suggested fixed the issue. Do yourself a favor and get something better. I also very much dislike that there isn't a clock or face screen on the band. I get what they are trying to do, but in my opinion this is a fail. Do better Amazon.",1
3571,"Set up was easy, charged the band for 3 hours then went to bed wearing it, in the morning woke up to  ""Your band is not connected, double hit the button to connect"".  Double hit the button and nothing, rebooted phone, nothing, restarted bluetooth to scan, nothing. Called customer service who said well you only get 2 days of battery if tone is set up, tone isn't setup so i should get 7 days of battery right?  I didn't even get 17 hours out of it. Worthless junk, returning this until they figure out the bugs.",1
3572,I am really enjoying...using all aspects with app.,5
3573,"I bought the Halo when it first came out. The product arrived and could not be synced on bluetooth. I spent more than an hour on a support call, which still didn't fix it. I asked for a replacement which took months. When it finally came, it did not sync, and it's just not worth hours of time online to fix. It lies in a drawer, and will go to the dump very soon.",1
3574,"Purchased it in Dec'2020 when it was released and now the battery holds for less than an hour. I liked the product, sleep tracking is an highlight for me but now it is dead.  Contacted amazon support hoping still covered under warranty but I believe the warranty/return window is only for 30 days after purchase. I suggest purchasing an additional warranty if you plan to use it every day.",1
3575,"Does not track most workouts including high intensity workouts. Sleep tracking is alright but only if you sleep more than 4 hours, short naps don’t get recorded.",2
3576,The Whoop is much more comfortable. Voice recognition does not work that great,2
3577,Band won't stay connected to phone /app. Resync is terrible.,1
3578,With no display it is way behind other devices in the market. App has too many things and the user interface is messy,2
3579,"Oh man!! I was so stoked for this! I LOVE that it doesn't have a watch face/ display. The look of it was cool! Was hoping it would be an affordable Whoop Band because I'm a data junky - but the data you get is so basic - no way to adjust goals and felt so inaccurate. The voice monitoring was terrible because it picked up everyone else but me.This is honestly just a ""fancy"" pedometer and I use ""fancy"" VERY loosely. Returned this so fast.",1
3580,It’s scary sometimes lol,5
3581,It did not connect in order to read messages like the cheaper products. The sync was off and unjust thought for this price it should be more accurate.,2
3582,"I am beyond perplexed with this item.  Thank goodness I received it as a gift from Weight Watchers so it didn't cost me anything but this thing work for about a week.  I used the trouble shooting process several times with no results. Can't get a hold of anyone to help.  Can't even send it back to have it replaced.  Stay away from this item buy with a proven tracker, either FitBit or Apple This thing is junk and the customer support is non-existent.",1
3583,Difficult to keep it charged sorta gave up on it,2
3584,"I was excited to try another fitness tracker after many years of a Fitbit. I was sadly disappointed after the first week of wearing the ""halo"".",2
3585,"I had high hope's, I was overall disappointed. The app itself has some great features and tools. The device on the other hand has noting great to talk about. First off for bad, in the world of usb charging devices, why Amazon did you go custom charger? And its difficult to line up to charge. You also have to charge every 2 days. The device is bulky in its stance. Thinner wider would have been better. I'm glad I got in on the beta order so I didn't waste 99.00 on it.",1
3586,like the sleep part a lot,5
3587,"Original: The mic on mine no longer picks up sound or it just stopped syncing voice data.  I've only had it a couple of weeks.UPDATED:  After this review I was contacted by Amazon to help solve the problem.  They eventually sent me a new device (after 1st sending me a refurbished).  The same issue has occurred again.  Device is synced, membership active, mic on, device fully charged.  Either the mics are faulty or they aren't uploading their data to the app OR the app isn't displaying it.",1
3588,"I had high hopes for this. Not for me. The battery life is awful, especially using the voice sense. Needed charged daily or every other day. Most frustrating, it assumes you are dead if you aren’t wearing it, so it only counts your calories burned while wearing it. Also the cloth band gets disgusting and of course there is no watch face, which while I knew that when I bought it, it irritates me more than I even thought",1
3589,Does not track sleep properly if you work 3rd shift. steps are accurate Body fat is off by a fair amount (doesnt do muscle properly) not customizable,2
3590,Does not keep even close accurate heart rate. Hate this about it. I do not recommend if you are using it for workout reasons,2
3591,This thing is amazing if your a person that like to analyse your results,5
3592,had band for a short time and quickly became unable to recharge. I went on line and found this was a common issue,2
3593,"I was so excited to get this, but returned it after about 2 hours of having it. The blush pink looks like a gauze wrapped around your wrist. I thought this would be sleek, but it’s very bulky and so uncomfortable. Looks so cheap. Not sure how it actually works because the app is incredibly laggy and unstable. After fully charging it (I had to keep adjusting and resetting it for it to hold a charge because it kept disconnecting), I spent a good 45 minutes just trying to connect the device to the app.",1
3594,"Update Jan 15th: deducted another point. Bought a new phone and it has been a nightmare to get it to pair. The band is refusing to light up except on the charger, green light only. Not worth it.Not impressed. Turned off Tone after the first few days as it was sucking up the battery life. It deducts points for sitting too long, an unfortunate part of my job but it doesn’t provide any motivation or reminder to get up and move. I was hoping for a better fitness tracker, this sadly is not it.",1
3595,"I was so excited for this, and very, very quickly let down.  It took over a month to arrive, and that was just the beginning. My chief complaint is lack of consistency in the monitoring.  The device repeatedly stops monitoring despite being connected and worn correctly. I will miss hours of data at a time, and then all of a sudden it works fine. I tried for a couple weeks, and gave up.",1
3596,day 2 but I can see where it's going...motivated,5
3597,"I truly regret buying this compared to Halo view.The Voice recognition feature is not useful, because it drains your battery in one dayWhen the subscription expires, the only feature left seems just how long you sleep and your heart rate, and how many calories you used each dayHalo view seems a much better deal",1
3598,I’m a pretty fit person and I regularly check my body fat. This thing is way off and high! Be warned it is not accurate!!!,2
3599,Device became defective after 7 months. Device died and would not charge again. I was within the 12 month warranty period but amazon would not replace the device. I was granted a refund but the refund was for the early adopter price ($68) and not the current price tag of $99. Thus a refund doesn’t even allow me to purchase a new one. I’ll be switching to an apple watch.,1
3600,"My device died just a few days after product support ended, which is only 6 months. My husbands fitbit that was purchased at the same time is still going strong and has more free features. My unit specifically stopped charging. I tried cleaning all the contacts, shifting the device around gently, to no avail.",1
3601,Just starting wearing the halo. Nice product with lots of information to help a person stay healthy,5
3602,The design is a joke people have round wrists why is it a block on the bottom. Its uncomfortable it slides down my arm Just wait till you try and return it and you cant use normal return process i had to actually bring it to a amazon warehouse with horrible operating hours they are making actually making me deliver it to them,1
3603,"It counts only steps. No stairs. The sleep is extremely inaccurate. Pretty much if you sit and watch a movie it thinks you're sleeping.If you switch phones and have to pair, it's a nightmare. Took me an hour and having to factory reset.The band is super comfortable. That's the only pro.I'll definitely go back to fitbit",1
3604,"They all work great, the sleep tracks better then any other that I e tried.",5
3605,Not bad. Hope it continues to evolve.,5
3606,like I get it's trying to be discreet and look like a bracelet but having a watch on my wrist is so convenient t and if they could just have a dim lit clock setting as a watch that u could turn on and off it would  change everything about this device. i returned it within days of wearing. not worth it for me.,1
3607,It worked well for 10 days. I woke up the one day and it was no longer tracking. I couldn’t sync it anymore. I tried resetting it and even redownloaded the app and tried to pair it but nothing works.,1
3608,"I’ve had nothing but problems with this band. Constant issues with syncing, becomes unsynced and double tapping does nothing, have had to reset the band several times and done a factory reset that helped for a couple weeks but has been a headache ever since. Not worth the money at all which is a bummer because when it does work, I like it a lot.",1
3609,"There's simply no need.  I understood the limitations of the device when signing up for the pilot program and was STILL disappointed.  The tone of voice thing is interesting for about five minutes.  Activity and sleep were accurate (I wore my fitbit ionic as well, to compare the two), but the usefulness ended there.  The device was bulky, looked cheap, and needed to be charged constantly with tone of voice turned on.  I stopped wearing after about three weeks, and don't plan on wearing again.",1
3610,I disliked How much charge the device had . It would only work for 2 hrs and then stop and turn off .,2
3611,I actually enjoyed this band a lot but it has only lasted 6 months. The black piece on the back covering the censor fell off. Surprised to see there isn’t even a year warranty ESPECIALLY when you pay monthly for the app. I guess I will be headed to Whoop.,1
3612,I hadn't put the band on in over 2 weeks and I charged it up and I put it on the car seat and it said 0 steps  and when I put it on it said 30 steps 🚶‍♂️ how can I take 30 steps ridding in the car and I compared it to my samsung gear watch on the steps its about 1000 steps off the steps are not accurate at all it was a good concept but some parts are good and some are not,1
3613,I was hopeful that this would be helpful in my daily activities however it was not. The halo band that I received did not connect to my Apple phone. I tired multiple times and had to keep setting it to factory settings to connect as the instructions stated. It was frustrating how difficult it was and after all that still no connection. I believe the item I received was defective.,1
3614,I like it lot but it doesn’t last beyond three months. Amazon replaced three times ( with refurbished bands) and now I am out of warranty period. It’s charged but doesn’t switch on or connect with phone. Very disappointing,1
3615,I wish it didn’t have to fit tight,5
3616,Sleep had been way off many nights. Not sure it gives me enough insight and data as I want in many areas.,2
3617,I really wish that it had a watch! I like to time things and I really didn't want to have my phone out.,2
3618,"Device never syncs. Be prepared to waste hours every week restarting your device, wiping it off the app and then pairing it again with factory reset. I guess that’s how Amazon solves the problem, just completely wipe out your data and reset a million times. Google it. Major waste of money. Doesn’t compete with other fitness trackers in any way.",1
3619,"Kinda blah. Went back to a garmin because it works with third party apps, and breaks down the data better. No monthly fee.",2
3620,Sleep app was very accurate the voice recognition doesn’t measure as accurate as it should.,5
3621,Gives skin rash. Needs to charge every 3 days or so - terrible charging device. Crapped out after a year and a half. Won't charge anymore. Not worth the money and the $4 a month. Canceled my subscription.,1
3622,I use this product to keep track of my daily lifestyle and to make healthy choices,5
3623,"So my first one wouldn’t stay charged long, new one can’t get to do anything at all.",2
3624,"When it is connected to my phone, all my text messages are not received until I restart my phone.  The body fat calculator/scanner told me my body fat went up after I lost 8 lbs. Sleep tracker is totally inaccurate I have compared it to one that actually works as it should and the results were WAY off. I tried to return it early on and it was not accepted so now it just sits in a drawer. Sad.",1
3625,"Just as with any other wrist based heart rate monitor, it is not accurate. The most accurate measures are chest straps and finger devices. No screen, says I was sleeping when I was not, overall, it is useless compared to any of my Garmin devices and my Apple Watch. The device was a nice try by Amazon and may be nice for those who do not use other similar devices, but it did not offer anything new, interesting, innovative, exciting, or anything.",1
3626,"I've had a GoBe by HealBe now for 5 years, it tracks calories in and calories burned, sleep, stress, heart beats, steps etc. I'm sure for some the Halo would be perfect and offer some added extras that other fit trackers don't. It's just not for me. The elastic wrist band gets filthy which I'm sure I could throw in the laundry and the plastic wristband I got caused me to itch terribly. I guess it's all what you're used to and what you're looking to monitor.",1
3627,This product is not worth the money. Don’t buy if you can avoid it,2
3628,"There really isn't much to like about the Halo.  It's like a smart watch that doesn't tell time.  You have to keep it on your wrist all the time if you want to get sleep information and it's not really that comfortable to wear all the time.  The body composition feature is somewhat useful, but not useful enough to wear it 100% of the time.  Amazon should just turn it into a smart watch so you don't have to wear two devices.  I returned it.",1
3629,Love it.  If trying to lose weight halo is the item to buy.,5
3630,It didn't do as much as I thought it would and the features it does have are not very accurate.,2
3631,Works great and serves my purposes.,5
3632,1 star because I like the ideaOtherwise it has so many problems syncing and keeping data. I'm on my third day of factory restarting it. It would randomly lose a day's worth of data like I didnt do anything. Then stopped syncing.Recommend you buy something better and worth the money.,1
3633,Good quality and nice and light.,5
3634,"Returning this product. I don't like it and seems to have stopped working.  I used and charged it two times and the third time it said it was charging for over 24 hours. The charging light never turned green and I can't get the band to sync anymore.  I don't know what happened to it, but even when it worked it was fairly inaccurate on my steps and my sleep cycle.  I ordered a new fitbit instead.  It's almost the same price and sooooo much better.",1
3635,Yeah pretty meh,2
3636,"This device doesn't offer anything special, meaningful, or accurate.  It's essentially just a waste of wrist-space.  The app doesn't provide much information, and the BMI analysis (etc) are very subjective and inaccurate.  Overall -- it really doesn't add any benefits that you couldn't get from a Fitbit or a smart watch with health tracking.  And the overall ""benefits"" are lacking.  I wore it and couldn't use a single bit of information from it.",1
3637,Deeply disappointed. Don't waste your money. Sleep tracking is somewhat helpful...when it works. No way I'll pose in underwear for body fat composition.,2
3638,After the 6th month free subscription ends I have been unable to sign up for the $3.99 monthly subscription I've spent over 2 hours on the phone with tech support and about an hour getting bounced back and forth between different Amazon websites there's an awful lot of information but there is no ability to sign up for the subscription.  In terms of an exercise tracker this band is great because my heart rate is pounding I've finally given up we will purchase a Fitbit and an oura ring.,1
3639,"I bought for the low profile, but unfortunately this item does not meets the quality standards of Amazon. Broke twice one me.1st time it broke it was replaced for free. Two months  later after receiving, the replacement it also died. Instead of receiving another replacement the rep just refunded my money instead of backing up the product!",1
3640,"Really liked the item until it gave out on me.  Now I am stuck with it and can't even get a refund.  Maybe I just got a defective one as I was one of the beta users, but still frustrating.",1
3641,Great,5
3642,I really like using the halo.,5
3643,Great product!  Super accurate and the app is very easy to use and read.,5
3644,"The sleep tracking seems to be okay. Activity tracking isn’t the best. Body scan is completely inaccurate. I was excited to be able to do the body scan and have results right then and there without paying for a body scan or going to the gym, but the results just are no where near accurate. The batter on this device continues to get worse. Overall would return if I could... definitely less features than I expected for Amazon and the features is does have aren’t great.",1
3645,I loved this product until the charger stopped working. Now I can't use it. I also can't get tech support on chat to help. I waited for over 2 hours for help. Still no help. I just need a replacement battery charger. Buyers beware.Update: Amazon sent me a replacement charger but did not work the problem is in the band. I got tired of trying to get this thing to work and tossed it out. It was really nice when it worked.,1
3646,Was able to see why I was so tired because my sleeping was so off,5
3647,Enjoying the Halo but probably will not continue after the free membership period.,5
3648,"I am so angry. I bought one for my husband and one for me. At the end of the trial period, they canceled the subscription for one of them. I wanted to renew, but apparently I have to purchase a second Amazon Prime account. One for my husband and one for me so we can both be subscribed. I am being pushe from one customer service rep to another.",1
3649,The sleep tracking worked once. Literally once. After hours and hours of calls to technical support - none of which were remotely helpful or even knowledgeable - I had to return it. At an Amazon Center 10 miles away.I can’t really say much about the other features. They worked just as well.It’s a pointless product. Especially when there are tens of products that might be slightly more costly but work much much MUCH better.,1
3650,"I wore this and an Apple Watch at the same time. In my first two workouts, it picked up great. But from the third workout on, the Apple Watch showed an intense workout with 170+ heart rate (standard workout for me), the Halo showed that I took a walk with HR off 110. I reset, powered down, uninstalled and reinstalled, factory reset... same thing. It just stopped working correctly. I returned it. I wanted badly for it to work... it simply didn’t.",1
3651,"I was really excited for this band and all the features it offered. But somewhere around 2 weeks after having it, (with no damage of any form), it stopped tracking my steps accurately, and my sleep cycle. Or it would simply not track it at all. It feels extremely overpriced for how cheap the actual device feels and functions. Not sure if I just received a defective one or what. Would definitely waste money/membership fees on unless they upgrade their hardware.",1
3652,I really like this,5
3653,"I never got most of the functionality to work. I literally attempted to set up Tone no less than 10 times! Prior to that I struggled to even pair the app, watch and phone. Halo also frequently disconnects from the Bluetooth. And the more functions I enable, the quicker my phone battery burns down? It shouldn't be this difficult! I'm afraid it's just not worth all of the hassle- especially when there are other fitness tracking options everywhere. I had high hopes but I'm returning the thing 2 days in!",1
3654,The sleep tracking is very helpful and the body image scan is an awesome tool.,5
3655,Loving this product thus far,5
3656,"Lasted just over a year, so it outlived the warranty but not my expectations. Got it in October of 2020, by January of 2022 it was a brick - won’t charge at all on any charger. Not a fan, won’t buy again.",1
3657,A lot of nice feature . Used it for fitness and sleep tracking.,5
3658,"If you don't mind having to log into the app to see your progress, then this band is ok.  I prefer to see my information on the face itself.  The band is pretty and didn't irritate my wrist like some so.",1
3659,Everyone should own one! It’s very lightweight and stay charged for days.,5
3660,Love the sleep tracking just wish it will track naps 😴,5
3661,Great metrics.  Works well.  Wish it integrated with apple health,5
3662,"I really enjoyed the tone part of the app, but the mic stopped working and it no longer tracks my tone.",2
3663,"I got one Halo and it would never track because it thinks it's (OFF WRIST) when i have it on, and snug at that. I returned the first one for another only to have the same issue. It works sometimes, but it's very rare. I've gone through steps to try and fix it with no luck. It would be a cool watch if it would actually track me.",1
3664,Erratic sleep information !,2
3665,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I liked the Halo initially!! I loved it for tracking sleep and steps! The pamphlet it came with said “it may be used for shallow water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean and can be worn in the shower.” I did none of these. I washed my face and did dishes with it on, at most. The sensor came off and the adhesive turned mushy. See photos. The return window has closed for my item and I’ve barely had it 6 weeks. CRAPPY!!",1
3666,The tracking is accurate but the band itself is very poorly made and not comfortable. I thought the app was too unorganized as well.,2
3667,"Device doesn’t even pair - set up is not easy- doesn’t play well with apple. Support for the product also sucks. Don’t waste your time, just get an Apple Watch. I would give it zero stars if I could.",1
3668,This was a great device I purchased but it only lasted less than 8 months and Customer Service will NOT replace as 30 days have passed.  I would say you mihjt consider staying with Garmin or Fitbit is Amazon cannot develop a better product or stand behind at least a one year warranty.  30 days is unacceptable for a warranty on this type of item.,1
3669,Improving my sleep!,5
3670,"Died after 9 months 😞Updates:I really want to love it, especially the customer service with replacement order is quite efficient and reliable, but I’m soooo tired with charging issues all this time after the replacement, it just can’t charge anymore, even I have a new adopter, I guess I have to get back to Apple Watch after all…",1
3671,The sleep tracking was great. It gave me the information to help my health,5
3672,"unnecessary, especially if you already have other trackers or an Apple Watch. Kinda weird that I am giving permission to Amazon to listen to my conversations, only to always be told that I sound unsure or confused. There is no display, so you have to open an app to see any details. They claim to be intertwined with WW, but WW has now added all the health features that Halo was using (sleep track, meditation, activity) so it’s now a completely unnecessary device that I no longer feel comfortable wearing.",1
3673,"I've had this for a few months.. bought it primary for sleep tacking and steps..wore it for a couple weeks but it was not comfortable for me to wear while sleeping so it went back in the box.. I pulled it back out just recently to give it another try but now it won't charge .. has been on a red light for days and will not turn on.. tried to clean off the charging port, different bricks and wall outlets as well.. very disappointed",1
3674,"Hurt wrist badly, especially at night when worn for sleep which is exactly why I bought it, for sleep tracking.The class/challenge type stuff they charge for I have zero interest in so even if it was free I wouldn’t use. I work out and go to the gym daily and don’t need a device or app to encourage me to do anything.Really had high hopes for this device and was pumped to test it in preview a few months back. Returned it within a few days, a completely failed experiment.",1
3675,This has become my new accountability partner in my walking and sleeping health.,5
3676,It was nice but with no screen had to always refer back to my phone for any information  which became a drawback.,2
3677,"Love the sleep tracker, good info, great app, holds a charge for good amount of time.",5
3678,So far it is great!,5
3679,Where the light is located after wearing constantly is irritating my wrist. I work nights and the sleep time and activity are askewed.,2
3680,"Out of all the bands I have tried, I find this the most accurate",5
3681,The device stop charging.,2
3682,"Band notch stretched out where the peg will not stay in within less than a week, just taking it off 4 times a day to wash dishes and bathe. What a disappointment. Want to love it. But I can not afford a new band for it every week.",1
3683,"Battery life is low. Other than the tone analysis, not sure what this does more than a smart watch.",2
3684,"Opened Christmas morning and went through the steps. It paired initially and (of course) needed an update. Said failed to update. Then never paired again. Spent time with support on the phone walking through steps to reset. The agent was helpful, informed, and polite but the device never turned back on.Update: Constantly has issues connecting to the app which is the only way to view data. Do not buy unless you're bored and enjoy being frustrated. Or if you find yourself in a Brewter's Millions situation.",1
3685,"Defective. Got the device, synced it to my phone and shortly thereafter it lost sync with my phone. Followed all troubleshooting steps and the device refused to factory reset to allow for reconnect. Very disappointed as the band was very comfortable to me and I liked the idea. The charger was also a very cool idea of a clamp to hold the device to the charge contacts.",1
3686,"This was too uncomfortable to wear (I've had two other brands of fitness bands/watches and multiple types within each of those brands and none are this uncomfortable).  I had many issues trying to sync it to my new, up to date phone. I'm not a tech genius, but I've never had a problem setting up technology before, so this experience was surprising and unpleasant. I will not be using it, and bought a different product from a different store instead.",1
3687,I haven’t been able to use the halo yet.  I changed my cell number a couple months ago.  Forgot to change it on Amazon.  I can’t set up the halo through the app without verifying my old number.  I’ve been on the phone with tech support.  I’ve changed my number on Amazon….  The app still comes up with my old number.,1
3688,I was disappointed that the Halo didn’t have a watch in/on it.I don’t want to have to wear 2 bands.,2
3689,Is my favorite tracker and I have different one from Fitbi and Garmin,5
3690,Battery dies quickly. Not as detailed as other heath trackers. I was actually hoping to return the item 😕,2
3691,Is very detailed with everything.,5
3692,"Stopped working completely after 7 weeks of use, warrenty accepted to return ot for 9$ restocking fees",1
3693,This item would be okay for 19.99. It doesn’t really track activities. It just tracks HBPM and it does it pretty badly. This is a crap item that’s only worth is the body image tech which is really just your phone.Downgrading to one star. It doesn’t even last the weekend when I did a full charge on Friday afternoon. This thing is poor crap.,1
3694,"This halo does not work, my first one had to be sent back because it was defective and couldn’t sink. The second one stopped charging within 2 weeks. It took over 6 weeks for me to get a refund and I had to hound Amazon which is so out of the ordinary for Amazon.  I was really excited for this product and was really dissatisfied with it. I don’t think it was ready for sale. I do not recommend buying it.",1
3695,Sent it back after wearing it for half a day.  The band was very irritating on my wrist,2
3696,Love it. Great sleep tracker is great and all the different labs they have are wonderful.,5
3697,Great product all around.,5
3698,I attached the unit to the wristband.  I was in a public place and was wearing a hoodie.  Pulled up my sleeves to wash my hands and the unit must have popped out from the wristband and lost on day 3.  I'm upset that the design didn't securely lock it in to the band.  I didn't realize until I got home and went to take it off for charging that the device was gone and it was just the band on my wrist.,1
3699,"I really like it, much better than Bella beat",5
3700,Had it for a couple weeks now and I like it amd the app.,5
3701,Waste of money very inaccurate,5
3702,"good quality and useful ,love it~",5
3703,"This worked as described for a few weeks. After getting used to it, it was actually pretty cool.Then it suddenly stopped taking a charge. I tried everything in the troubleshooting to get it to charge, but it won't. Now it's just an expensive velcro bracelet a.k.a. garbage",1
3704,It doesn’t work like it says it should. Pretty gimmicky and not worth time and money,1
3705,"I’m having trouble with this item I have not been able to access it, I am not sure why I brought it",1
3706,See above... this one wont even pair but seems to charge ok.  . so is essentially worthless. Customer service responded to first negative review with a new device. it is worse than the first.Wont be getting another.  Wasted money - I think this was a useless purchase,1
3707,"This ‘fitness tracker’ does not accurately track fitness at all. Some weeks I get 300 points and other weeks I’m at 120 with the same patterns. I was also excited about using the tone monitor, but that needs quite a bit of advancement in AI  to be useful. It also sucks a ton of battery - I’m having to charge twice a day. After only owning this a couple of months, the syncing rarely ever works. It’s basically garbage at this point.",1
3708,"And now I'm apparently out of my window to return it, so I'm stuck with this band that will not do anything. So that's lousy.But before that, I was okay with my Halo band. Not overwhelmed, but I wore it almost everyday. It did a great job tracking my sleep and I loved it as a heart rate monitor when I was exercising. But other than that, it was just okay. I wouldn't buy it again.",1
3709,Over estimates your steps massively. Body scanner sucks and does not accurately record body fat percentage.,2
3710,Comfortable and monitors everything from sleep patterns to steps! Absolute love it!!,5
3711,"This is not a well made product. A few months after using it the back feel off. I exchanged the product and fast forward and the back fell off if the replacement.  The mobile app has been updated the fearures are good. The sleep tracking is ok, but I  don't believe it is accurate. I never used the voice recognition feature.",1
3712,It works great,5
3713,My favorite is the sleep tracking and the body scan!,5
3714,"I have fibromyalgia, which causes unrefreshing sleep. However, it tells me ""GREAT"" on 7+ hours of sleep even when I feel like a truck ran over me. Does not differentiate between tossing and turning or actual insomnia.However purchased late October. It now won't pair with my app on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S21) and seems to not hold a charge and/or be dead.Feel like I was scammed. May just go back to my $24 pedometer.",1
3715,"The site say that you only need an ameriancan address to it can be ship and an American App Store account. That is not true, you need to have a American credit card.Support if you have the patience to lost at lest 40 min of your life, will not help you, because they really don't know anything.You can't export your data to your iPhone health app.Buy an Apple Watch, if you have an iPhone, other thing if you have an android app.",1
3716,I've worn my Amazon Halo just about daily for several months. Out of the blue it stopped charging. I've tried everything I can to wiggle it into the charging port and try to get it to charge. This product is meant for daily use and should last longer than a few months,1
3717,Very good! Like expected.,5
3718,After one year the band will not fully charge and takes hours to just get to 50%. Don't waste you money and time (charging) with this piece of junk. Called Amazon for a replacement and they offered me 15% of another one. Just awful!,1
3719,Wife loves the gift!,5
3720,"I liked everything, it's innovative and useful and extremely helpful!!",5
3721,"Within two month of owning this the one featuring I really enjoyed, the body scan stopped working.  I have read that it does not work with IOS new update.  I have reinstalled the software tried to update everything and still does not work.  I never use the voice recognition feature because it eats all my battery life.  The sleep feature is nice and I’ve ended up only wearing the halo at night.",1
3722,The battery runs down too quickly. You can’t tell the tome. Must use the app for everything. Disappointed.,2
3723,I love it. The sleep app allows you to track your sleep patterns.,5
3724,Awesome product!,5
3725,The idea is great. But accuracy problems forsure.  45 minites on the bike and live feed shows intense activity level for 15 minutes straight but after refreshing the app shows 2 minutes of intense activity for the entire day?!?!?!  And it doesnt seem to easily pick up if im working out at the gym. And a way to track food intake and water intake would be good. The bmi tracker is great but for an added fee after trial which i will cancel.,1
3726,What's the point to this if you need a phone and a membership just to use it? It's just a paperweight without them. The only thing I find useful is the sleep tracking. But you can only use it with a membership. Without a membership what's the point to this? I'm getting another fitness tracker without worthless memberships and that at least have a screen.,1
3727,"I bought this - twice. The first one broke about a month in - then the second died about a month in. Hubby is using his happily. The small black square with skin receptors (or what touches your wrist?) on the inside loosens, falls off. The only difference is I wear moisturizer. Two deaths in two months? Sadly - it is not for me.",1
3728,"easy on and off, no distractions from text messages or phone calls...",5
3729,It's not tracking my sleep and such... This was the second Halo. The battery worked better... But I find it too sensitive to the point if I don't move precisely  it will not pick up the steps or movement.,1
3730,"Failing to sync has been a sporadic problem from the beginning.  It would sync without a problem for several days and then inexplicably quit syncing for a day or two, only to start syncing again.  This time is has been 4 days since I have been able to sync.  I really liked the sleep tracking feature, but at this point it feels like I wasted my money on an unreliable device.",1
3731,"Amazon, sorry but this is NOT worth $100 - the charge does not last as long as indicated! I'll stick w/ my Fitbit because I do not need to subscribe to an app to use it. I noticed the new Halo have the time which I would have liked for the price. :-(",1
3732,Device is small and unobtrusive. App is great - love the features like body vision.,5
3733,"The hardware is horrible. I had to return the first one shortly after I received it because it just flat out stopped working. The replacement lasted 6 months, but didn't capture my workouts accurately. The final insult is when the sleep tracking stopped working, at which point it just became useless. I can't even return it, I guess they only replace it once in the first year.",1
3734,The battery last 2 days max so you have to charge it either at night and loose a night of sleep tracking or charge it during the day and loose that activity from being recorded.  It’s a HUGE pain to remember to charge it so often. Not worth it,1
3735,It was a gift and she loved it too!,5
3736,Today I put it aside in the useless object I unfortunately bought. There no real added value to this. Everything is not well done. It’s like an unfinished product with no real function. I used for 6 months and that was it. After a month my opinion was done but I gave it a chance. Useless. There is so many other products on the market that worth it. This is not part of it. Avoid,1
3737,The battery doesn't last 7 days. Have to charge everyday even without tone on. After 3 wks. Device quit working all together. A complete waste.of money and time. And support is no help. Changed battery all that did everything support said and still doesn't work. Amazon got me for 100$. DO NOT PURCHASE,1
3738,"The thing worked great, to be honest. However, I bought a rubber sport strap for it and was out running around with my kids today at a large park and apparently the actual device detached from the band and is now lost. It was obviously really comfortable because I didn’t even notice until about 30 minutes after we left. Oh well. If you purchase it make sure it’s super secure before doing anything.",1
3739,"Battery life barely manages 1.5 days,  has difficulty syncing, I have a protection plan on this item, how do I get item fixed, replaced, or returned!  Miss the clock that my old fitbit had....on the plus side, the HALO is nice looking, it just does not stay charged long enough....would just as soon return this item and the Sport accessory band that I have not even removed from the box....",1
3740,"I got this b/c I was excited for sleep tracking, fitness tracking and voice assessment.The voice thing is cool. It really helped me to correct the way I talked.The sleep tracking is terrible. It doesn't work if you sleep on it.  It didn't really catch when I fell asleep or when I woke up. It would say I was awake for an hour here and there every night.Pink band got discussing after a week.Super disappointed.",1
3741,I enjoy wearing it. It is easy to read and charge.,5
3742,"This “watch” burned my wrist. I have worn it every day and night since I received it nearly three weeks ago. I kept it on in the shower, while sleeping, doing dishes, and everything else I do daily. IT BURNED MY WRIST!!! I can’t believe it. It’s dangerous to wear this watch and I would not recommend it for anybody. I wear my Apple Watch daily, and it does almost everything this watch does, except it’s comfortable and doesn’t burn my skin.",1
3743,Now I understand my sleep type.But not that good battery time.,5
3744,The charger is complete and total junk. The absolute worst designed charger I have ever had the displeasure of using in my entire life. It takes 5 to 10 minutes of jiggling and smashing to get the unit to charge and you will do this dance EVERY SINGLE TIME you need to charge the device.,1
3745,It is minimalistic and analyzes tone and my body fat. Happy so far!!,5
3746,No sirve para absolutamente nada que no pueda hacerse con un smartwatch normal. No funciona con alexa. La batería es una porquería. La aplicación aún en desarrollo no sirve para absolutamente nada y oye que también te cobramos usar nuestra aplicación :)  enojado es quedarse corto. Me siento súper estafado.,1
3747,,5
3748,Purchased the Halo - liked it for a few months and felt like the data was better than my apple watch fitness app.  After 6 months it stopped synching with my phone.  I would NOT recommend especially if you like your apple watch - I was wearing the halo on one wrist and my apple watch on another - it was ALOT.,1
3749,"This is in no way ready for wide release...On the first one: it barely worked for a couple weeks, and did not track sleep or HR with accuracy. It was also unable to save the body scan info fot tracking. I was advised it was a hardware issue and they sent a replacement.On the second one: never worked. It was non functioning right out of the box.I'm still waiting for a refund after almost 3 weeks!",1
3750,"It was useful for sleep tracking. Everything else was easily accomplished by devices I already had. But it just died after I reset it to link with a new phone to see the sleeping tracking and isn’t restarting, with no replacement option, so I’m calling it a bust. Don’t waste your money. Go with a tried-and-true.",1
3751,👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,5
3752,The timer accuracy and sensory in sleep mode is amazing.Good product,5
3753,Initially it was great. Then it just stopped wanting to charge soon after. We have another Halo that charges fine so I know it’s not the charger. Tried contacting support - no help. I kinda tossed it in a drawer and forgot about it. Now I’m getting billed monthly which reminded me I had it and now canceling.,1
3754,"There are no real filter can't get rid of beans, legumes, cheese, shrimp, etc. Extremely desapointed",1
3755,Product worked fine as a fitness/sleep tracker but randomly stopped working and the hard reset did not work. Returning.,2
3756,I love this item it helps me keep track of my sleeping habits.,5
3757,"The 3D photo feature put a dent in my self esteem.  I’m not overweight but Honestly, if you think or you struggle with self esteem or eating disorder, do your self a favor and don’t buy it. I feel much happier when I returned it.",1
3758,"Innovative product, new on the market & already far superior to fitbit",5
3759,"Very useful! I love how it tracks my sleep, and my body measurements.",5
3760,Could not read heart rate. Customer service couldn't fix the problem. Had to return.,1
3761,its a cool way to monitor activity and conversation,5
3762,It's noice!,5
3763,"Sad it didn’t work for me during intro phase of rollout. Hopefully they worked out the issues because the metrics and app were great, when the app worked. Issue was device would lose connection to app and had trouble reconnecting. After 45min trying to get it to reconnect using the troubleshooting steps, gave up and returned the device. The body fat percent and visual interface were the draw for me. Also the sleekness of the design even in my small wrist.",1
3764,I really liked this product but it is not durable or just poorly made. I was carful never got it wet I don’t even exercise vigorously and out of know where it fell apart I got it June 25 and on 8/31/2021 it broke. The concept is really cool it’s just poorly made.,1
3765,"I loved the idea of a faceless band, but this doesn't connect to any other apps I use. It doesn't connect with Noom, it doesn't connect with The Mirror, and it doesn't even connect with Apple Health. I ended up ordering a fitbit. I would have liked it if I didn't want it to connect with anything else, but let's face it, we need our apps to talk to each other or it's useless.",1
3766,I think this is a great concept but spent most of my time trying to reconnect it and majority of time it would not connect.  If you can keep it connected it will do what you want.  Did every troubleshooting trick. No luck.,1
3767,Amazon halo team - could you have the app available on the India store also.I recently bought this halo device from the USA amazon store to my home country India to later find out that I cannot download the app for this device on the India iOS store.,1
3768,Never got connected,1
3769,"I love this product, better than Fitbit. The lab programs are the best.",5
3770,Man. I upset about how good this can be. At week 5. Went the whole week without syncing. Battery only lasts 12 hrs. Body scan worked only once. My fiancé stopped wearing hers after the second week. At this point we just have meet soft wear issues and in this day and age. I can’t speak to or chat with an Amazon rep. Y’all can do better. Money lost but still love the brand.,1
3771,"Great except it fell apart after 3 months. I didn't get it wet, but went to put it on and the back came off.Called for replacement and customer service stated that this doesn't normally happen. Obviously it does. I was sent a Refurbished replacement.  Item hasn't been out for 6 months, I had it for 3 months and it breaks. The opportunity to rebuild confidence lost. Never again!",1
3772,Data was worthless and inaccurate.,2
3773,The device completely stopped working. It won't sync and it also stopped charging. Followed ALL of the troubleshooting options and nothing resolved the issue. Tried to start a return on the item and it was blocked because it is outside of the return window. Would have been nice if the product had worked for longer than 6 weeks.,1
3774,I’ve own multiple wearables. This is by far my least favorite. The sleep tracking isn’t very accurate. The data is limited. The battery needs to be charged every day and there’s a monthly fee. Not a fan of this purchase,1
3775,"Ordered September 21, 2020. Device quit charging May 9, 2020. Useless now. I expect a device that costs this much to at least last a couple years. This one didn’t even make it one year. Now I have to figure out how to cancel the monthly subscription they auto enrolled me in. Stick to the name brand device that’s been around for years.",1
3776,"The body indexing feature would not work on a 1.5 year old smart phone. Amazon support could not solve the problem.The included band is small, will not come apart like a normal band: it broke within two days while pulling it over my hand.The device stopped charging within three months. Amazon support was unable to help.Amazon is great for making purchases, but it seems to suck at product development and support.",1
3777,ExcellentEasy to use light and accurateBattery lasts no complaints,5
3778,"Really great for working out, and overall daily health !",5
3779,The product is great! I love the sleep actvity.,5
3780,I've had a fitbit for years and bought this as a backup and to calculate body fat percentage. I've been wearing both the fitbit and halo and the halo doesn't register the same amount of steps. The body fat calculator does a photo of you to calculate the percentage. I had my body fat calculated at the gym and it was 29%. Halo calculated it at 41%. I should have returned it. I will stick with fitbit for now,1
3781,We really like the fit of the band and sleep tracking.,5
3782,"I waited a really long time to get this product, specially when they were offering the Early Bird option. I waited and never got a confirmation e-mail. Now this product is finally available and I received it, after a few days of use it stopped working. I contacted support trying to fix it, no success. Honestly, this is a waste of money and time. I'm sorry for the ones who bought this hoping to improve their health lifestyle.",1
3783,Love all the different features available including different exercise routines.,5
3784,"I’ve had this product since it initially released.This product band broke out my wrist after wearing for about 3 months, rash on the inside, outside and side of wrists. Will not purchase and I want to send the product back",1
3785,Great tracker,5
3786,"What’s the point of the product if it doesn’t stay paired and synced. It worked the first day and then I had trouble getting it back to syncing yo with the app on my phone. To make it worse, support is not responsive. I don’t see how this product retains its customers.",1
3787,It’s suppose to be able to monitor heart rate.  It’s laughably inaccurate...🙄,2
3788,I had great expectations for this device. After a few months it died. First I was not able to recharge  the battery and then it went completely off. A waste of money. Bad product.,1
3789,Way more comfortable to use as a sleep tracker than my smart watch.,5
3790,Love the halo. Has improved my workouts greatly,5
3791,I find that this isn’t accurate whatsoever. The apps are nice. The sleep tracking and mood tracker are elementary.,2
3792,The only thing I miss is watch face,5
3793,This product does everything it claims to.,5
3794,Could not get the voice recognition to work and sleep sometimes does not track accurately.,2
3795,"I've never had a Fitbit or anything like this, but whenever i put it on, I feel a zing or a charge up my arm. Which gives me a headache and a weird feeling at my heart. I have recently had panic attacks and now Central apnea. I'm never had any of this before until this watch. Maybe it's just me or a weird coincidence.",1
3796,For the price I guess it's exactly what you should expect. it looks feels and functions like a low price late to the game attempt at a tracker. Its much larger then expected for the lack of functions compared to the other trackers out there. It is kind of painful to have on and the band is very uncomfortable. Its the perfect gift for the person that returns everything you buy them or just same the delivery person the headache.,1
3797,I like that it is slim and comfortable.,5
3798,I did not like it. Closed it out.,2
3799,"Love it, the sleep monitor is a lil off though",5
3800,Battery was terrible and didn't offer anything much more then garmin.... Decided to go fill garmin ecosystem now.,2
3801,Not worth it. The band was allergic. Returned it and Amazon never returned my money.,2
3802,"You should be able to go into settings and choose your measurement preference, miles, steps, kilometers or steps",2
3803,"It does what it's supposed to, and it's not too intrusive.",5
3804,"Reminds me of the UP24 fitness trackers; not only are these things pretty much worthless, but it actually put sores on my wrist.  No doubt due to rubbing so I had a choice, wear it loose and have it worthless or take it off completely.  I opted to take it off.  Really disappointed in you Amazon; not only is Halo worthless, but your Fire TV Cubes are less than worthless.",1
3805,Unfortunately my husband got this for Christmas and only had the chance to wear it for about 2 weeks before it stopped working very disappointed in this product we love Amazon and everything that Amazon has had to offer until now no support no help and of course we got the run around when I tried to return it.,1
3806,3-4 day battery life is a good feature.,5
3807,Links directly to my Weight Watchers app,5
3808,The product started not to work and tried to get tech support.  Non existent.  It is amazing that customer service people do not even know the existence of this product.  They told me to talk to the manufacturer!  Like Hello?????  Don't waste your money on this product.,1
3809,Just could not like it really wanted to but could not do it,2
3810,"It does not seem like a well thought out product. In weight, the lowest is 50lbs, but the lowest you can input is 80lbs. Why have the option for a lower number if you aren't going to let a person select it? And if you can't input a weight, you can't use the body scan accurately. The sleep tracker isn't very good either, it doesn't track naps very well.",1
3811,Long battery life  The app is easy to use,5
3812,Pointless little thing.  I’m mailing it back.  I got a Fitbit Charge 3 instead.,2
3813,Very comfortable to wear.  Battery life is only 1-2 days.  No warning battery is dying.,2
3814,Less than a year old and the charger no longer works! Amazon says it’s out of support window and it’s not even a year old. Does Amazon support its products and customers? Amazon please do the right thing and send a charger that works- please!,1
3815,I like the sleep tracking and the step counter,5
3816,The band does not do a great job tracking anything but cardio and even that is off sometimes. It frequently does not track activities or will say I was active when I wasn’t. Also it will occasionally not track sleep either. If I were you I’d go with another product,1
3817,"It dies so fast, by the time I try to look at the information I cannot sync it because the tracker is dead. It dies within a couple hours even after a full charge. I was really looking forward to this, but after being disappointed it sat for months before I decided to give it a try again yesterday. Still a waste of money and time for me. I expect better.",1
3818,Best sleep tracking on the market,5
3819,"This is  a regrettable purchase. Don't buy it.It doesn't record sleep anywhere near accurately. On nights I have tossed and turned and woken up several times, My score was high? I apparently slept well. Nope.I'd also love to know how I went walking in my sleep when I didn't leave my bed.",1
3820,"Like the app & how it tracks - but absolutely hate how it feels on my wrist. Bulky, convex (instead of resting on the natural of the wrist) shape that I am pretty sure it's the reason why now the base of my thumb is hurting. I want to love it- but it really hurts- and I am not into codependent relationships. Wish I could return.",1
3821,"Inaccurate on all fronts. Tone tracking only listens sporadically, and still drains the battery in 24 hours. Body scans were a full 40% off when compared to inBody. Sleep tracking has trouble knowing when sleep starts and ends, and given the problems everywhere else I don’t trust any of the details it provides in this area (REM/ light sleep/ deep sleep/ body temp).",1
3822,"I ordered the Halo fitness band from Amazon a little over 6 months ago. When it worked, it was nice. However, the battery can't hold a charge anymore, and when I looked to see if I could get a replacement, they only have a 6-month support window instead of 1 year, so it looks like I'm out of luck. They need better built-in batteries.",1
3823,My husband loves his new watch,5
3824,"It was a great device for the two weeks it worked.  Now it randomly synching, but no data transfer.  I've tried reconnecting and factory resetting but nothing has worked.  Might as well have flushed my money down a toilet.",1
3825,"Terrible connectivity. Just terrible. I've been trying to connect for more than an hour, nothing works. It keeps searching for the band. It connects and lose connectivity. So don't recommend ;)I've been using a Samsung band for years, and never ever had any problem with connecting it.Sad that the amazon band did not work.",1
3826,Sleep tracking was more than I expected,5
3827,"Apparently I always sound scared and angry... or it doesn’t like my voice... not sure which. If you wear this for a month, your wrist will become sensitive and sore, and I got a rash (yes, I practice good hygiene, lol)The charger is absolutely the worst... after the second use, I had to fiddle with it for 10 to 15 minutes every time I charged it...",1
3828,Bought it 6/18/21 - have been using it religiously - since i started my weight loss journey - then today 7/24/21 - it lost connection and I had to re-pair to my phone. All previous data is lost. Amazon instructions stated data would remain but they lied. Calling amazon for a refund.,1
3829,"I have Apple Watch and it’s far superior. I realize the watch is intended for more, but the band just didn’t have anything that I connected with.I did like on the app that you could do a scan of what you look like and what you’ll look like at different weights/body fat %.",1
3830,Battery died in 6 months.,2
3831,Terrible. Never worked right and couldn't get help replacing it now it's too late and I'm very upset. My Son and his wife bought some too and they are not too happy either.,1
3832,The device is nice and app is good when it works.  Unfortunately I've had two of the Bands already fail and stopped charging after only a few weeks time.,1
3833,Stopped charging. I liked it quite a bit…until it died.,1
3834,I really like the sleep feature on this device!,5
3835,Worked good while it did. Now it will not hold a charge. I’ve only had it maybe 3 months and it’s dead within less than 24 hours. It also doesn’t seem to correctly calculate my sleep tracking. I do like the app and how it tracks body fat and worked with ww but not worth it if the battery is just going to die on you.,1
3836,Very informative. Keeps me active,5
3837,"While the concept is great, the execution fails spectacularly. Most of the time it refuses to sync. The sleep tracking is significantly inaccurate and there is no way to manually input the correct sleep times. The mobile app has a great design and helpful features, but is useless if the band doesn't function as advertised.",1
3838,"Disappointed but perhaps it will improve over time. Sleep tracking works only at times, not consistent.",2
3839,I love it it’s amazing! I especially love the tone analyzer!,5
3840,I have worn fitbits for years and wanted something different so when I saw a Prime Day Deal on this I jumped on it.It doesn’t display the time.It needs charging everyday.You need to look at the app to see your stats.I question it’s accuracy.I’m very disappointed.DO NOT BUY!,1
3841,I like nothing about this product,1
3842,The minimum age is 13 yet there is no place on this page that tells you this fact. I found out when I tried to set up my band for my child who is having sleep problems. We could probably lie with an age but we would not get the full effect of the band.,1
3843,"This has been a very frustrating few weeks trying endlessly to like this. But after my first one had issues with the battery dying quickly, its replacement managed to last 2 days before needing to be charged only for me to be unable to sync the watch to the app. It won’t even power on. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong but I think this just isn’t for me.",1
3844,Sleep tracking doesn't work if you sleep with your wrist under your pillow?  DumbHeart rate is ok but where's the BP and oxygen.  Knew I should have purchased the fit bit.  Waste of $100 and now you won't refund????  In transit......STILL?????,1
3845,Not worth the Hype or the money....wasted my money...,2
3846,Like the sleep tracking a lot.,5
3847,Gives you no incentive to improve. Just seams to give you negative feedback. Does not provide activity reminder. Does not recognize improvement. We all do not start out great.Data is hard to access in app.Only good this to say about it is Battery life is good. But have not tried the vocal features which would kill this.,1
3848,"Great concept but like all Amazon products it’s lack luster.  I bought one at the Amazon store.  It’s charger is horrid and doesn’t work most of the time.  Are a few months it will say connected, but not charge and not connect all features.  Not worth the price for what you get.",1
3849,"I tried many different solutions recommended and could not get it to work.  I went through the same thing with your customer service and they could not figure it out as well.  This is very disappointing.  I was really looking forward to using it.  So, I returned it.",1
3850,"I enjoyed the Halo for eye balling my steps and sleep everyday. I honestly didn't use any other features. I didn't mind having to charge it every third day. I like the winter color too. I've had the Halo just a few days before Christmas. Now it has completely stopped working and I can no longer return it. I am truly disappointed, Amazon.",1
3851,Worked for one day.,1
3852,"I was really excited to receive my Halo & my husband even got one of his own.  We wanted to track sleep patterns and kinda check each other with tones in our voices.  it's nearly impossible to place in the right spot and when you DO find that spot, it's extremely uncomfortable and way too tight.  I wish I could return it.",1
3853,"works as advertised, light and comfortable",5
3854,For the first couple of weeks it worked fine but after that I had taken it off for a day and after that I had problems. Tried to reprogram it but had to call the company for help started working and with in a few days it stopped again needless to say it was too late to send it back GO FIGURE,1
3855,Awful!😡 This is my 2nd band. I'm so disappointed. In order to reset and trouble shoot this device you must carry the charger with you at all times. They don't tell you this. Sleep tracking is horrible. Customer service is horrible. Jeff I'm a very unsatisfied customer. Do better.. with this device it has so much potential just horrible. Go back to the drawing board.,1
3856,"Excellent product, lightweight and very accurate",5
3857,Love it. I wear it all the time,5
3858,Love it! Comfortable and has so many awesome features.,5
3859,The scan feature is very accurate,5
3860,Used this for 2 months. Noticed my wrist starting hurting. I had a 3rd degree burn when I woke up one morning. Happened to my wife as well. This is very concerning. Threw it into the trash.,1
3861,"Very disappointed in this device. While I loved the app and the zone tracking, the device itself was not well thought out. I found the charger difficult to connect to the device as the band has to be in just the right position to connect with port. Also at some point my band simply stopped syncing; meaning that it no longer tracked any data. At that point it’s useless. Going back to Fitbit",1
3862,"I have never been able to sync the band to the app, even with multiple attempts to get help.  Now, I have been charging the band for over 12 hours and it still isn't charged.  Skip this one and try another device.",1
3863,Worked great for one day. Loved the sleep tracker. Inexplicably disconnected itself and would not pair back up. No amount of resetting would work. Would connect for a minute and then disconnect.  Got a message that I needed to repull. Re pull exactly what? No real tech support docs. Bluetooth on phone was fine. What a turd. I didn't get it wet or drop it or anything. Battery was still charged.,1
3864,The band shuts down and is a total pain.,2
3865,Charger broken out of the box. Received replacement charger 2 weeks later. New charger doesn't work either or the Halo itself isn't functioning properly. Won't charge or turn on. Called support and gave me a refund with no replacement option unless I buy it again at full price instead of the discounted price I bought this at originally. Don't buy this if you want something built to last and be used frequently.,1
3866,Was not impressed with the Halo band.  Battery life was basically nonexistent.  Had to charge at least twice a week and I didn’t even have the voice features on.  Spend a little extra and get a Fitbit.,1
3867,"I don’t understand how can Amazon make such a scrap product. This is nothing but cheap Chinese device, nothing works properly with this device, app for this is bigger scrap then device. We get far better products then this here in Amazon itself for less then half of its price. They are only spoiling their brand image with such cheap scrap.",1
3868,"I was so excited to get this when it came out. Then there were lots of issues and glitches. Kept waiting for resolution, none came. Eventually just stopped wearing, it was a waste",1
3869,Very useful minimalist tracker. Love it.,5
3870,I love it,5
3871,That it doesn't stay charged long!,5
3872,Most Accurate Fitness band I own!,5
3873,Battery life is terrible. I have to charge it every morning. The concept and the band are great but I would not recommend this product. The body composition is way off as well. It said I was at 42% body fat but when I tested it on a medical (recently) calibrated it was only 25.5%.,1
3874,I couldn't get it to pair with my i-Phone. believe me I tried.,2
3875,Bought for my daughter she loves it,5
3876,Programs and workouts offered are great!,5
3877,Great for monitoring sleep paterns,5
3878,"I was loving my band and this would have been 5 star until one of the pins got bent in the charger clip and it no longer charges. A new charger is $20, kind of expensive for a $99 band and not really worth paying 20% of the cost of the band.",1
3879,It is very comfortable. I did truly enjoy the sleep tracking function. The body composition scanner is cool when it works.  The body composition feature is weird and malfuntions. The tone feature does not work. I ordered a replacement which was then cancelled by amazon so i guess they just don't want people to have this item? My halo was returned. Sad because this product definitely has potential.,1
3880,"I'm getting 24-48 hours of battery life max. That's with the features, like Tone, that Amazon identifies as battery killers turned off. This item is a waste of money!I was hoping for an upgrade from my Fitbit Versa. The Halo is a substantial downgrade with fewer features in addition to lousy battery life",1
3881,"Halo will no longer charge, not sure if it’s the charger or the halo but both seem to be cheaply made. The mobile app sucks too, crashes constantly and doesn’t offer many useful metrics. Voice recognition mode is a gimmick at best. Sleep tracking is useful but poor battery life means daily charging which is probably why it will no longer charge after 6 months.",1
3882,"My band connect to Bluetooth but the app isn’t able to locate the band. I have factory reset it intern times, multiple attempts to tried to get app to locate band, keep getting error message. So the band is useless. It was gift and now too late to return. Very disappointed.",1
3883,Got this device and right off the bat it asked me strip my clothes and scan my body. And then on it says it wants to listen to me and start giving me feedback and not sure how I can take that feed back and improve myself. And the major turn off is it doesn't show a heart rate graph which I can see in any device out there. DO NOT BUY,1
3884,I used this on my right wrist while wearing an apple watch on the left. Sleep tracking is way off. Fitness tracking is hard to compare but likely ok. Not as much useful  data as I would like. The other features seem worthless. Trying to pair with a new phone but it appears to be impossible to transfer the halo app to the new phone. Get a fitbit!,1
3885,"I've loved Amazon tech in the past, and wanted to love this. Unfortunately, I don't. The device is uncomfortable, the tone and body scan features invasive bordering on creepy, and the rest of the data and ""coaching"" marginal. This product needs more than an upgrade... it needs to go back to he drawing board. Mine is now in the drawer of dead tech...",1
3886,"Does not provide useful information, terrible battery life, poor charger design. Overall frustrating experience.",2
3887,"Was looking forward to switching from fitbit. Phone recognizes it but device wont show up on the app. Real shame. Customer service was zero help, basically just copy and pasted the instructions in an email. What a joke",1
3888,A good premise but not quite what i was looking for.,2
3889,I’m not seriously impressed with the Halo. The battery runs out crazy fast for something that isn’t a watch. I don’t think it should be priced higher that the early access of $69. It’s definitely NOT worth more than that. I get extremely frustrated with how it doesn’t sync properly on a regular basis.  SUCKY support. I strongly advice you to not buy this product.,1
3890,"Terrible fitness tracker.  Today I did a cycling workout, well into my “intense” HR range, and it recorded NOTHING. It shows the HR spike in the tracker but nothing was credited for activity points. But it did give me activity points for folding my laundry. So if you aren’t moving your arms, good luck. Really wish I hadn’t tossed the packaging I would return.Also caused significant skin irritation.",1
3891,Very confusing and some days track and some other days don't.,2
3892,I was so excited to try this. BUT...! unfortunately the Halo won't work for my. I've got an allergic reaction to the device. My skin started itching where the metal was touching it. It resulted in a rash on my skin. My skin itches every time I try to wear it. For that reason I have to give it one star. I have to return it and get a refund.,1
3893,Not dependable. Stops working,1
3894,Like this product alot,5
3895,I like everything about it.,5
3896,"I really wanted to like this, but I also want to detach from my phone. I used this for one week before going back to my Fitbit. I like to see the screen, my steps, log activities, tell the damn time. The concept and the design were great, but I want to know the time without needing to have my phone on me 24/7. Pass.",1
3897,Short battery life. Not really providing information I want. Sleep part is great,2
3898,"Honestly overall, it was alright. But however I ended up with a burn spot in my arm from the band. I got super sick. A few hours after I took it off I was fine.. never again.",1
3899,"I ordered my halo 12/31/20, it literally came January 2021 and it’s broken. Wont turn on or charge... I’ve tried everything. I’m so upset because I actually liked this product but seriously? Not even 4 months later and it’s broken?! There should be a replacement or something but I can’t even return!? Super messed up Amazon.",1
3900,Sleep calculation is way off.  Uncomfortable to wear.  I am returning it.,2
3901,Days of not showing how many steps I took accurately... Ex: mowing the lawn for 2 hours tracker showed only 800 steps. After 1 month completely stopped working at all after a few days of charge.,1
3902,There are constant connection problems.  It doesn’t track sleep well at all. I feel it is just making up numbers - no connection to reality.  Seems like a little piece of junk.,1
3903,Helps me to stay active!,5
3904,"Had it for five months. I never get it wet, treat it carefully. The glass fell out, the plastic part that was keeping it in is all gooey. No idea what happened- it literally just sits on my wrist. I only take it off to shower and charge. Poorly made, I guess?!",1
3905,"I really wanted to like this! I enjoyed all the features and data this band provided,  but after just 2 days of normal wear, I was left with electrical burns. I did not wear this product in water or have any kind of unusual activity I can think of that might cause this.  You can see actual char marks on the device!",1
3906,Halo is an overall disappointment.I was intrigued with the voice analyzing feature...fail.The sleep tracker  is wildly inaccurate....fail.The activity tracker is based on a point system that is almost impossible to achieve...fail.The only thing I actually find helpful is some of the labs. I do use Headspace and Relax Melodies.The battery life.....fail.The sedentary reminder...never received a reminder.,1
3907,Love this!,5
3908,: Is too hard to use. It needs more direction.,2
3909,Seems to work well enough,5
3910,fit bid  phones  do a much better job and provide more,2
3911,"From day 1 this halo band did not track data correctly,  sleep, exercise..really anything.  Now after 3 months it is collecting no data at all, despite all the troubleshooting.",1
3912,This thing is bulky & hurts. I have an Apple Watch and bought this to track sleep at night while my watch is charging. I lasted two nights. My wrist is sore and I’m not sure I trust the readings. I actually have no idea where this tracker is anymore. It’s probably hiding from the trash because that’s where it belongs.,1
3913,Broke after having it a little over a month,2
3914,"While generally I liked the activity and sleep tracker, the band completely stopped charging and working two weeks after the product support window closed.  Given the number of competitive products out there, this one feels like a big fail.  What a waste of money.",1
3915,"Everything works as you expect it to. But who cares? I know how my last conversation went, how my sleep was and if I've been active enough. I see no value in this. Maybe if they MASSIVELY increased the voice ability to recognize others or record info/transcribe conversations.",1
3916,Information needed is a bit invasive.It doesn't seperate individual activities,2
3917,"I can't believe this thing stopped working 7 months after I bought it.Also, don't use voice recognition unless you want to be gaslit by your halo. You'll question your own feelings.",1
3918,Doesn't work,1
3919,"Purchased in May, and by November it stopped synching altogether. The app doesn’t really help with this scenario… it keeps asking me to double click the button and doing so does absolutely nothing. Useless.",1
3920,"The Halo worked great for the week I had it. I went for a run one evening, only to return with an empty band. The Halo device itself had somehow become dislodged and fell off. Obviously with no GPS equipped it has remain lost. Great idea but the design is flawed. I cannot imagine I’m the only one that had this happened.",1
3921,I have been waiting almost two weeks for a return email from customer service.  My band will not sync to my new phone because of a phone number change. Customer service is not returning emails.,1
3922,"This band isn’t worth it if you want it for HR monitoring during activity.  At first, I thought it was a one off that the device was showing 65bpm during intense training. After a handful of more intense sessions, I’m certain it’s a consistent default.  Wish I had not missed the return window.  I’d definitely get my money back.",1
3923,The voice analysis is interesting,5
3924,Great product,5
3925,"One of the reasons I wanted to try the Halo was that it tracked workouts automatically based on heart rate etc. This never happened. It was a huge pain to sync, then I had to factory reset after I noticed it wasn't tracking workouts(per support).",1
3926,Does not sync with Apple Health. That's a deal breaker for me. Otherwise has a lot of good features and priced better than comparable bands. Bummer.,1
3927,DId anyone bother to wear this band before putting it on the market. The shape of the head is a long rectangle that constantly bumps against the wrist bone making it impossible to wear overnight or for long stretches.The sleep tracker is not very accurate and the system of tracking activity is bogus. What happened to counting steps?Poor investment,1
3928,"The mobile app is terrible. It worked well the first few months, but lately the app crashes or takes forever to sync. Sleep tracking is way off; even if it was, half the time I can’t analyze the data because the app crashes or doesn’t sync properly. Useless without the app, and the app is terrible.",1
3929,easy yo use,5
3930,Very cool device,5
3931,Love it needa more band accessories,5
3932,I love my Halo!!,5
3933,"It was great until it stopped working. After 4 months, it started lagging (on the app) and finally the app failed to open. I tried everything under the sun to make it start again but finally rendered it useless. My husband gave me his and it’s fine now. I noticed that Amazon is no longer selling the Halo.",1
3934,"While I liked the idea of this, the strap is so uncomfortable, I haven't been able to use it for more than one day. I also did not like the fact that I still needed to wear an actual watch along with this, since the Halo does not even have the time visible, and its bulky which makes it look ridiculous to wear both.",1
3935,Very comfortable and easy to use,5
3936,This band disconnects constantly and does not track the information when it does. Not worth the money because you don’t get the data this way. When you call Amazon for help no one seems to know what this device is and you spend a ton of time on hold. I hope I can return for my money back!,1
3937,"Great concept and ecosystem, but the band and app are a POS. Band disconnects often, and won't connect to app again until you deregister and go through an entire setup again!... FRUSTRATING & DISAPPOINTING, really bad piece of hardware/connectivity.",1
3938,Loving this band so far!,5
3939,It works as advertised,5
3940,Useless purchase. One of my worst products. Could not work on android and once the free subscription expired it can’t work outside of the US to purchase monthly subscription. Definitely a 0.,1
3941,Broke after 3 months. Will not charge. Worked pretty well as a fitness and sleep tracker. The tone of voice feature keeps telling me to get psychiatric help. The rest of the functions are a bit confusing. It also disconnects from my phone a lot and had to be deleted from my device and reinstalled.,1
3942,"I loved the app and the motivation it gave to reach so many points a week but the band started to look dingy and the rest of the attributes didn’t really add up to how great my other “tracker” is. Plus, it’s a little bulky. I was hoping it would give metrics like a Woop might.",1
3943,"Tracking doesn't work. Best Amazon could do us ""have you charged it or turned it off and back on?"" Lesson learned, won't be giving Amazon a shot with any future products like this.",1
3944,The point system is demotivating and the accuracy of steps counted and body fat measurement are both very questionable.  I now know that the supporting studies are internal which makes things even more questionable.  The app itself isn't laid out well either.,1
3945,I loved it when it worked. Ive had it since January but have only been able to charge it twice.  I did all the troubleshooting in the video and still no luck. I guess its too late to get a return so it was just a waste of money. Very disappoining !,1
3946,High expectations followed by the reality of a VERY limited activity band.  Biggest disappointment was with tone assessment - words/phrases that drove the tone assignment are not indicated.  Steps not counted when Halo is off wrist.  Having to pay a subscription for a highly constrained functionality is throwing $ out the window.  Avoid the Halo! - not worth it!,1
3947,Best yet,5
3948,I was geeked to get this device after using a Fitbit for years.  I found the wristband uncomfortable and frankly I guess I like seeing my results at a glance.  I hope Amazon will continue its efforts to find a device to compete with Fitbit but I feel the Halo is not a worthy competitor.,1
3949,"Most the everything is OK with this except that it gave a perfectly shaped electrical burn on my arm. Shaped like the sensor. When I got the device it made me super itchy and I suddenly I felt a stinging feeling, took the item off and sensor shaped burn on my arm. After a week it peeled and discoloration went away.",1
3950,How can you have a sleep tracker that can't make it through two nights in a row without being charged. I have also had BMI done as part of marathon training and the body weight scales are more accurate. This is an embarrassing product to launch given everything else in the market. I am shocked people are giving this more then 2 stars.,1
3951,"Enjoyed it during the membership trial, but once it expired it’s kind of useless. Not going to pay for a membership. Rather change back to an Apple watch were features come standard (as it should be).",1
3952,"I’ve had 2 of these break in less than 4 months. The sensor falls off after 1-3 months of regular use. When I contacted Amazon to replace the first one, I was put through customer service chat hell for over 2 hours. I won’t be replacing the 2nd broken one.",1
3953,"Charger broke within 2 weeks of use and wasn’t able to get a replacement because of no stock, very disappointed. battery died quickly with voice analysis on. Steps were also higher count than Apple Watch when worn at the same time. The body analysis also didn’t accurately represent my body shape. Product needs a lot of improvement",1
3954,Horrible quality.  I really liked this band while I was using it but it just fell apart one day.  Not even 4 months old.  Amazon also doesn’t make support easy.,1
3955,I was not happy with the accuracy of the halo.,2
3956,I returned it because it wouldn’t stay charged long enough. I would have to spend time charging it before bed and at least another time through the day. I bought an Apple Watch after and that keeps charge much longer. Can’t speak to any other part of the halo tracker just that the battery life isn’t great.,1
3957,"I initially loved this product as the sleep tracker and steps counter was the best. After about 2.5 weeks of wearing it,  i realized my wrist was hurting.  When I took it off,  I saw my wrist had a burn mark.  Never showered in it, leading up to that day I hadn't even slept in it.  Very disappointed.",1
3958,"Really good at first , but it doesn’t tie anything together , what I hate the most of this Fitness Band  is that the battery only lasted 1.5 day , I got this as it has no screen as I like wearing my watches",1
3959,"It stopped working about 2 weeks in. I couldn’t reset, turn on or off. Unfortunately I had medical emergency that needed surgery, and I missed the window to return it. I was so extremely excited for it, the idea and potential is there, but just not reliable and I’m so disappointed I wasted money.",1
3960,The app has been glitching since January. I’ve made three calls to customer service and received none of the follow up as promised. The last CSR said I’d be receiving a refund. That was a week ago. I’m in treatment for breast cancer and trying to improve my health and lower my stress. Amazon boo!,1
3961,I don’t like how the band fit .,2
3962,"I'm very tech-savvy and after two hours and numerous attempts to pair it with my phone, it never did. Very frustrating directions. One set comes with the device and another set is sent to you via email. I'm done. It's going back.",1
3963,Easy to wear,5
3964,Worst Amazon buy yet. Thought it would be cool but the charger broke after 5 weeks and customer service wasn’t helpful said the item was out of stock. I bought my friend one and am using their charger. It doesn’t update and the battery life os very short. Wouldn’t buy it again and we have 2,1
3965,delivered as promised,5
3966,i like everything,5
3967,I love Amazon Halo,5
3968,"I like the sleeping tracking and some of the concepts, but the band constantly loses its connection to the app and needs to be deregistered. Yes, I have tried all resetting the band, hard stop of the app, cycling power on the phone. Once you deregister the band, the data gets wiped. Very frustrating to use.",1
3969,"This is a great concept and I was excited to start using every function, but it is so uncomfortable to wear that I couldn’t make it past a three hour trial run.  Maybe it’s just my wrist or all women’s wrists, but I cannot imagine how this made it past product testing when it feels like this.",1
3970,"The green LED stopped working almost immediately but I didn't care so much about that, now, about 3 weeks into wearing it it refuses to charge anymore.Don't waste your money on either this or fitbit products.  Overpriced junk.",1
3971,I wanted to like this tracker. I really liked the way that activity level was measured. For the price the tone of voice analysis was important to me. I was sent a replacement tracker and the tone feature still did not work. I got a refund and purchased a cheaper fitness tracker that has watch face screen.,1
3972,It works,5
3973,"I REALLY wanted to love this product! It's Amazon....this band is representing a brand! However, right out of the package, I had difficulty maintaining connectivity with the app; it continually disconnected, losing all data.  The data that had been turned over, on occasion, was extremely off. I think this product has a lot of potential....but right now, I'm out.",1
3974,I like,5
3975,Data tracked is limited and not terribly useful.,2
3976,"The product definitely needs improvements. It only tracks sleep at night and doesn’t account for naps or sleeping at odd hours. The tracking device often leaves rash marks or burns on my skin when I forget to take it off. Overall, I’m unsatisfied with the quality of the product and would definitely opt for a Fitbit or Apple Watch instead.",1
3977,"This is Halo band #3 and many hours spent on the phone with customer support, many times just disconnected  by customers rep, who give up trying to resolve issue of the third band not working or connecting to Bluetooth. I am done",1
3978,"I hate to take my review down from a 4 to 1 star, but the device stopped working recently. Won't connect to the blue tooth on my phone, the button doesn't seem responsive on the device at all. Rather disappointed, enjoyed aspects of the device when it was working.",1
3979,After suffering with low battery life the charging system failed and now this device is not working anymore. There are not options in my order to return the item and get my money back. Poor design and poor support. AMAZON can do better than this.,1
3980,Terrible product. Worked for about a week and then it stopped synching with my iphone. Nothing I did could get it to work again. Ordered replacement and that too was garbage. Didn’t spend any actual $ on this as I got it through a promotion but for an Amazon product it is utterly abysmal,1
3981,Do not buy this.  I purchased for several of the features.  3/4 of the time the heart rate monitor does not even work.  I used this for one day.  I want a refund.,1
3982,"I guess I expected too much from an Amazon product.  I row: it doesn't measure my rowing; I sleep: it's sleep monitor is useless, and it's wrist band is the hardest wristband I've every had to deal with.  As a senior citizen, I should have known better. So I'll pass it along to you.",1
3983,1. worked for 2 weeks2. the band blows - buy it and you'll see what I mean3. sleeping on it is uncomfortable and can make your wrist hurt4. it's functionality is entertaining at best5. save your money and buy something higher quality that isn't just being used as a test case loss leader for Amazon,1
3984,"I really wanted to love it, but I dont.The band is very uncomfortable.The sleep tracking sometimes works and sometimes doesnt.The activity tracking is also very poor. Nothing like losing activity ""points"" because I work remotely and am stuck at a desk.I would not buy this again.",1
3985,"This is the worst amazon produced product ever. If you develop a deep learning algorithm, you don't deploy it for something as important as person's health without proper clinical studies.",1
3986,"I’ve had this a little over a month and the band looks ratty already. The app is ok… nothing too exciting. I had high expectations coming from Amazon. I’m out of my return window by a few days, also frustrating…",1
3987,"Disappointing purchase. Got in on the early bird special and the sleep monitoring is already not working. There was a lot effort put into offering unique capabilities, but they have all fell short of expectations. At this point the only thing that is working as expected is the activity tracking. $70-100 for a step tracker :-(",1
3988,I have enjoyed my Amazon Halo Band until is stopped charging and connecting to the internet and bluetooth on my phone.  I only had my band for 6 months.,1
3989,Love it,5
3990,Love it!,5
3991,"I had problems with pairing, battery life, all-around usage. What's worse is calling Amazon was painful in that there are just not enough people there that understand how the device works so if you have problems, they are little to no help at all. Mine is going back tomorrow, sticking with technology that actually works.",1
3992,Battery dies fast,5
3993,I've only had for a few short weeks and it completely died and would not reset.  After I said I wanted a refund they agreed to replace.  We'll see how long this once lasts.  I will say that the sleep app is great and mobile app is too.  The body scan not so much.,1
3994,good product,5
3995,"Overall, truly disappointed. Battery life needs to be a top priority on design improvements. I was most interested in the tone feature, but it certainly didn’t live up to my expectations and exhausted the battery far too quickly.The programs were good concepts, but were not engaging enough to create new habits.",1
3996,STILL LEARNING,5
3997,Works great for me.,5
3998,"I was excited to be selected to receive the Halo to replace my Fitbit.  I like the design of the Halo and the concept behind the tracker, but performance was terrible.  It frequently lost connection with the app and just was not worth the irritation of constantly messing with the app and connectivity.",1
3999,"This thing is garbage. I wanted it to track my sleep, and I thought it was doing well,  but it's way off. The last three nights I've slept like garbage, waking up every three hours, and yet this stupid thing still says I slept ""GREAT,"" well over eight hours. I'm done with it.",1
4000,"The halo did not work, I am not sure if it was defective. But I talked to a costumer service rep and did everything the said he would could not get it to work properly.",1
4001,"Feels like a spying device, honestly don't feel comfortable wearing something that's always listens to me and not been shy about it. I think it's a very suspicious move considering all the (spy) rumors about amazon Alexa products over all. +Now it knows exactly how you look naked so good sleeping knowing that!",1
4002,The device stopped charging after 3 months. The charging unit was always a challenge and pretty janky. I’m past the return period so out $60. Thanks Amazon for stealing my money.,1
4003,I had this for 8 weeks before it would no longer charge. Don't waste your time or money on this cheap Amazon branded garbage.,1
4004,"I love most all Amazon products but this one fell short, really doesn't do anything more or less than any other bands I've worn and the charging is limited to just using your computer they dont give you an option to charge to a wall out let and instructions are vague short and missing details",1
4005,I've been trying to cancel the subscription to this device and I've been transferred to five different people and no one seems to know how to cancel the subscription.  It's just a device I don't like and I don't want to be billed for the subscription when the free trial is up.,1
4006,"It’s uncomfortable, inaccurate and the info provided on the app is not worth the subscription price- especially since it seems to only give generic suggestions that are geared towards the masses, and not based on your stats and info. Don’t waste the money. Use your Apple Watch or Fitbit. Both offer better, more accurate features than this.",1
4007,The main feature of voice recognition didn’t work and I didn’t find it worthwhile at all. Why would they not have added a basic time display? The lack of display is another major constraint,1
4008,"It was a good product until 5 months in, battery started draining in a few hours. They refused to replace. Dont waste your money on a product Amazon doesn't even replace... the user manual says 12 month warranty but customer service says tough luck...",1
4009,"Sleep tracking is not accurate (compared to my other two sleep tracking devices, Garmin and Whoop). However, the Halo band is the most comfortable out of the three devices. I am returning; maybecwill purchase again when the Halo sleep algorithms improve...",1
4010,Great,5
4011,i woke up to my arm burning. I took the halo off to find a giant burn bubble which popped and now i have a giant burn hole on my wrist.Update: I went to the dr and confirmed it was a corrosion burnlooks like a volcano.  severe and deep,1
4012,I tried to love the concept but I didn't like the design and how bulky it is when you were that at night. I think Amazon should design something much lighter than when you were and sleep you don't feel it. Look forward for some improvement. I want my money back,1
4013,Need credit please,5
4014,I love it.,5
4015,"This device as the possible to be great, it is hard to use.  All the information you wish to exam has to be done on your phone. Get a Fitbit at least you can see the time and your step on that device. Just do not waste your money",1
4016,Great,5
4017,I was very happy with the sleep function and I was beginning to use it in about 30 days when I had an issue. With tech support had another issue got with tech support and got tired of having issues and I went and bought the Samsung Galaxy watch instead,1
4018,It just didn't work like its suppose to. And I ended up not really using it much. My Samsung health watch and app work better. And there is a membership you will have to pay for in the future in order to use it. Overall not really worth it.,1
4019,The battery only last 2 days,2
4020,"If I could actually get it to sync, I might have something positive to say. But I’ve had it for a few months and the only help Amazon offered was a “how to sync” email. The app told me that. But it won’t sync so I have no use for it.",1
4021,My family works nights our normal sleep schedule is to sleep 5am-1pm. I woke up to having lost points. I contacted Amazon and since I don't sleep in Amazon's primary sleep time of 5pm-8am I lose points. Waking up for the day to already failing for the day causes me stress.,1
4022,Works great,5
4023,I returned this product because it was inaccurate on all readings. I also have a Samsung watch that I know gives accurate readings on all accounts and the Amazon halo never matched the readings. It would also pick up on voices when nobody was speaking or pick up on my TV shows.,1
4024,The Halo band is the biggest pile of garbage. The metrics and monitoring are not accurate. The band fell apart in less than 6 months. I expected more from an Amazon branded product. Disappointed in the hype. Don’t waste your money.,1
4025,Love it,5
4026,I found the product to be fine. Wish it had a clock on the front. Oh and if I wear it for too long I found that it did something weird to my skin where the charging dots touch my wrist. Not a fan of this at all... just submitted for a refund.,1
4027,This band is uncomfortable and caused me to have skin breakdown from under the sensor. The sleep tracking was not as accurate as my sleep number or withings sleep mat. They also have these challenges that can only be completed through partner videos like orange fitness. No apple health pairing.,1
4028,"The band stopped connecting no matter what I did, including attempting to hard reset it. Now it’s just gathering dust. Very disappointed.",1
4029,"Worked fine for a while until the back fell off.  I got a replacement under warranty, but the back fell of the replacement within a month.  Don't waste your money.",1
4030,Had to do a factory resetBecause halo stopped working when I got it to work again I lost my free 6 month free subscription and no one has been able to fix,1
4031,"Initially I gave this three stars. It doesn't deserve it.I got a new phone, and the app REFUSED to send me the activation code so the device is as useless as the customer service I withstood for WEEKS without help was.",1
4032,Very disappointed. I guess I expected  more. I have worn it for over a month. It doesn’t serve any real purpose.The voice function is uselessThe sleep function will say a great night when  it wasn’t and vis versaI should have bought the Apple Iwatch,1
4033,"Pretty much useless. Does nothing any other tracker does, and the things it does do aren’t executed well.  App is cumbersome and provides little information, voice tone analysis kills battery in one day.Whoop is MUCH better, and even it is half as good as the newer FitBits.",1
4034,Mine stopped working within two (2) months of careful wear and Amazon refused to exchange/refund the item. It was very difficult to get a hold of tech support. I do NOT recommend this band.,1
4035,"Short life - less than a week. I’m not talking about the battery life, it’s the connectivity. As far as I could remember, it recorded my activities for three or four straight days then after that no longer works. Tried to reinstall but the app doesn’t detect it.",1
4036,This product shouldn’t require a subscription. My free subscription is expiring soon and I’m absolutely going to cancel. I wouldn’t pay for the basic use of this when there is so much better on the market that doesn’t require monthly subscription costs.,1
4037,This band is great except the inside face of it keeps coming off Amazon sent me a new one once but it’s broken again:(,1
4038,Wore it 24/7 and it's laser began to make a hole on my skin afterseveral weeks.  Beware!I wish I could return.,1
4039,It was on some BS where like I was supposed to be a beta tester and get special pricing and it disappeared in the mail. I would love one of these now for that price for anything in the world.,1
4040,"The activity scores no longer work and customer service was of no help. It worked for a little less than a year, but now is essentially useless.",1
4041,Not interactive,2
4042,"Pretty horrible actually. Not accurate at all. Workout tracking is a joke and the charger is, in a word, terrible. Ended up waiting too long to return so I gave it away to someone who only wanted to track heart rate",1
4043,"Good tracker, needs feature updates ASAP",2
4044,"I was so excited to get this, but what a disappointment. The app is great & I had no issues. The problem, it says I'm asleep when I know for a fact I'm awake & that I'm awake when I'm asleep. Do yourself a favor & get a fitbit",1
4045,Only good for sleep tracking.,2
4046,Excellent product,5
4047,"I am a big Amazon product fan...normally.  But not with the Halo.  I have not been able to get it to consistently work.  It is unattractive looking (looks cheap).  If I were to spend money on a fitness watch, this would definitely NOT be it.",1
4048,I am a fitness tech junkie. I can’t have enough metrics to measure my fitness level. This device needs some serious upgrades. It is so basic in its functioning. The sleep tracking seemed way off. The voice recognition was not good. My WHOOP strap is much better.,1
4049,Really like the idea of what it can do but it could never track my sleep and inconsistent capturing heart beat. Called CS and we did hard reset but nothing improved. Too bad too cause I was excited to use.,1
4050,Amazon Halo wouldn’t charge! It is a piece of crap. I just bought it like a month ago. I returned all the parts of the Amazon halo. I received today just one refurbished part. I order a new Amazon Halo was expecting in a box! What a scam!,1
4051,"Although the Halo does well for tracking and keeping records of the results, it fell apart after a little more than 3 months’ usage.It isn’t worth the investment.Update: Amazon Customer Service contacted me about my low rating, and have yet to offer me a fix.",1
4052,"Honestly, waist of money. And a bit uncomfortable. I stop wearing it after about two weeks. I've been going to the gym for about 15 years (in 30). So its not a lack of discipline type thing.  The voice recognition doesn't give any usable data in my opinion.",1
4053,The App rarely prompts me for anything other than battery charged or needs charging. Somedays it can't sync with the ios app.  It has made no difference to me in anyway other than having to strap it to my wrist. Wish I had not paid for it,1
4054,Had a very hard time sync this with my phone.  My daughter still can’t get her to sync.  Always not sync with the mobile app.  Would not buy again,1
4055,"I lost my band after taking it off at a resistor, because there's no GPS and no sensor to keep reminding u your separating from your halo. I was out of luck! Maybe u will have better luck",1
4056,Perfect,5
4057,"I've been using my halo band for just short of 4 months. It abruptly stopped working and Amazon has basically said the return period is expired, tough luck. Features were just OK.  Suggest you stay with a known entity like Fitbit that supports their products",1
4058,Product requires a subscription,2
4059,"The charge barely lasts a day. Even with the tone feature disabled. The body scan is gimmicky and the app has a whole lot of useless labs. Considering that there is no display, that is this seems to be a serious fitness tracker, the battery performance is atrocious.",1
4060,"I've never been able to get this to work. For the longest time, it wouldn't connect to my phone. It did after this last update, and the microphone doesn't work. Go to set it up and holding the button down unpairs it instead.This thing is garbage.",1
4061,It won’t charge,1
4062,I have done everything and I am very Tech savvy. I have started over per the instructions and done everything else I know to do and still it’s just a waste of $74,1
4063,I bought this for the body scan function. Worked once and cannot get it to work again after repeated tries in all different lighting environments. Very frustrating. Little to no support available online. Missed my return window or this thing would be going back.,1
4064,"It's started off ok, my wife was unsure at first. We both have galaxy watches and honestly those are way better. Wish I could get my money back!!! Don't buy!",1
4065,no red light when charging.,1
4066,"Won't charge. Charger was always finicky, but now my band will not charge at all. No way to tell if it is the charger or the halo band.",1
4067,Want to use this product to keepUp with my vital signs and I couldn’t get pass how to login. I really want this product.,1
4068,Very basic platform,2
4069,"Loved the Halo until it died on me just a few months after purchasing. I used it normally,  never abused it, kept it cleaned and charged.  It just went wonky on me, conveniently right after the return window closed.",1
4070,"Contacts on charger are not connecting with the tracker, it will not charge. Poor design, would not buy again.",1
4071,"I can't use the Halo at all because every time I sign in to the app it freezes and I am unable to see or do anything, I think I am going to have to return it.",1
4072,Don’t buy,1
4073,I returned this item. The battery life was horrible. It barely tracked my workouts. It would tell me I sounded irritated when I wasn’t speaking (maybe it picked up voices on the tv rather than my own?). I am much happier with my Fitbit.,1
4074,"The advertisement is all about how it helps build healthy habits. But if you start a 21 day challenge, and do it 3 days in a row, it marks it as complete and stops reminding you. This doesn't help at all!",1
4075,"It was great until I had to recharge it.  And then it wouldn’t recharge.  And I tried and tried and tried - and it wouldn’t recharge.  So now it’s like a disposable razor, but that isn’t what I wanted. It’s junk.",1
4076,If you exercise at all - this is NOT for you. I met my weekly goal on day one. Don’t buy this.  You can’t even use it as a watch.,1
4077,This product was ok while it lasted but stopped syncing and recording data 3 months in. Good idea in theory but needs work waste of money.,1
4078,"The HALO device is inferior quality to Apple watch, garmin and fit bit. charger stopped working after  initial charge and the unit sync function not as accurate as Apple watch .",1
4079,"The electronic part of the band fell off.  I wasn’t able to get a replacement from Amazon.  They charged me a restocking fee, claimed no replacement was available, and basically told me there’s nothing they can do.  WTF, it’s THEIR product?!",1
4080,It doesn't charge and once it does the data it collected is not the best.Very disappointed.,1
4081,Stopped working after less than 10 weeks. Didn’t even make it thru the free trial period. Does NOT accurately measure activity and is questionable with sleep tracking. Tried syncing as instructed by tech support and still didn’t resolve the problem. Thoroughly unimpressed.,1
4082,"I wouldn’t recommend this product. The battery life is way to short, it isn’t accurate with the activity measurement and the “mood” evaluation is not accurate or helpful.  Also a monthly prescription fee is just too much for what the device has to offer.",1
4083,"I wore this device and it gave me a rash on my wrist.  I stopped wearing it for a few days.  Tried it on again and the rash came back in one day.  I would not recommend this device, sorry to say.",1
4084,"While this gizmo does a nice job tracking sleep and steps, the sensors BURNED my wrist after wearing for less than 48 hours. And 5 days later, that spot on my skin is still scaly and flaking. I will never wear this again.",1
4085,"I had a feeling this thing wasn't very accurate so today, I hiked 1 mile around a track and checked.... it read 100 steps taken. I don't need something that helps me fail. The sleep monitor is the only thing that seems to work correctly.",1
4086,"My Iphone says i average 10,000 steps but the bracelet says 15,000-17,000 so it’s kind of weird and the sleep tracking doesn’t work. It’s a pretty heart monitor but not what was expected.",1
4087,The sleep tracker in the halo didn't work properly and failed to record the time it took for me to go to sleep.,1
4088,"This would not properly connect for charging.  The connection to my phone, a brand new pixel five was not reliable.  I've spent too much time already trying to make this work to care about it.  Returning to Amazon.  Clearly half baked",1
4089,"In the beginning the function was good.  But 3 month into tracking, inaccurate, will not pull data, keeps saying no data.  Have charged every day.  requires longer and longer time to recharge.  no longer will not sync.",1
4090,Don’t like it doesn’t work I reset and reset and what ever manual said only worked one day first day at gym,1
4091,Just a disaster,2
4092,Bought it hoping it would be a stand in for a Whoop. It’s worse in every possible way. The only good thing about it is that the sleep tracker is ok. I won’t be keeping it & I DEFINITELY won’t be paying for a subscription.,1
4093,I received this item as a gift from WWand it ended up it was to be charged to meafter so many months!!,1
4094,The device is okay at best & has several accuracy faults in my opinion. My rating is based on the charger becoming defective within 6 months 2 weeks. 2 weeks after the support window closed.,1
4095,So horribly dissapointing. It’s got way less functionality than my Apple Watch series 2. Just a super duper basic hr tracker. A total waste of money. It’s tough to describe how dissapointed I am. Coulda got 3 months of WHOOP instead,1
4096,I dont like how when it gets wet it makes me have to dry off that part individually.  The Body comp was a complete failure. So basically useless for me now. It really doesnt have anything more than competitors.,1
4097,I didn't get the six months membership i was promised,1
4098,"I really think this app has no use. The sleep time and intensity are variable and not actually the results I know (from experience and other devices). Steps are miscalculated and intensity of exercise doesn't measure what I know. All-in-all, avoid this band until it develops better interfacing and better explains measurement methods.",1
4099,"I purchased to replace a fitness band. The Halo product has fewer features, poor battery life and the mobile app drains the smartphone battery. I sent it back for a hassle free refund. There really isn’t anything good to say about the Halo.",1
4100,"Problems with syncing, have to turn  Bluetooth off and on turn to sync or check heartbeat, super disappointed, I love Amazon, but it’s been a total waste of my money!!!",1
4101,"I loved the features of the halo band and recommended it to so many people, then the part of the device broke off and I had no way to get product support since I'm well passed my return window.",1
4102,It stopped working after a few months. It won’t sync with app. W/o membership is pretty is a useless device. And can’t return it. And they started charging for a membership automatically! I’m beyond mad!,1
4103,"Awful, wanted to love it. Hate it. It is so uncomfortable to wear that even if the features were amazing I wouldn’t use it. I have tried and tried but it always ends up giving me wrist problems.",1
4104,Product stopped syncing after about 2 months.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this device.  Largely useless from my experience.  I've been an avid user of Amazon devices over the years and I'd put this in the category with the Amazon Fire Phone.,1
4105,Like a lot about this but it doesn’t really matter because it fell apart. The back came off while I was wearing it and I do not abuse this thing or get it wet. Boo.,1
4106,"I wanted to see my heart rate at different times during the day, and during workouts.  This records my heartrate very low, and my steps very high.  I  do not take 38,000 steps per day, but this device thinks I do.",1
4107,"After 6 months of use, I got frustrated with having no screen. Just bought a fitbit charge 4 to replace it. Voice tone is cool but still not very useful and wastes battery a lot.",1
4108,"Terribly irritated my skin, I own several watches including smart watches and never experienced anything like that. I like everything else about it but I would rate it 0 stars if I could as it's totally unusable for me.",1
4109,The protective covering on the underside of the band fell off and the device no longer tracks sleep or heart rate making it useless. Hardware is even worse than FitBit Charge 2.,1
4110,It's just a piece of fabric with a monitor on it. It would be better to get an actual watch.,1
4111,"I was very excited for the product. The features were great, but the charging station needs an update. The pins on the charging station bent after 1st charge. It is not easy to line up the pins on the charging station to the device.",1
4112,"Real issues with the app and the unit itself, sent back and refunded. There seems to be much work to get done if this is an alternative to the Fitbit. Had to reset constantly, would enable features and they would be gone",1
4113,It is by far the most uncomfortable health tracker I have ever owned . I’ve tried multiple bands and it’s the tracker itself that is uncomfortable,1
4114,Won't recharge. I guess this is the end of the road for me. Don't think it's worth buying another charger to try. Tried new clip under warranty. Still not charging. Customer service has been horrible.,1
4115,I am returning this item because it’s just boring and causes you to look at your phone all the time to see what it’s tracking. The weight body mass thing is kind of inaccurate as well. Decided to buy an Apple Watch,1
4116,It doesn’t even track your food intake which is what you really want in a fitness app.  How stupidMy birthday gift and want to send it back,1
4117,This item is crap. Does not work all the time. Only tracks my sleep 4 out of 7 days. I need something that works 100%!,1
4118,I had such high hopes for this. I thought the tone recognition would be helpful but it's really not as it doesn't take context of conversation into account. The biggest thing is it doesn't count calories,1
4119,I have an Apple Watch and like it better than the halo. If I wasn’t used to the Apple Watch I may have adapted better to the halo.,1
4120,"It’s just not worth it for anything but the sleep tracking. It has no advantages over other trackers, in fact with no display, it is disadvantaged.  If it hadn’t been free through my life insurance, I would be extremely disappointed.",1
4121,"It does not seem to work with the newest iPhone and when I contacted support, I was told they would get back to me and they have not. It's been a month.  I haven't even been able to use it yet.",1
4122,Loved it for six months but it stopped tracking fitness. I spoke with tech support weeks ago and no fix or follow up from them. Makes me rethink my 25+ year loyalty to amazon.,1
4123,waste of money. this should be included with my Amazon prime subcription. not helpful and does not work all the time. battery life does not last long amazon support is no help!,1
4124,"The activity tracker is good, but the rest was nonsense and horribly inaccurate. The heart monitor made my wrist ache. The pain disappeared a few days after I took it off.",1
4125,"Use to work, now it won't let me login to my account on the app 😒 😑 🙃 😕 . Tried multiple times, did all the steps oh well.",1
4126,"Cannot use it even with a low-intensity workout or just walking around, causing blisters, no matter wearing on wrist or ankle.",1
4127,This is a piece of crap. It doesn't integrate with any normal apps. So your steps can't be tracked outside of it. And the tone isn't working at all even though it says its on and calibrated. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!,1
4128,I thought this was going to be great especially with my love of amazon. But this product was sheer disappointment. It did NOT accurately track ANYTHING!,1
4129,Device is not accurate at all. App is a little wonky as well. Good try but maybe next time Amazon,1
4130,"I wish I could return this.  I can't even get it hooked up to the app, and yes I am proficient with electronics.  It's very hard to get on and now I'm reading how invasive it is.  No thanks!",1
4131,"Had this for 5 months and it's falling apart.  Never got it wet.  This costs too much for as little time I wore it.  Very disappointing!Other than that, I really liked it.",1
4132,I tried it. I guess it was good enough but it only lasted a few weeks because of this weird clip you have to dock it in to recharge. Having to ship it back knocks all the stars off this.,1
4133,"Tried with the first Halo. Did not track sleep or steps accurately. Called, they sent me a replacement at no extra charge. Same problem with the second Halo. This is a product that needed more work before releasing it to the public.",1
4134,I live in Costa Rica and I can not use this product here due to some sort of licensing. The Halo app is not available in the iTunes App store in Costa Rica.,1
4135,"Loved the Halo, but I only had it two days and the sensor fell off and was lost. Now, I have a hundred dollar bracelet that's useless. No way to return or replace without buying a brand new one. Beware.",1
4136,"The battery does not last long, it does not have an option in Spanish, I love the design. does not work outside the US. fail",1
4137,I forgot to wear it one night but it still tracked my sleep so I didn’t know what to believe I doubt was accurate,1
4138,"It left black marks on my skin. And when the tone feature is on, the battery doesn’t last 8 hours. It’s a great idea but this tracker isn’t for me. I need more features for tracking that this app doesn’t provide.",1
4139,Seriously was excited about this.  I couldn’t stop looking at it expecting to see the time.Got so annoyed I took it off and haven’t used it since.Feels like a watch- but won’t tell me the time.,1
4140,Zero stars! Worst purchase I've made in a long time! Battery life is two to three days max. It won't record tone and sleep. I have had to reset it multiple times already. Do not purchase! This product does not work!!,1
4141,"Gotta say I'm disappointed with this one. Love most of my alexa devices but this one is a dud. Sleep tracking is terrible,  active tracking is terrible.  Get a fitbit or Samsung,  light years ahead of this.",1
4142,"It is very new, laks alot of functions.Almost impossible to get hart rate plots. No consistent place.No synchronization to google fit.",1
4143,"I loved it at first, but the product stopped working before 6 months was even up.",1
4144,Update 2/3/21Was working freat for the first month ish then just stopped working. Doesn't track my sleep anymore and is very innacurate with the steps and points. I did heavy workouts with step intensity didnt even pick it up.,1
4145,The band was great but paid for a product to use for 6 months. Doesn’t seem fair that the product is faulty and I have to pay the price for that.,1
4146,I was fooled into buying this thinking it was a watch too.,1
4147,Plain and simple: stopped connecting with phone. Amazon doesn’t know why…..,1
4148,It doesn't have a GPS.It doesn't have a watch.It absolutely not worth the money.,1
4149,"I could not sych it to my phone or laptop, so I have nothing to say about it one way or the other.",1
4150,"Worthless piece of junk, difficult to re-pair without calling tech services at Amazon. Mine’s going in the trash or Goodwill.",1
4151,"The first Halo watch I received did not display heart rate. I replaced watch with second, but was unable to synch watch with my phone. Returned 2nd for refund. Very disappointed because on paper, product had all the features I wanted.",1
4152,Cheaply made product. Didn't last a year. Amazon customer service was confused about the damaged product and couldn't figure out how to process a replacement. I would not recommend this product.,1
4153,"Not worth the money. Basically a first generation Fitbit. If you already have an Apple Watch or a Fitbit, this is just white noise in the wearable tech world. I’m returning this. There’s nothing new to see here.",1
4154,When it breaks you still pay for service that you don’t get . And no one answers when you email,1
4155,I purchased this to monitor my sleep. Sadly it didn't work for me at all. It said I didn't sleep at all.,1
4156,"Got bored with it after a few weeks. Took it off, threw it in a drawer, deleted the app, and now I'm wishing I would have returned it in time. And still making payments! Great job Mr Bezos.",1
4157,This is my 3rd Halo! They are great when they work. Unfortunately they stop working often and no refund is offered!!!!,1
4158,Nice tracker pretty accurate on sleep and steps but..... wrist band are not very secure have used both styles of band and tracker falls out of bandNow it’s 3 months later and tracker is gone in the snow,1
4159,"Stops syncing with iPhone after two weeks. Tried everything, resetting, exchanged the band, followed all the steps in the instruction. It helped for a week only. Can't return as passed 30 days. Pulse meter is very inaccurate",1
4160,I've been talking to different people about my halo acc. I just got..... long story. Call me with an American voice. I'm ready to send this back.,1
4161,I liked it until it stopped syncing. Amazon would not help with trOuble shooting and would not process return.,1
4162,"This thing is great when it works but it drops connectivity every.single.day. No, it does not save your data. I would return mine but I missed the return date by one day. I am very disappointed in this device.",1
4163,"Compared to other health devices this one is pretty terrible and inaccurate.  Battery life is poor.  The tone feature is bizarre and doesn’t give actionable insights, the body fat percentage is very inaccurate compared to InBody machines.",1
4164,"The device quit after less than a month. It wouldn't sync up with my phone's bluetooth. Contacted tech support who immediately offered me a refund. While I appreciated the quick response, I was very disappointed in this device.",1
4165,"After a few months, my Halo band stopped charging. I am trying to get support so I can use the band, but without it being able to take a charge it is not a very valuable wearable.",1
4166,"The band does not properly track your heart rate. I have multiple monitors tracking HR at the same time, and the Halo band will be 50-60bpm off from the other trackers. Do not waste your money buying this product.",1
4167,The link between the device and the app is very poor if you're not paying attention all the time  no data is collected.,1
4168,"My band stopped charging about 60-90 days after purchase. The charging mechanism really is awful, and there is virtually no support. Used to love wearing it, but it’s useless now.",1
4169,"Needs a lot of work and development. Never synced well, never tracked sleep well, never tracked heart rate well. Inaccurate across the board. Needs a WHOLE lot of work to catch up to the fitness trackers out there! Returned.",1
4170,charging interface seemed flaky at first and now confirmed... band no longer charges and now a useless armband.definitely wait until they redesign with something that most other widgets know how to do well...,1
4171,I can’t even get it to update and sync to phone to start trying to use it... as far as I’m concerned it’s crap in the drawer I wasted money on.  I’ll stick with my Apple Watch,1
4172,Tried for 30 days to capture body composition picture...no luck.  Cameramust be in specific position and user must match screen image outline. Never able to match screen image position eventhough all body parts were inside the lines.,1
4173,This did not follow the hype that I had read. I have been unable to get it connected with apps I need. It was a great idea but it didn’t work for me!,1
4174,"Seriously terrible compared to the competition. More expensive, less features and relies on the app for anything it does. Then charges a subscription? But a fitbit, you get a screen, alarm, and everything else this offers.",1
4175,F****** JUNK! Does not do anything. I’ve tried for three days. It will not track your sleep or count steps..  I wouldn’t buy if I were you!! Get a Fitbit.,1
4176,Purchased as a Christmas gift and it has already stopped working.  Of course it stops working a week after the return window closes as well.  Would recommend not purchasing because it is not going to last.,1
4177,Don’t waste your money. Got the first one in October they had to replace it in November 9 months later stopped working…. Will not charge useless,1
4178,"I couldn’t get the app to download, so I never used it.  Being wary of new products, I decided to return it before losing my money.",1
4179,"Item was good at start after couple weeks my skin where the monitor sits started to burn, itch, the get really red.",1
4180,"It worked fine for approximately 3 months, then quit. There is no tech support to be found in the app or on the packaging.",1
4181,"Poor battery life even with the tone at lowest level. Not worth the money. I got this in hopes it would be better than the Fitbit, but I was wrong. Going back to the Fitbit.",1
4182,It broke by month 5 just like a cheap fit bit. One day someone will make one that last longer than 18 months.,1
4183,"Stopped syncing to my phone and I am few days past the return window. Tried seeking help from Amazon, not a good product not worth the money especially since it only worked for 2 months.",1
4184,Did a good job of racking activity and sleep effectiveness.  Voice tone feature was not so useful.  Stopped working three weeks after the return window expired.  No warrantee period.  Wasted my money.,1
4185,I am seriously disappointed in this product. It’s not very accurate and not very user friendly. I love most Amazon branded products but this one will be replaced with a FitBit as soon as possible.,1
4186,It’s really a nuisance sine you always have to use your phone . It does track my sleep nightly. It’s kinda bulky to sleep in. I wish I never made this purchase.  The band is cute,1
4187,I scrolled the internet on the couch for 4 hours when I couldn't sleep and it registered me as light and rem sleep,1
4188,"Mine just fell apart. I’ve had it for 10 months. Most of the features don’t work, especially the body scan and tone features.",1
4189,Complete waste! Features are not useful enough for ongoing use and does not appear to warrant the additional subscription service cost. Used it for approximately two weeks and quit using it. Wish I could return it.,1
4190,Just poorly done. A lot of features but basic functionality is bad,1
4191,"I bought this as a birthday present for myself and was happy with the performance until it mysteriously stopped working one morning. I've tried to return/exchange it, but Amazon refused. Such a disappointment.",1
4192,I bought this product specifically to monitor my sleep pattern. It does not accurately record my sleep pattern and I have trouble getting it to activate.,1
4193,It really needs a display. Mine quit charging after 2 months of use. Without paying for features I dont need it becomes a Fitbit with no clock.,1
4194,It’s an inferior product. Tracking sleep is its worst feature especially when you found out it didn’t track any sleep data at all. I will give this a miss and save the money on something else.,1
4195,Cheap product. I was afraid of wearing it since the band looked so cheap. Didn’t track my sleep. Syncing had to be done manually. I wouldn’t recommend.,1
4196,I read all the forums and it is true charging the Halo is impossible!!!  I would stick with the Fitbit.,1
4197,Just a rip-off. I don't want to say any more about it. It is a way to take your money for a device that will not work. I thought Amazon was better than that. THEY AREN'T.,1
4198,This thing is silly. I was so excited to get it thinking it was more like an Apple Watch. Total waste of money and there’s always problems with it loading. Don’t do it.,1
4199,This device does not keep a charge.  It does not stay connected.  Needs a lot of work. I would like to send back and get reimbursed. Had to go back to my Fitbit.,1
4200,"This was a great tracker I absolutely loved everything except it stopped working around 5 months. It was good while it lasted, it just didn’t hold up.",1
4201,I wasn’t thrilled with this product. The battery life was terrible. It didn’t even last 24 hours. The voice analysis wasn’t very accurate and the pedometer was way off. Needs some definite work before it’s ready.,1
4202,My 30 dollar Honour band is waaaay better.  Not worth the money.,1
4203,I found this product useless.  Won't stayed synced.  Many times it did not pick up my sleep pattern.  I have a much cheaper version that gave me much more feedback.,1
4204,WOULD NEVER STAY CONNECTED. ID SPEND 30 TO 45 MINUTES TRYING TO REESTABLISH A CONNECTION EVERY TIME.NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING WORTH THE EFFORT.SMASHED IT AND THE CHARGER WITH A HAMMER. GOOD RIDDANCE!!!!!!!!!!,1
4205,After wearing this for a few days I developed a rash on my arm where the base touches my arm. I have not been able to resolve the issue.,1
4206,"I wanted to like it, I tried to like it, I gave it weeks. It just wasn’t a a good way to track activity for me. The points system sucks.",1
4207,"I was loving it, but then it stopped charging. I was only able to use it for a week. I tried to get a hold of customer service and no reply. That was a month ago!!",1
4208,It never tracked my sleep. I kept having to resync it to my phone.,1
4209,"Only function that works properly is the sleep function.  The voice tracking rarely works regardless of the setting. Quite disappointed, since this was the feature I was looking forward to the most.",1
4210,One of the most disappointing products I have ever bought from AMAZON. The bracelet never charges and the stats are not impressive. I would not buy this and stick to the whoop or Apple Watch.,1
4211,Sleep tracker took 4 days to set up. Then says I sleep 8-10 while I am at work.,1
4212,"I’ve written many positive reviews on Amazon products, deservedly so.  This was a total waste, and wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.",1
4213,I woke up yesterday 4/12 and the Halo band was broken.  The cover of the sensor that rests on the wrist became unattached and now it is not usable :(,1
4214,"The only thing that is a plus is the band.  Fitbit is better. The halo body scan didn't work, and the recording device is just creepy. Halo was also on Black Mirror, just sayin.",1
4215,"Never worked, doesn't hold or take a charge, If love one that lives up to the hype, it says change the battery but it's a rechargeable permanent battery.",1
4216,"Made me feel like all of my conversations were being listened in on. And I felt the analysis of my tone was alway inaccurate. Also no watch face, which is ... come on...",1
4217,"I threw my Halo in the trash. Sometimes it worked, other times it didn’t. Very inconsistent. According to the Halo I never sept at night, even though I wake up refreshed every day.",1
4218,This is our second Halo band. The first started leaking a grease type substance and was returned. Shortly after getting a replacement the new one stopped working all together. The base protective cover came off.,1
4219,Super disappointed this piece of equipment just fell apart yesterday.  I've had it since just before Christmas and never thought it would fail in fewer than 6 months. Boo,1
4220,Don’t waste your time and money with this product that Amazon doesn’t care about. It doesn’t work. Don’t buy it.,1
4221,Worthless. Sounds so great but horribly inaccurate.  I really wanted it to work but my heart rate working out is closer to 160 than the 70-80 device shows in app.,1
4222,"I loved this product when it was working. However, after 2 months of normal usage, the device won't charge anymore. I even bought another charging clip to test it out. No luck on that.",1
4223,"Cool idea but poor execution. Would only stay charged for 4-5 hours, even with the ""tone"" feature turned off.Ended up returning.",1
4224,I returned twice first time it stopped working they issued me a new one and after a month the second one stopped working plus it had to be charged a few times a day,1
4225,Took 48 hours for it to charge then wouldn't charge past 94% and would be dead by the next day. Returned for refund.,1
4226,I would give this 0 star if I could. After you buy it you have to keep paying to use it. I'm returning mine.,1
4227,It constantly stopped synching with my phone app causing me to reset the entire device over and over. I don’t think it’s very reliable  and I would not purchase this again.,1
4228,"Good design in general with major flaws.Ugly chunky charger, very unstable device, loses sync occasionally, no real value compared to other alternatives.Body tracking is worrisome.",1
4229,"Can't hold a charge more than a day ... useless ... bodyfat measurement equals taking a selfie and getting an approximation from the app, how misleading. I had high expectations Amazon. What a disappointment.",1
4230,This product was impossible to setup and it looks and feels cheap.  Very dissatisfied and disappointed. I am not getting a replacement.,1
4231,Will not pair with any device. Ordered this twice and both did not work.,1
4232,After two days the Halo would not sync with my phone.  Do not waste your time with this device.,1
4233,Don’t waste your moneyPulse is never accurateYou have to be an octopus on ice skates to use the body fat featureMy Fitbit is lighter more accurate ...and tells time!!!,1
4234,I wish I would have started using my halo immediately! I waited too long and now I cant return it. I had high expectations for this product but it didnt deliver.,1
4235,Don't waste your money,1
4236,I was hoping for more then me smart watch did and it dose less. I guess if you don't have any type of tracker this would be a expensive way to go.cshirkey5563@msn.com,1
4237,Does not work. Constantly have to factory reset device which takes multiple steps to do. You wear it only to discover it’s not collecting data. Going back to my Fitbit.,1
4238,"Literally broke 2 days after it was eligible for return or replacement. Might as well have set cash on fire to keep warm, it would have at least lowered my heating bill.",1
4239,"I am glad I didn't have to pay for it.  It does not fit right, always says its too tight or too loose without even adjusting, doesn't register things correctly",1
4240,Does not work the way I needed,1
4241,This was so upsetting. It didnt do anything that I wanted it to do. It never was able to capture my full body picture so without that nothing worked correctly. So upsetting,1
4242,Stopped working after only 2 months.  When it was working the battery life was too short. Other than that I enjoyed the features however I won’t be replacing it.,1
4243,After barely two months of working it the back popped off while I was Waring it!,1
4244,"It status,on the charger daily. Should have purchased a Fitbit",1
4245,In the long run an Apple Watch is gonna be cheaper and gives you better accuracy when you workout and sleep and even tells you if your Heart rates too high or low.,1
4246,Won't sync anymore.  100 bucks down the tube.,1
4247,"Not accurate, sleep tracking was a joke. The app difficult to navigate and lacking in detail especially on voice tone. Could have been so much better. Maybe V2 will be better.",1
4248,I purchased this to track my sleep.  I know how little I slept the nights I tried it.  The records were way off.,1
4249,"If you wear it loosely, it doesn't track anything or misreports. If you wear it firmly around your wrist, it begins to burn your skin where the sensor comes into contact.",1
4250,This band hardly ever worked. Always shut off and wouldn’t turn on & I would have to reset it every time this happened. Waste of $ & time.,1
4251,Sleep tracking stopped working after a few  months.  Don't know it you are actually charging it because it doesn't light up anymore,1
4252,Terribly disappointed.  It won’t charge.  It worked for a month and died.  Did all the troubleshooting and it still won’t work.  Terrible design on charging.,1
4253,I've had halo for 2 months. It now holds a charge for 2 hours. Junk.,1
4254,THE WORST PIECE OF CRAP I EVER PURCHASED.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE.  NEVER WORKS.  DO NOT BUY.,1
4255,Very intrusive from a privacy perspective. Body fat % estimate was off considerably compared to more standard measures. Sleep tracking no better than other options that are far less intrusive.,1
4256,Unless Amazon changes this fitness tracker I would never buy one again. Battery wouldn't even make it thru my 8 hour work day.,1
4257,"Do not buy this product, it is 100% junk.  Ive had mine since October and it no longer tracks steps, or stays charged.  Fitbit is way better",1
4258,"It stopped logging my activity after one month using it, and customer service says I have to restart the app and the band EVERY TIME this happens, which is completely absurd.",1
4259,I like the look of the band and it's features..it just caused a skin irritation on my wrist where the charging connectors are located...so I had to stop wearing it.,1
4260,"It does not stay charged for longer than a day, therefore doesn’t work for sleep tracking. The tone also seems pretty random and doesn’t really give you any good information.",1
4261,"I really liked the tracking on the halo, but after 3 months it just stopped working.",1
4262,Not impressed so far.  I had to reboot it and go back to factory settings this morning so it would sync / therefore it lost the history.....,1
4263,Got the Halo and it worked well for a few months.  Now it won’t charge and I cannot get any product support or assistance.  A total waste of money!,1
4264,"AppStore does not even show the app, it said it is not available for my region.",1
4265,This product worked great for a few months. New update in software June 2021 has not allowed to pair with my smartphone.,1
4266,No accurate. I have two other fitness trackers and this Amazon one was never accurate.Way over counts steps and sleep under counts hours.,1
4267,The device no longer pairs or works.  It stopped working three weeks in and I was able to reset now six weeks in and it will no longer reset.,1
4268,It's now in a little box for recycling.,1
4269,It just stopped connecting to my phone after the first night - the Halo device became invisible to my phone so I cannot use it or see anything from the app.,1
4270,"Sadly I am disappointed with the Halo, every time I plug in the charge all info disappears and I’m back to O for week.  Sleep is inaccurate...",1
4271,It quite working one month after warranty expired.,1
4272,The band won't hold a BT connection to the App.  I am forced to reset the band and lose all my history and data.  Very frustrating.,1
4273,Complete waste of money. Interesting functionality but no battery life.  I would rather have an analog pedometer. At least it would work 2 days in a row,1
4274,"Doesn't work without the app.The app is dysfunctional and uncooperative.'Tis now Past the end of the return window, so I guess it is mine.",1
4275,"I haven’t been able to get it to connect to Bluetooth/WiFi. I finally gave up. Had no trouble connecting my Fitbit, so I don’t know why this has been impossible.",1
4276,Liked it at first but found the voice analysis inaccurate. Now it won’t sync or charge. Want to return it.,1
4277,All the info did not sync. So I have to wait for the new one to arrive.  But it was accurate for sleeping.  Accurate for the exercise portion.,1
4278,"Expensive and limited integration with other health apps or devices, consumes a lot of power. Read the fine print, you will be charged a monthly fee after 6 months.",1
4279,"I didn't even turn it on was too tall..like bulky on my wrist..when I bent it was painfulI'm returning,I hear it not bad though for it's abilities..",1
4280,It was OK if you use it for walking. I needed it for bicycling so it really didn't help.,1
4281,Charger design is awful. It was a struggle to get it to charge for a few weeks and now won’t charge at all,1
4282,Does not work well,1
4283,Inaccurate in virtually everything it monitors and a battery life of about a day even with mic off.Purchased at intro 65 dollar price and still not worth the money.,1
4284,"Bent pins on charger, it’s definitely a design flaw. Amazon customer care denied a free replacement. Bad product.",1
4285,Sleep tracking never works and I have been working with someone practically from day one to try to get it to work and it’s the main reason I bought it.,1
4286,If I could get my money back I would. With no display you have to do everything through your phone.,1
4287,I don’t recommend this product. I have had it for 3 months and it is no longer working properly. Tone won’t work and activity does not record accurately.,1
4288,I could write 5 pages about why you shouldn't buy this product......price and quality are just two of them.....don't waste your time and money on this product,1
4289,Doesn't add anything different than any band. Price is outrageous for such a lacking band. Would never recommend.,1
4290,"It doesn't work.  We used it for a month and now nothing.  Flashes orange all day long.  Doesn't reset, doesn't pair.  It's useless.",1
4291,This is absolutely not what I was supposed to get and on top of it the package was smash and it looked like it was open and smashed,1
4292,The product is okay but the subscription service ruins it,1
4293,Not for athletes and I was under the impression it was more geared for people that are a littleMore serious about activity and goals.,1
4294,"Needs more charging than my fitbit, so far not impressed. Kinda sorry I spent $$. Give it a little longer but not much about so I like.",1
4295,The app seems a bit clunky. My big issue is that the battery dies within a day and the product isn’t even a year old.,1
4296,"One of the worst fitness trackers i have ever had, sleep data is way off, step counter is nowhere near accurate at all and battery life is horrible.",1
4297,I really liked the watch for the 2 months it worked. Now it won’t connect to my Bluetooth no matter what I do to try and correct it.,1
4298,Does not charge after less than a year of use. No way to get help.,1
4299,I do not think it is accurate and the interface is horrible. I did not see value in this product after I tried it so I stopped wearing it.,1
4300,"I enjoyed the halo while it was working- I ve had about two months and woke up to it being dead-  I couldn't sync ,charge, nothing....",1
4301,Didn’t work. Stopped syncing and wouldn’t reconnect. Tried for two days,1
4302,I retuned this unit and UPS picked it up.  I keep getting this email wanting to charge my credit card.  Filing a complaint with AE,1
4303,"Does what it says, but I have small wrists and this device is very bulky and was very uncomfortable. I returned it, but would not recommend.",1
4304,I guess I expected more I used it for about a month but my other wearable trackers were more useful. Especially cause they have a display.,1
4305,... I’m unimpressed. J.k I really love this tracker but I’m upset they wouldn’t let me post my original review so I guess you’ll just have to wonder....,1
4306,Doesn’t do anything helpful. Sleep tracking only works if you are up for more then 5-10mins. I could go on and on. Just not worth it.,1
4307,The Halo came but the charging cable was not in the box  box states charging included so was not able to use the item,1
4308,This was very hard to use.  Hard to get help.  No where near the Fitbit quality,1
4309,Don’t buy the app is perfect but the hardware is the worst. My bracelet broke in 2 weeks it wouldn’t charge,1
4310,This is a device best avoided. The sleep tracker is unreliable and the band stopped working after less than 3 months of use.,1
4311,Ni funciona en Latinoamérica,1
4312,Was good until the app stopped working. It crashes all the time so I cannot access my data. Band is worthless without the app.,1
4313,Didn't pair well.,1
4314,My halo has completely stopped working after 6 months.  I am completely disappointed in this item.,1
4315,"The heart rate monitor doesn’t read correctly when I’m doing any kind of fast, hard movements. This band is simply not designed for tracking high intensity workouts.",1
4316,No es nada de lo que esperaba y ademas cambie de telefono y todos mis datos se borraron,1
4317,"The sleep tracking doesn’t work, the tone tracking only occasionally works, and you’re constantly restarting the device so it will temporarily function. Piece of crap.",1
4318,so disappointed bought November and the piece under the band came off and quit working.  cannot contact halo for replacement,1
4319,"This will be returned. This device is too complicated for me to put together or use. All that hype, such a disappointment for me.",1
4320,Periodically disconnects for no reason and takes a lot of troubleshooting to get it to pair again,1
4321,"No long charges. Have only used it 3ish months. Looking at other questions asked and reviews, seems to be a common issue :(",1
4322,This product needs a lot. Compared to the whoop strap this thing is 2 out of 10. Extremely inaccurate sleep and performance info.,1
4323,Terrible battery life for something without a screen,1
4324,Returned due to steps being inaccurate,1
4325,"Dislike the app, always disconnects. If you use voice detection… it only last 16ish hours",1
4326,"Awful. Don't waste your time, multiple factory resets and still won't connect. Buy something, anything else.",1
4327,Device doesn't hold a  charge for long enough.  Also doesn't seem accurate.  The charger broke right after the warranty expired.,1
4328,"Started peeling apart after 6 months,  8 months stopped working",1
4329,Unfortunately I sent this back. It quit working after 42 days. It wouldn’t do a factory or connect back to app.,1
4330,My halo band doesn’t work!,1
4331,"I wore it for a about a week, then my wrist started to hurt and am feeling a pain in my heart",1
4332,"After about three weeks, battery won't charge past 79% and won't last more than 2 days between charges with the voice stuff off.",1
4333,Extremely difficult to find if it falls off the bracelet. Expensive lesson learned.,1
4334,The cover has come off. How do I return and or get this repaired? I'm actually enjoying the device.,1
4335,Second time this happened. Only after a couple months of use.This is clearly a cheaply made item di t bother.,1
4336,Battery life is poor. Has to be charged every 2 days.  Body Scan is inaccurate and challenging to get set up/pictures taken correctly,1
4337,"Do not buy it if you live outside USA, there is no way to get the app and use the device/",1
4338,I liked everything it did for about a week. Could sweat have affected it?,1
4339,After owning a fitbit this was disappointing,1
4340,Lasted less than a year. Battery fried tried every and won’t charge anymore,1
4341,Very frustrating.  Stopped syncing a week in.  I have rebooted and troubleshooted per all the suggestions.  Still will not sync.,1
4342,Title says it all. Important features are behind a paywall now. Wouldn't recommend.,1
4343,Dislike- does not give option to log live workout . Compared to whoop doesn’t have much individual based performance results.,1
4344,Its really worthless unless you are a novice.  Sits in a box.  Plus not worth paying for subscription.,1
4345,Loved it until it died... after 3 months.,1
4346,It was awful. I returned it and purchased an Apple Watch. The Fitbit is better and Apple Watch is the best.,1
4347,"Terrible at holding a charge, multiple resets.  Never worked properly so I returned it within a couple weeks.",1
4348,I tried contacting customer service and they did not help me at all. It quit charging so it’s literally useless now. Coooool.,1
4349,Not worth the subscription. Better off with an Apple Watch,1
4350,The battery life on this is horrible. Spent more te on the charger than my wrist.,1
4351,The app is terrible. Difficult to sync. Incorrect calorie tracker. Battery recharge gets progressively worse. Customer service also poor.,1
4352,simply unusable. I would say it's an unnecessary gadget.,1
4353,I've had my Halo for less than 4 months today it quit working and will no longer sync with my phone nor work.,1
4354,"I bough this product and after 4 months, the halo band disconnected and never worked again!",1
4355,Think Fitbit but Amazon should realize it’s a failure. All of the tracking features missed the mark. Buy a Fitbit.,1
4356,It kinda sucks! go with a more reputable brand. Your Welcome!,1
4357,This device is extremely inaccurate. I would strongly not recommend. It’s laughable at best.,1
4358,I liked the size. However it had too many glitches. I often wondered how accurate it was with its different measurements.,1
4359,Received this in December. It has never worked. Tried to get help but still not working. Big waste of money.,1
4360,What is the point of this watchless device? I have an old Fitbit 2 which tells me everything this new device can.,1
4361,Tone and body mass features not really useful. Would not pair with my phone after multiple tries.  Returning.,1
4362,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Broke after 2 months and can't get anyone at Amazon who can replace or fix it. I liked it fine for 2 months.",1
4363,This is cheap and worked on and off until it totally quit,1
4364,Just not up to the hype. Lacking connection to real usable apps which provide useful information for client use.,1
4365,I have had two halo watches and both only worked for a few months and then stopped working.,1
4366,Worthless. Broke - refused to charge - after six months. Theft.,1
4367,"Too bulky, don’t like to have to keep checking my phone to look up info, band isn’t what I thought scratchy.",1
4368,Pay a subscription monthly for eavesdropping? Nope! Analyze my voice/tone? No thank you! Huge fan of echo products but not this...,1
4369,Not accurate. Wore with my apple watch and not close. Doesn't auto track when I'm doing cardio exercise.,1
4370,Doesn’t work at all. Cannot even replace it with a new one since none are in stock.,1
4371,No compatibility with other apps... Big deal breaker for me,1
4372,This is the worst fitness band ever.  It is inaccurate and basically useless.  Don't buy this.,1
4373,Flawed in too many ways to list. I'm returning mine. I don't even want to give it away.,1
4374,"It would not stay charged, returned",1
4375,"Purchased in October of last year, and it has already stopped working. It no longer charges.",1
4376,Worked for like a week and then it wouldn't charge ever again. Just gave up basically.,1
4377,Would not pair.  No screen to debug.  After 2 weeks of trying - returned.,1
4378,It is an okay product but without membership is completely useless. They just want you to Pay the $4 every month. I haven't used it in months and I don't miss it. If you have $70 to trow away and want to pay like $50 a year go ahead and buy it.,3
4379,It seems like Apple Watch blows this out of the water.,1
4380,Was completely disappointed with this product. I had such high hopes and expectations after reading about it.,1
4381,How can I make it work in Perú ?,1
4382,only worked for a month then stopped working!! Can't return now...,1
4383,Requires a subscription because they can charge one and you are dumb enough to pay for it.,1
4384,Hated the product as it did not work for me at all. I am in the process of returning.,1
4385,This has to be by far the worst fitness tracker I’ve ever used. Don’t buy!,1
4386,Had high hopes for this. Half the time it won't connect and screws up the sleep tracking.,1
4387,You'll be sending this product back or troubleshooting it more than you'll be actually wearing it,1
4388,It wasn't the worst while it lasted.,1
4389,Worst fitness tracker I ever used. Just good for Amazon to track and spy on you for their gain.,1
4390,"Aside from the sleep tracking feature, it’s as basic as a fitness band gets, IMO.",1
4391,"only wore it for a week, better off getting a apple watch or whoop",1
4392,"Unless I got a different version of the device (possible, too),in real life the Halo device doesn't look sleek, nice and thin.It very close to the thickness of Fitbit device, I have, or like first round models of iPhone thickness, maybe.",3
4393,Doesn’t record steps correctly. All your videos do not help. Give me my money back.,1
4394,Won't even charge! How do I get my money back?,1
4395,"Not impressed, got the samsung watch 3 and I'm very impressed except for the battery.",1
4396,Would like to return.  Uncomfortable and not meeting my expectations.  Please assist.,1
4397,Did not like it,1
4398,"Not accurate, works intermittent. If all you want is your heart rate this is the device for you.",1
4399,My data was wiped with an active subscription.,1
4400,Was great for bit then kept unpairing. Till finally did not work at all anymore.,1
4401,Who designed this charger? Absolute garbage! How come this device can’t monitor temperature?,1
4402,"Didn’t work at all. Troubleshooting several times per instructions didn’t help, so I returned it.",1
4403,"Great product,but the battery sucks! It is literally 24 hours at a time",1
4404,Does not sync for initial set up.  Tried all troubleshooting. Don’t want this device,1
4405,Battery charging issues terrible hardware. Janky software,1
4406,"You can’t log food, it doesn’t track activity.  It’s worthless.",1
4407,not accurate compared to gps,1
4408,Dont charge i wish i did not  buy garbage,1
4409,"It just stop working, it’s the worst device from Amazon.  Not happy with it.",1
4410,I could never get this to sync with my iPhone.,1
4411,A real dud. Wore it for two weeks. Just get an Apple Watch.,1
4412,Garbage tracker,1
4413,Need to mesh it with the Apple Watch. It is kind of dull without basic functionality.,1
4414,"This product sucks. Essentially, it is trying to be an Apple watch with fewer features",1
4415,No se puede instalar APP di estas fuera de USA. Por ende no funciona.,1
4416,Not a fan. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the whoop. This does not suffice.,1
4417,No support.  No return policy.  Battery life on mine is zip.,1
4418,Product stops pairing to phone after recharging. Huge hassle to get it to pair again.,1
4419,Requires $4 monthly membership,1
4420,Inaccurate junk. Get a Garmin.,1
4421,It’s not silver it’s grey - I’ve already lost the charger,1
4422,Terrible product and customer service. Left me with a bruise and horrible skin irritation,1
4423,Stopped working after 9 months,1
4424,Nice try. Pairing difficulties constantly. We’re returning all of them. Solutions offered aren’t sufficient,1
4425,"Very much a beta device, had to return the first unit, second unit was even worse.",1
4426,"Broke, won’t reset",1
4427,Very uncomfortable to wear to bed. I couldn't find a good use for it,1
4428,Better off getting a fit bit,1
4429,This thing is junk....super inaccurate in all facets....don’t waste your money,1
4430,Always disconnects and literally doesn’t track. Terrible for workouts,1
4431,Band is no longer working and Amazon offers no support.,1
4432,Completely stopped charging and working. Waste of money.,1
4433,Useless pieces of junk. Nothing about it is accurate. Huge privacy concerns .,1

4435,Poor fitness tracker really bad battery life.,1
4436,Ended up buying a Fitbit.,1
4437,Mine was totally defective and did not work. Staying with Apple Watch.,1

4511,"I realized some things that could be improved on your watch. These are things I did not notice. Heart health is important especially to those with heart difficulties. An ECG would be invaluable. I also did not notice GPS. This would be invaluable as well because it could integrate with a mapping system app with mileage and climate app options to know the temp. and humidity plus details of altitude and course/direction, to locate missing children and adults, help fine tune health apps to fine tune with your body temp. and other stats, etc. GPS is also invaluable for those who would need a hard fall detection for outdoor activities that are extra strenuous and might result in an accident or an sos for the elderly possibly replacing life alert. A non invasive glucose monitoring system would benefit diabetics by way of a sweat sensor can also be beneficial in detecting a myriad of things and noninvasive like electrolyte levels to help flag dehydration and fatigue; blood sugar levels to track diabetes risk; or cortisol levels, which can influence emotional stress, metabolism, blood pressure and much more. The sweat detection can also be used to detect water table contents and the benefits you may need or the benefits in your water. NFC system would make the watch have an ease of use function that would create a more personal attention when dealing with cashiers and could just be swiped without looking. Since the watch already has quiet a few features a cultural hub app that works with the mic to translate and works with gps app on phone to help navigate you in a new city. A heating and cooling sensor that integrates with the mic, sweat sensor, heart monitor, air pollution, temperature body temperature, etc to work with elevated moods in order to calm or relax a person. Solar or passive energy recharging could help boost the battery life of the watch. Like the watch still clips in but the solar panel or passive panel is the clip on the watch so it just clips into its solar panel or passive panel like your watch already normally clips into its clasp. A vibration or chime setting for an emergency using gps to alert the user to an accident or natural disaster ahead using the phone to vibrate or chime. An app that creates a personalized folder for your doctor, therapist, etc a compilation of all the information on the apps right down to climate and mood with medication and over the counter rx. An app that can estimate the caloric intake and value of the food you eat by picture of the serving size with the serving you intake or of food already made and its intake value already listed. As well as a app that counts personal hygiene and medicine intake as well can be integrated into other health apps like heart health or a doctor's folder. Led lights to locate the watch in the dark. A detector that detects if you accidently wander to far from the watch in case you drop or leave it at a location. The watch could also be a smart key to by expanding the NFC to include virtual keys that could be used to swipe and still be virtually seamlessly innocuously inconspicuous. A virtual key app could become important for home, car, office, entering buildings, etc.I believe your watch is extremely invaluable in design and function. To me it is more practical then a smart watch with a screen. If marketed right you could put a foot hold on smart wear that could benefit a great many people. By incorporating some of these designs the market you could expand into is incalculably huge. I see this being used on large scales. For example as possible medical gear in foreign countries that may need the aid.",3
4512,Stopped working.,1
4513,Bad quality,1
4514,Poor support............,1
4515,I found the tracking of most activities to be inaccurate and the band where it attaches to the device is terrible. The little nubs are always detaching from the tracker until it did the final time when I was gardening- now never to be seen again unless it sprouts and grows,3
4516,"Wow where to even begin with this thing (it’s so bad).  First, simply put its very uncomfortable - needs to be fairly tight, sort of sticks to your arm etc. I only bought this to help monitor my sleep issues. The problem is 90% of the time it doesn’t work properly. It does a terrible job of tracking sleep after waking and going back to bed. It takes forever for sleep data to load and sometime it randomly changes adding or removing hours in bed. Many times it doesn’t even work at all so you wore this uncomfortable POS all night for no reason. The sync aspect of it to get the sleep data is very primitive and agin barely works. Just overall a terrible experience and so disappointing as it could be good if it worked right even half the time.",1
4517,It would never pick up when I was sleeping,2
4518,"I can't fully rate the Halo band, as I don't own one. And reading the reviews, probably not worth buying. It looks like a FitBit gone wrong. I have more features with my Redmi band. And I only spent $19.99.",1
4519,"I have been consistently using this for about 6 weeks now. After wearing this every day I am glad I go tit for the discounted price. As it functions currently I would not buy it for full price. First off I am disappointed by the size. I was hoping it would be a little less bulky and not feel as if I am wearing a watch; which is why I was okay with it not having a display. That being I said i would not want to wear this along side a watch and therefore I wish it would at least tell me the time. I have seen a lot of reviewers shaming others because the device specifically states that it has no display and people complain it has no display. Well guess what? You can ""think"" you want a device with no display and change your mind (as I did). That being said it is comfortable enough to wear a night for the sleep tracking and I forgot I was wearing it a few times and got in the shower (so thank goodness its water resistant).As for the functions:Tone: this sounded really interesting to me at first but I had privacy concerns (I'm a therapist so HIPPA and all that). I did turn it on for a few days and it basically told me what I already know. I am aware that as a therapist I may be more mindful of my tone on a daily basis. Others may find this feature more helpful.Sleep: I enjoy seeing how much time I spend in light sleep, deep sleep and REM. My biggest complaint about this feature is it is horribly inaccurate about tracking how long it took you to fall asleep. There were nights where I went to bed at 10:30pm and could not fall asleep until close to 1am; when I checked the app in the morning it would say 5 minutes to fall asleep. That's not even close. I can honestly say that any night it took me a long time to fall asleep was not tracked accurately; this was not a one time thing but something that happened consistently. There is also no way to edit this.Exercise/movement/points: I like how it will automatically starts tracking a workout after a certain amount of time has elapsed. Its cool to see the different amount of time spent in light, moderate and intense activity. That being said, again this is horribly inaccurate unless you are walking or running. The device will malfunction if you are gripping anything or your wrist is tense (weight lifting, planks, pushups, pullups, even holding bike handlebars tightly). It will log any activity time like this as light (no matter how much you are panting and sweating). Again my main complaint is not being able to edit this. I can delete the workout and enter it manually and have the activity logged all as one level (light, moderate, or intense) or leave it. The app does not let you edit how much time spent in light, moderate, or intense activity. So if i'm manually logging my work outs what is the point of the watch? And if you are manually logging exercise, each type is assigned a certain intensity level ex: HIIT - Intense, Weight lifting - Moderate, Yoga - LIGHT!!!! So again cannot edit this. So for 45 minutes of Yoga you will get 2 points. Very defeating and not motivating at all. This leads me to my last point.Sedentary time: Originally I was not bothered by this; I was getting enough movement that if I lost 3-4 points I didn't care. I do work a desk job and no i cannot spend much time getting up and walking around (again I'm a therapist so imagine meetings all day for 8 hours). I honestly did not pay much attention at all to this until the day I did Yoga. It felt awful to have done something good and strengthened my body only to earn 2 points and then have those points negated. I do think from a health standpoint it is important to understand how much time we spend sitting, but they could do this in other ways besides subtracting hard earned points.So for all the above reasons it gets 3 stars. I plan on continuing to use it as I have found it motivating to track my movement throughout the day. If they make updates to the app to fix some of the things I mentioned I would definitely rate it higher. I just seems to me what's the point of an activity tracker that does not accurately track you activity?",3
4520,"For the price, best fitness tracker without a screen. I wear mechanical watches and have a right wrist tattoo so I cover it with this band.",5
4521,"I love the ""faceless"" look of this device, as I still want to wear my beautiful analog watch.  This is subtle and unobtrusive yet i can see all my stats on my phone.",5
4522,"Needs nap option....messing up my sleep score and my activity points because I'm taking naps..it's counts the nap as sedintary time, OR.... vice versa - the time I'm awake in between morning wake up and nap time as ""time awake"" which ruins my sleep score ... I I'm doing 2qty 2 hour intense workouts along with 4-5 Miles of walking everyday, why is it giving me negative points for being sedintary time?? Punishing me cause I work 10 hours a day in front of my computer? They shouldn't give you ngtv points if you are super active doing intense workouts everyday.... I'm so close to hitting 1200 activity points goal, (1180) but keep getting screwed out cause of these stupid sedintary ngtv hour punishments. I understand giving zero points, but negtv points  ??",4
4523,This band is so much more accurate than my previous fitness tracker. I have not tested out the tone recognition but everything else is great. I will probably be willing to spend the monthly fee to keep all of the extras.,5
4524,"In November 2020, I received the Halo (at no cost to me) through my life insurance (John Hancock's Vitality program). I liked it; it worked, and it seems to be as accurate as my Apple watch but had the benefit of staying charged for days, so I could wear it while I slept and recharge it when I was in the shower. It didn't nag me like the Apple Watch does and it wasn't distracting. I pretty much didn't use any of the features (the tone analysis, the body composition (the photos composite it makes is really unflattering)), but I liked the simplicity of the tracking.My major complaint was that the charging clip is a terrible design and was finicky, but I managed to get it to work most of the time. In January 2021, the charging clip stopped working entirely and when I looked, the charging pins had bent. I called Amazon for a replacement (because it was still under warranty) and, after much effort, they gave name a $19.99 credit so I could buy a new charging clip for free.In July 2021, the clear plastic back of the device fell off. I was able to put it back on, but it continued to fall off and then, after a week or so, the Halo just stopped working. Maybe water or sweat got into the electronics, who know? I called Amazon about a warranty replacement. They had me send it back (with the new charging clip) and then would not provide me a replacement or a refund because it was ""paid for with a voucher"" (through my insurance company). I didn't really want a refund; I just wanted them to replace the defective device that I liked to use.They ultimately gave me a $65 credit (then subtracted the $19.99 they had already given me for the replacement charging clip which they now have) for a credit of $45 that can only be used to buy Amazon products. The representative on the phone said that this was a one-time deal, and they usually never give credits for items purchased with vouchers, implying I was lucky to get anything.A new Halo is $99, so if I want a new one, I need to spend $55. I imagine they have a whole warehouse of unsold Halos (they are not selling like hotcakes). I wish they could have just sent me a replacement for the defective one they originally sent me.Product Rating:Halo as a product: four stars; the charging clip is a terrible design.Halo’s long-term durability: zero stars (it fell apart in less than a year)Amazon’s attempt to make this right: Five stars for the customer service rep in January, one star for the customer service rep in August (he did try, but I think he could have escalated the call for a better resolution).Overall rating: meh.",2
4525,"My husband used this for 10 days and it stopped working. It won't charge, respond ... nothing. He liked it up until then.",2
4526,"This is simply a waste purchase. Have been using apple watch and after a week I felt like not wearing it anymore.For more insights, you need a subscription that doesn't make any sense. The battery is decent but the band could have been better.",1
4527,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Every time I try to pair the watch to my phone it blinks white 3 times and goes back to red. It had been charging for 6 hours but the light is still blinking red. I’ve tried everything but it just won’t turn back on. It used to work before but I don’t know what to do anymore.",2
4528,"Let me just say this…I tried really really hard to use this every day and be diligent and get into a healthy routine again, but the Bluetooth continually disconnects on me. I can’t get it to reconnect and I have to unpair and reinstall, spin around five times, stand on my head, and then maybe, just maybe, the pairing will stick for over 24 hours. I love all the features. I loved getting all my information. I felt like I was back on track with a decently healthy lifestyle for myself, but then I’d look at my tracker and it wouldn’t have saved any of my stuff because it hadn’t synced. It was really disheartening to lose all that data. I wanted to love this product so badly, but at last I have buyers remorse. I guess I’ll just wait for the new Apple Watch like my husband keeps telling me and then go with another apple product, which is not what I really wanted to do. I shall close this review with this….if you want to know more about your body it’s perfect, but if you want consistent data to help you improve yourself don’t hold your breath.",1
4529,"This Halo can be a great product.  Currently, I have more wearables than perhaps anyone:  Whoop, Oura, Garmin Enduro and Scosche.  Also I use Emfit.  The Halo was a great addition, until it wasn't because of its sleep tracking problems.  These problems would be so simple for Amazon to fix.  The problem is that the device might make a mistake in when woke up and that mistake might be hours off.  Most devices allow you to change the time by sliding to a different time.  Amazon TRIES to do this, but fails because the slider doesn't allow you to change to any time.  So what happens is that Amazon might say you woke up at 4.00 a.m. and Amazon WILL permit you to change that but only to a time BEFORE 4.00 a.m.  So if you woke up at 8.00 a.m., Amazon's Halo will not allow you to change so that your sleep metrics can be recalculated.  Therefore, if you buy this device, expect to virtually NEVER get accurate sleep tracking.  And realize that Amazon -- clearly the best company in the world -- could fix this in about five minutes but Amazon hasn't done it yet.  Once they fix this, I will put the Halo back on because otherwise the device rocks and gives metrics that Oura and Whoop can't give.  But with its guarantee of inaccurate sleep tracking, I have taken off the device and am waiting for Amazon to fix it.",3
4530,"I did all the steps it told me to. I reset it till it was purple. Took it out of the charger, put it back in and waited till it blinks white. The select an accessory screen comes up but is blank. Why is it not showing up. It’s not paired to my iPhone in Bluetooth",1
4531,"This tracker lasted for about a year and then bit the dust very unexpectedly.  But with that aside, I lost about 13 pounds using this device, purchasing a fitness program by Janine Murray, cleaning up my eating habits, and I had a lot of motivation from my breakup to have a glow-up. I did gain 7 pounds back because I have emotional eating issues. But am just happy that I am not the weight that I used to be.  I also got really honest with myself when tracking calories, so I love to see how many calories I burn in a day so that I can always make sure I'm in a calorie deficit.  I'm not too sure about the body composition scan, which is the main reason why I purchased the tracker, I'm just not sure if it's entirely correct.  I wouldn't know though how to identify accuracy in this area, though.  I don't do the challenges as much as I'd like, I forget about them.  I wish there was another way to entice me to go to that section of the app.  I also wish they would make the video available on a website, so that I could hook my laptop up to my tv, I never exercise to workout videos on a phone",4
4532,"nice idea poorly executed. doesn't maintain synch. have to keep doing factory resets (which purges all data) lather than 1 night, i have no archive of data because the tech is so bad. if you enjoy continuously fiddling with electronic devices with no benefit, this is your gadget.

4534,"Dislike. Constantly needs recharging. No visible information. Must be synced with smartphone to read. Save yourself and buy a known quantity like a Fitbit. This is a piece of crap! Sorry Jeff Bezos, but it is. Really deserves NO stars.",1
4535,"What your goals are will determine how well this will benefit you.The tl;dr is that if you work out 4-5 days a week, are in athletic condition, and/ or want something that's an alternative to Fitbit then look somewhere else as this isn't going to be what you want - especially if you're a cyclist.If you are just getting back into a workout routine due to covid or are looking for something that's primarily for health management and want something with some interesting health care features then this is could be what your looking for. Those over 65 will probably see more use for this though. Try to get it on sale.I received mine as part of the early access back in 10/2020. I think I wore it for 3 months before stopping use. Here's the deal, it primarily uses your heart beat to measure calorie burn and activity score - which is fine- but it also runs the heart beat measurement against the motion measured with the pedometer in the device and this runs into several issues:First it seems to not be able to calculate cycling well. There were times where I would do 45min -1hr long cycling session and it would either count it has mild activity or not at all even if I was drenched in sweat - which I found was due to not moving my arm. It's very hard cycling while swinging one arm and I didn't try strapping it to my leg has I figured it wouldn't calculate heart rate very well. Same goes for weight lifting. My weight lifting started to become a cross-fit routine just so it would register and those numbers would make me feel better about myself.Which is another problem I have with this - you become obsessed with the score system. Mine was on average in the mid 500-600 score with the weekly goal of 300. However your score is calculated as physical activity minus sedentary time = score. Your sedentary time starts immediately when it has decided that you're awake. So if you decide that your gonna lay in the bed early morning for an extra 30 or you don't workout until after your 8 hour office job then your gonna get hit irregardless. While touching on the topic it's pretty good at sleep measurement, I guess. It's also hard to know the complete accuracy as you're asleep...Now onto the app features. Understand that my use was with it's day one features and not what has been added, but I will discuss it's newer features.It keeps up with your daily calorie burn and activity levels as said before. It also offers workout videos which have recently added the feature to cast to a tv, something I didn't have the option for back when. Back in late 2020, early 2021, if I wanted to use one of the videos I had to prop my phone somewhere that would not be in the way and could also see. The annoyance factor caused me to not bother. Otherwise the videos were good in themselves and an appreciated feature. It also has the option to connect to other services, a grand total of 2 which hasn't changed since I used it: weight watchers and John Hancock, which I think is life insurance. It does record your activity level and aggregates your score for the current day/ daily, weekly, and monthly, however there is not a calendar feature so if want to revisit a good workout from 3 weeks ago and either compare your daily score or recreate it you'll have to scroll back each day for three weeks. There is no other option.Speaking of limited options it still only records weight lifting under one broad activity level of ""weight lifting"" with no way for it to record routines, rep count, or weight amount. MyFitnessPal has that feature and it's free and connects to other services... So I'm not sure what Amazon is waiting on.As to my knowledge the app still does not have a caloric counter or a nutrient counter to display. Everything caloric/ nutrition measurement is a weekly program where you start the program for a number of weeks and can set reminders for logging responses. However, responses are not recording the actual food eaten or amount, just simple yes or no answers. I sat here, while typing, going through different programs and all were yes/ no. Even the program ""measuring a meal to better understand amounts"" recorded your progress as yes/no... Amazon is the biggest supply chain distributor in the world but they can't add a basic math caloric counter....The last two main attractions are the biometric scan and tone feature. I feel like the tone feature works very well and fairly accurate. However I work in hospital administration and constantly have to speak professionally so my tone score was often neatrul and having halo during the initial days of quarantine didn't lead to me using the feature a lot.The biometric scanner feature worked ok, I discontinued the subscription so I lost access to the feature. Essentially it compares your body size and height against your weight and the average and calculates a score. I think it could be very accurate. I am overweight, 230lbs, but I also weight lift so I question it's complete accuracy... But I also don't need Amazon to tell me I'm overweight as I have a mirror.Also, it does give a warning before first use that if you have body dysmorphic disorder then to either consult your doctor/ therapist or refrain from using.All in all I say it's a decent first attempt by Amazon, but if it's not on sale the don't bother.",3
4536,It would have been nice if I were told how to use the product,1
4537,"I wanted this for 2 reasons, the voice analysis and the sleep tracker. I wore it on my right arm and Apple Watch on my left. Double banded up and ready to go, I had high hopes. Still needed the time and I wanted to see how Apple compares. I work in the medical field in the craziness right now. I’m in and out of PPE every 10 min or so.I noticed the Halo felt like it held onto moisture a little more. I kept finding myself drying it and trying to reposition. It was the same when I did workouts.With the voice analysis on, it used ALOT of battery.It would tell me I was happy (when I was singing music in the car) then at work it would be  between annoyed and neutral. No kidding.After a few weeks of being underwhelmed by my lack of points, boring tone and constant lack of sleep, I found it annoying. I returned it.Pros- looks like a ponytail holder on your wrist- tracks sleep and toneCons-doesn’t give a lot of points for workouts-the charger is odd. I thought it was charging a few times but I missed the little groove it needed to sit in-rubbed weird on my arm-holds moistureI would keep shopping.",3
4538,"I returned this item after about a week of using it. It's not what I was really looking for in a tracker for the price, and the added monthly subscription. I did get this while it was offered at a lower price, and feel the retail price is too much for what you get compared to other trackers.I did like the sleep features, but found it highly uncomfortable to wear while sleeping. It feels bulky, and I tend to sleep with my arms under my pillow, which made wearing the band even more uncomfortable. I did have to loosen it quite a bit to sleep with it, so hopefully my sleep numbers were actually correct.I did like that it measures the intensity of workouts and the BMI tracking, no matter how awkward it was. I feel like without the added subscription, the band would be pretty basic, but the added subscription doesn't offer that much for me. I tried some of the programs, but was hoping for more from them. It just felt like advertisement to sign up and pay more money for things.I did think the band looked nice, and liked that it didn't have a screen. I've only ever had Jawbone trackers, and did like them. I'd love a combination of the Jawbone and Halo bands, and wouldn't mind paying a bit more for something like that.",2
4539,"I like the look.  I got it on sale for $49, so I like the price.  Now for the bad.  One day when I wore it all day it logged no steps for me. I reset the device and it seemed to fix it.  I've worn it on my treadmill, while also wearing a chest strap heart rate monitor, and it is off by around 25 bpm.  Maybe the chest strap is off, I guess, but I would be more inclined to believe the Halo is off.  The sleep data is great if you choose to believe it.  I wear it every night to sleep and it seems like it is off around half the time.  I remember waking up at times to use the bathroom and the Halo doesn't log it. And finally, I followed all of the instructions, tightened the band, held at chest, and checked my blood oxygen levels 5 times in a row. The results: 93, 91, 83, 85, 94.  I don't have any confidence whatsoever in that function. So, my opinion is that this presents you data and has a nice app, but the data isn't accurate for a lot of the time, so then, what is the point?",2
4540,"Not great for me. The charge had trouble staying was a big problem. I couldn't even make a full day. The voice /emotion tracker didn't give you enough information so I knew why I was ""excited"" or ""angry"". Honestly I think it caught my TV or something some times because I know I didn't talk to anyone at those times.And honestly the lack of screen that I thought was a bonus was a big de motivater for me. I walked about about 2000 less steps a day when I used it compared to my fitbit or even just phone tracker. Seeing that I was ALMOST at X amount of steps or distance helps me more than I realized. Not the worst product but needs some fine tuning. I did end up returning it.",3
4541,"I was super excited to try this out a couple years back when it first launched and even signed up to get an early access which gave me a bit of discount. I actively used it through their free trial then couldn't even find the option to discontinue the membership so left it alone. This one did not even last a year. When I tried to use it again it stopped charging. I contacted Amazon rep to get a replacement charger but was told it was not available - that I had to order a NEW halo band/charger, but since the band was less than a year old, they'd refund the money. So I ordered a new one, paid FULL price of $100 this time, which was no fault of mine, expecting to get a refund. Amazon only gave me a partial refund charging me for a re-stocking fee type of a thing, so I basically paid about $140 for the replacement one. I still wanted to give it a good chance and started using it again but shortly after I realized that comparing to the Apple Health App, the halo is grossly faulty with their step tracking. I knew that there was no way I walked over 4 miles in one day - I walked LESS THAN ONE mile. This is just a very small example of how inaccurate their data is. Do not trust the data and go based on the halo app. I got a much cheaper FitBit which is so much more accurate and easy to use; I thought halo seemed intrusively and overly shoving their other apps to my face. Will never buy again and would advise others to not waste their money. Why do you think it's always on sale??",1
4542,"For years, I resisted getting the Apple Watch. I hated the design, I still do. It is a miniature iPhone or iPad strapped onto your wrist. Then it started collecting data. And more data. The reason for my purchase was this app Noom that I am trying. I was skeptical, but after sticking with the approach 'its-okay, eating half a tub of ice cream is not the end of the world. It's most likely not 3400 calories, so you won't gain 1 lb for that.' The point is, it has empathy. Feeling better at a more human level.  That is where Amazon's device fails miserably.Amazon's gadget collects a whole lot of data, including the tone of your voice. Like this GQ reviewer says, ""when I lost $12 in a Zoom poker hand and reflexively dropped an f-bomb in front of a handful of longtime friends, Amazon Halo’s voice analyzer told me I sounded “angry, astonished, or disgusted.” When I lazed in bed all morning and at one point sang along to Roxy Music’s “Mother of Pearl,” Amazon Halo took back some of my precious points and then informed me that I was coming across as “opinionated” (though that might be more of a commentary on Bryan Ferry). When, as an experiment, I read my Halo a local news report in the fake-happy cadence of a TV anchor, it was happy and told me I sounded energetic and authoritative. ""In Machine Learning, we often combine various metrics that can tell how the system is performing into one combined metric. Why? It is easier for humans to understand. It works in many cases too. Mostly because these systems are solving problems that are mostly technical; the more it veers toward deciphering human eccentricities, it gets rougher. My mother and I talk loudly. It's a family trait. Most, including my white husband who did not understand Bengali or the quintessential Bengali traits (initially), though we were arguing. But my mother and I love our conversations and we do not intend to change it for the precious 150 points.  No, Amazon. Thank you.",1
4543,"Have used this now for several months. The biggest issues I have are with the sleep tracking and the fact that it does not link to other services. My health insurance uses Real Appeal/Rally Coach to help track ""fitness"" to keep insurance costs lower. This does not integrate with anything so steps and sleep and heart rate are not linked for credit. Pretty frustrating considering the Samsung fit watches and fit bit that I have had in the past could link to several different apps. The sleep tracking never notices when I get up at night and can he up walking around d for several minutes and it doesn't acknowledge it.",3
4544,"I keep having this issue with the Halo not syncing - especially the morning after I've been sleeping. Sometimes it takes unsyncing-resyncing multiple times and putting it on the charger to for it to finally ""take"". This gives me pause as to the accuracy of the sleep tracking and anything else.I moved from a basic FitBit Alta HR hoping that it might be a bit of an upgrade.  The voice and weight management tool is fine but unnecessary. But, the one thing I miss is any sort of physical notice to get up and move - even if it was a notice from my phone.",3
4545,"UPDATED 7/15/21 FROM MY REVIEW ON 7/13:  Customer Service contacted me after I posted my review.  They addressed my concerns and gave me credit so I can purchase a new one.  I'm hoping it will last longer this time, I really did enjoy it and feel weird without it on.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I loved my Amazon Halo at first!  It motivated me to get more activity points.  I used it for 9 months but then the plastic piece on the back broke off and it irritated my skin without it.  I contacted Amazon Customer Service who confirmed it was under warranty and they gave me instructions to ship it back, which I did.  They said they would ship me a new one, that order was never received.  Then I contacted them again and they said they would refund me, that was never received.  Every time I have to chat with Customer Service, I have to explain all over again...so useless...I give up.  Don't waste your money to only use this for a few months.  My other pet peeve was that the app would always crash (even after updating.)",4
4546,I thought the Halo would add to  my smart watch. All it did differently was use voice recognition to determine how I was speaking to people. Not anything I needed. I ended up with my watch on one arm and the halo on my other arm.,3
4547,"I bought the Halo around the first of the year. Had it for 3 weeks, the watch face broke where the band connects to the watch. They allowed me to return it and sent another one. 3 months later, exact same problem. The watch face broke where the watch hinges to the band. The Halo itself is not bad; I like the app though it has a few user-friendly issues and is not easy to navigate. The watch itself is not that easy to navigate either.",1
4548,"People who complain about this product are entitled to do so. If you're one of the people crying because others don't share your views, get over yourself. I see and understand where both sides are coming from. I personally wouldn't be dumb enough to spend 100 on a rubber bracelet that doesn't change anything about you or your life. If it told the time of day, then it might be useful...oh wait, every smart watch on earth does that? And I would have same data as this device does and no monthly subscription? Brilliant!",3

I would like the features and no screen, but it could do much more.  the only data you can get live is HR.  no BP, no Sp02 range,  the tone feature says i am angry and annoyed all of the time, plus it drains the battery. I ordered the Rose gold version, and it turned black after 2 days.  Amazon's great CS replaced and the replacement was also black when it arrived!the sleep tracking is very accurate and the ""account linking"" they offer are not compatible with except WW and  John Hancock Vitality. i rec'd this item at the lower invite price, but i am not sure it is worth it.

4551,"The Amazon Halo needs a significant amount of development before it is ready for launch. Between the limiting user interface and lack of quality features, Amazon should expect a major wave of product returns in the coming weeks. As an early-access user, I could write a novel on the underwhelming features and shortcomings of this product. However, for now I would advise potential customers to STAY AWAY from this product until significant developments roll out.This technology is years behind its competitors (Apple, Fitbit) and will most likely flop without a major overhaul. The tone analysis is useless and relies more on analyzing your speech/words than your tone itself. The body analysis essentially just stores photos of you in your underwear with no real useful features. The sleep tracker is really the only Halo feature that has any value at the moment, and even that can be replicated with a free Sleep Tracker phone app. The bulky, rigid device and uncomfortable band outweigh even the miniscule benefits gained from using this product.  Unless Amazon announces some groundbreaking new features in the coming weeks, I will likely pursue a refund for this uncharacteristically disappointing product.Message for Amazon's Product Development team: If you're going to use early-access customers as beta testers for your first generation products, make sure you actually reach out to them for feedback before launching the product to the public. Reviews were disabled during the early-access period and we were unable to provide valuable feedback that could have saved Amazon some embarrassment. This product is far from ready for a public launch and is the result of an overly-eager project manager more focused on hitting deadlines for Jeff Bezos than creating a quality product for consumers.",1
4552,I like the Halo a lot. What got me was there was no screen. I wanted something that I could see my steps or heart rate without logging into my phone. I loved knowing how I sounded when I was talking to my friend or family. I loved the body scan too to track my progress.,3
4553,"Updated review: I love it, but I have to give up wearing it because it’s giving me insane reactions and even bruises. I’be tried loosening it, moving it to different places on my arm, taking it off for hours at a time, switching arms, cleaning the back, nothing works. Wherever the metal touches my skin I get a reaction. I don’t have sensitive skin and haven’t had issues with jewelry or anything so this is so disappointing.My initial review:I measured my wrist and ordered a medium as per the size chart. I have crazy small wrists so I was surprised that my measurement was medium. Now I have it as cinched as I can get it, but the Velcro only extends so far so a lot of the band sticks out and gets caught on things. Be wary of the size guide.",2
4554,I was coming from using Fitbit and was hoping for a comparable or better tracker. I missed the reminders and alerts that I was not receiving and it didn’t connect with many of my apps.. I would have thought that Amazon would come out with a winner but it was a fail for me.,3
4555,"I like the sleep evaluation. The voice evaluation for tone fluctuates so much that I'm not sure what to make of it. I mainly use my iWatch to assess my exercise and the halo battery does not last long if you evaluate your tone. Also, sometimes tone works and sometimes it doesn't",3

4557,I ordered the medium after checking what size I needed.  It came but the dimensions are what would fit a child.  I'm afraid to order a larger size because I'm afraid the dimensions would be like a child's size or it will be too big.  Not sure.,3
4558,"I was curious about the tone of voice feature, so I gave Halo a try. After testing it for about a month, I noticed that, just like Alexa, it has not been tested on women. How does one know if one sounds restraint or aggressive or affectionate? It's when you compare the tone of voice to another tone of voice, that you set as a benchmark, and then go from there. So that benchmark must be a white male model (Jeff B.?) because the Halo interpretations are similar to the remarks of men when they hear a woman talk: SHY, AFFECTIONATE, RESTRAINED, EMOTIONAL in one word. This is so subtle that you start believing it for a second.But no, thank you, have back your HALO band and do it like you live in 2021 and not 1883.",2
4559,"It was everything when I first received it, I was so motivated and excited, then later it just continued to disconnect and it was so frustrating while working out when I looked to check my progress ....there was nothing recorded so I sent it back sorry",3
4560,"The data measured is far too rudimentary for me to bother charging it every day. Step count? My phone already does that. Sleep quality? There's an app for that that is far more useful. Where I thought the product would shine is through integration with other apps like Headspace, but there's no actual integration with the apps. It just adds a limited library of other services to the Halo app. It would be nice if I could use the data tracked to improve my life in some way, such as an alarm to wake me during my lightest sleep cycle. There's a ton of room for improvement, but I'm not at all looking forward to the day my 6-month trial wears out and I'm asked to pay for features that should have been released since Day 1.",2
4561,Did not care for the sleep tracking did not track sometimes and very uncomfortable to wear while sleeping. Wish the Halo had a display screen also to check step progress.,3
4562,"Got this from the preorder.  At first glance everything was great.  Very minimalist, easy app connection, comfortable to wear, but as I used it I discovered the step count was way off (always high) compared to my phone & current activity tracker.  Since steps are what I mostly monitor I returned it and stuck with my Misfit/Phone.The sleep monitor pretty much matched my Misfit so I think that was fairly accurate.I used the body fat feature once.  Told me I was 24%.  My scale (which I realize is not very accurate) says 9%.  I'm 5-9 144 lbs and fit.  No way I'm 24% body fat so I'm calling BS on that feature.",2
4563,The smartwatch is missing so many features its unbelievable... Calls are not coming in so you can either decline if you can't accept. You cannot control the music like playing on spotify. You can't share the data on Strava. You can't see distance in kilometers and miles... its missing all of these features and more. Would be really nice if they added these features.,2
4564,When reading instructions for set up it said I needed an iPhone 12.  I have an 11. So I returned. But I was really looking forward to it.,3
4565,I wish for a display screen. I understand the clean looks and under the radar design. I don’t own one. Just my two cents and feedback.,3
4566,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife (just 6 months ago). For the first few months it was great, but for the last couple it has been consistently tracking erratically. The Halo app utilizes a point system and on the same 30 min cardio routine it will register anywhere from 2 points to 20. Point-less. Ha. And now it’s apparently already out of warranty as well. Meanwhile around the same time I purchased an off brand tracker at about half the price that’s still ticking like a champ and has a digital clock display as well. I guess I’ll be doling out for a second one of those.",2
4567,If you work nights it doesn’t track your sleep,3
4568,"On paper, a great idea. In reality, poorly executed.Being that this device has no screen time, you'd figure it last a few days on a charge, not the case here. It lasts maybe 1.5 days before it dies. That is really bad in my opinion. It doesn't even show the time in led circles, so seriously low battery life.Also the device pretty much reports only sad feelings when it's not the case. .So while I bought mine for my wife and she will still use it for now, will not be buying a second for myself.",2
4569,"Resting heart rate appears to be a random number. The only time my heart rate is anywhere near what the app lists as my resting HR is when I've been asleep. Notice Halo states, ""Halo determines your resting heart rate during inactive moments outside of sleep..."". The app is easy enough to use and contains plenty of information. The connection to the app takes a while. It's not the worst connection, but most certainly not the best either.Sleep tracking seems to be mostly accurate, though I have had nights when I have fully woken up and moved around and Halo did not register this. Most nights it seems accurate. I love the idea, and it's not horrible, but Halo definitely needs work. I have used this for quite a while before writing a review and my final decision is that I would not recommend this item to anyone. My purpose for purchasing and using this is essentially useless when it is not tracking my heart rate properly. I'll probably move on to a different, more reputable, brand for my needs.",1
4570,It’s decent for the price. And the basic features you don’t have to pay for would make it enough for me ti be satisfied but the body scan feature is a good idea and I genuinely can’t wait for Amazon to perfect it to a t.,4
4571,"1)The charging base does not work consistently.2) When charged the unit does not always measure a nights sleep.3) Battery does not last a long as the claims are (that is taking into account using and not using all the features).4) Amazon says support for my product has already ended so who do I turn to for help? No one.Thanks amazon, now I will enjoy my Fitbit instead because they are not abandoning me.",2
4572,"I am really frustrated/ disgusted. I enjoyed my halo so much. But the last couple months it was telling me I wasn't sleeping or was only sleeping 2-3 hrs a night. I thought it may just need a reset. I followed directions, tried everything. The app authentication code does not get to me, not email not sms text, so I cannot use the app and thus cannot use the halo. There is no option to get customer service to help get it set up. It is less than a year old. I guess you get what you pay for. I don't even want to spend the money to replace it and I've spent hours of my life that I won't get back struggling with it. They got their money so it is all good, right? I see I am not the only one with a short timer useless dud. I guess they want me to buy a new one. I miss it, but no way. A simple factory reset has been so effortful and has failed. Don't bother.",1
4573,"I really enjoyed having this project while it worked. The sleep tracking was interesting but definitely not completely accurate. I received it a little over a month ago and it is no longer working. One morning when I woke up, I looked on the app and it said I wasn't connected. I clicked on the band and nothing happened. I've tried letting it sit, I've tried charging it but it will not turn on.",2
4574,"Got the Halo for Christmas and so far things have been great!The Halo is exactly what it's advertised as; a multi-function wellness companion.There is no screen and therefore no distractions!  You're not forever checking to see if you're getting steps in or how long is this workout, or even what time it is.  There is no annoying ""wake-up"" light that comes on when you accidentally move your arm at night, either.It's a wellness companion, not a smart watch!  So don't expect it to have all the functions of a watch!Yes, the Halo tracks your sleep, activity level and even your mood via the Tone tracker.  The Body section while yes it can track your Body Fat %, it's completely OPTIONAL.I love that the app has so many labs that you can explore!  The bed-time meditations have been awesome for helping me get to sleep.  I've also tried the ASMR Mood Improvement meditation which was pretty cool too!My only criticism for the Halo is the battery life.  I have the tone analyzer set to ""More Tone"".  To be fair, Amazon tells you up front that the average battery life is 1 day when in that mode, and I have found that to be true.  Usually, I would charge my devices overnight, but in order to take advantage of the sleep tracker, that's not an option for the Halo.  I end up having to charge in the morning at the office.  It would be awesome if the battery life lasted for a few days.  Maybe on the next generation :) In the meantime, an additional charging clip as an accessory or the option to get two in the box would be a good compromise :)",5
4575,"I purchased a Halo for my wife in December of last year at a local Amazon 4-star store. The little black chip like cover on the back that protects the mechanism keeps falling off. I went to the store and the guy working there said, ""what's a Halo?"" I called customer service and they can't track it because I didn't buy it through my account on-line. I no longer have the receipt so the customer service rep blew me off. Little do they know that my wife purchases as an Amazon Prime member every week and I purchase at least once a month. They really don't care. This is what happens when a company gets too big. Needless to say, we will both be cancelling our accounts. We spent maybe just under 10 thousand dollars last year with Amazon. A small bit of nothing for them but it's the principle. There are other options and we'll gladly take them. Also, we have many friends and business associates that we will be informing regarding this issue. Horrific customer service!!!",1
4576,"Unfortunately, Halo didn't last two weeks. At first I tried it and found that the records were inconsistent. The first half-hour walk was recorded at 12 points, and the other similar walk only counted for 1 point the next day. One morning activity accumulated 15 points, and the record disappeared after I took a nap. The important indicator of Halo is the accumulation of 150 points in a week's activities. If the record is inconsistent, the effect will be greatly reduced. I tried it on my wife the next week. She was small and her step count was a reasonable increase of ten to twenty percent. But when I walked one thousand steps, her counts were eight thousand steps. The most deadly battery has a problem, it suppose to last for a week when it is fully charged. The wife can only last one day when wearing it. In short, this Halo obviously has a hardware or software problem. I don’t know if it was launched in a hurry because of the shopping boom at the end of last year. The price is $99.  is one-third cheaper than the popular Fitbit, but obviously not worth it. I have returned the product.",1
4577,"I found this device disappointing. The lack of even a minimal display limits its usefulness. Battery life at just over one day with voice monitor feature on is unacceptable. This device seems to be mostly a portal for 3rd party paid fitness apps to get their hooks into your wallet, and for Amazon to mine personal info. I returned the device and got Fitbit Charge 4.",2
4578,"There really is no reason to purchase this product for this price. The whole argument that the no screen keeps you away from distractions is absolute bs. If it was 20 30 bucks then it would make sense. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars because it works for the features it says it provides, but the price is not worth it.",2
4579,Not that impressed with this tracker. My band constantly need to by synced and the heart rate rarely work. It never tracks my sleep correctly. If I wake up to use the bathroom it thinks I’m awake for the rest of the time. I’m going back to my fitbit. Tracks everything with no problem and no membership required!,2
4580,"This tracker is simply too much trouble.  When it ""works"", it seems okay, but I've had to ""forget this device"" and try to set it up more times than I can keep track of, and I'm just DONE.  Too late to return it, so it's just getting tossed.  What a waste!",2
4581,"As someone who loves data, this device delivers insights that any beginner to intermediate fitness person can appreciate, at a substantially lower cost overall than the competition (e.g., WHOOP). While both products are still in development, I give the Halo a slight edge primarily due to the cost.The Halo offers great tracking insights for sleep and voice, as well as built-in training 'labs' that are great workouts and accountability trials. Unless you are a professional athlete or fitness trainer, I see little reason to look beyond the Halo.",4
4582,I tried to last with this but couldn't. The band was terribly uncomfortable and so was the Halo itself.The app has great tracking but that couldn't make up for the fact that it was a terrible designI would advise that you wait until version 3.,2
4583,"The sleeper taker works great, I really liked that you can see how your temperature may change each night.  The mobile app is easy to use and and understand. The band itself is extremely light and you barely can tell it is on.  The band is fabric and a downside is that if you shower with the band it does take a while dry and you need to ensure you really wash it cause the fabric tends to have an odor.",4
4584,"Bought this as a gift for my husband. He loved it and was using it regularly until the membership trial expired. We tried to purchase the membership, but because I gifted it and he linked it to his information apparently the halo has become useless. We contacted Amazon support from my account and from his account numerous times (each time being told something different) and it has gone nowhere. Amazon support is usually super helpful but this was pointless. Extremely frustrating and silly - we will take our money elsewhere since Amazon doesn’t want it.",1
4585,"Please make this in an ankle or clip version. I work in food prep, and the food code prohibits anything on your wrist. Food service isn't the only job with these types of policies or safety concerns either.",2
4586,"The watch eventually stopped working and I wasn’t able to sync it back to my phone again.  Waste of money, I wish I had picked up a Fitbit. The sleep tracking was good but that’s about it.",2
4587,The unit I received would not last even 24 hours even with mic disabled.  Returned unit with battery issue.  Sleep tracking did not seem as accurate as other bands.,2
4588,"I can't think of another fitness tracker that hides so many of its features behind a paywall. What you get is an expensive device that you never fully own and that doesn't even have a screen. Horrible concept, go get a FitBit or a Garmin and save yourself some time, money, and frustration.",1
4589,"Don't waist your time and money, the worst fit I've ever got. Poor cheap quality.  Delivered to me in an open box, smashed packaging (envelope!). I am now trying to return it and their customer service just gazlighting me...... Amazon, what is going on with you? No good old customer oriented service anymore..... upset....",1
4590,"It told me I didn't sleep one night, it told me I was sleeping when I wasn't, and it overall lacked any use.",2
4591,For an AMAZON branded product it took a ridiculous amount of time to be delivered  The product itself is fine,2
4592,Really like the sleep tracking not always spot on but think it’s the way I sleep. Like the amount of time the battery stays charged. Don’t use the voice recognition doesn’t seem necessary. It’s seems to count steps higher than my Apple Watch but I guess that’s relatively not that big of a deal.,4
4593,The band made an irritation on my wrist other than that it is a good product,2
4594,Cool product.  But having to charge the battery every 24-48 hours is excessive.,2
4595,"I don’t like having an Amazon device that’s attached to my body 24/7. They already collect enough data through the apps. Don’t give them access to clear detailed photos of yourself, allow them to track your sleep and daily habits. This is a disgusting waste of money for a product that can’t even tell you the time. It gets worse, when you inevitably lose interest in the app and leave the device in a drawer or misplace the custom charger, you’ll forget about it. Then bam 5 months later  You will get charged 3.99 for something you can’t even remember what it was for.",1
4596,"What a piece of garbage, went to download the app and it says it only works with IOS 13.  Sorry, my iPhone won't upgrade to 13 since it's a very functional iPhone 6.  Not about to spend another thousand for a different iPhone to get this to work. P.O.S.  Buyer beware.",1
4597,Just a gimmick fitness watch...same on amazon,2
4598,"save your health. do NOT buy this or other devices that bring RF/wifi into your bedroom. the evidence is strong against whatever ""benefits"" it may offer. don't join me (ahead of the curve due to decades living in the middle of SF) in being debilitated by the lure of wireless devices. not worth it!",1
4599,"I bought the band last December when it first came out. I love the idea of a band with no screen that can compliment my normal watch or samsung smart watch. I returned it that same month due to the battery just dying and unable to charge. It only last a month. I would like to buy this again, but not sure if Amazon fixed the battery issue. I loved the different features, of the watch. I am hoping they keep a screen less version of the halo band just with a better battery situation.",1
4600,"Inaccurate sleep tracking!!! Purchased as a gift formy husband. He consistently received between 0-40 as sleep scores for months. Went to doctor and requested sleep study, had sleep study and was told all was ok. As device instructions suggest, we did factory reset of device serveral times, confirmed band not too tight or lose, etc. Still inaccurate. We do not advise purchasing this product as the sleep tracking appears to be defective. We purchased a different tracker from another company and it works great.",1
4601,"very uncomfortable and doesnt do much, scam for your money.",1
4602,Purchase product for my father for Father's Day set it up for him allowed him to use it you were excited about the opportunity to track steps sleep and tone what a waste of time the product does not work it's built poorly and has broken trying to move him off the Fitbit to this was a big mistake save yourself the time don't invest a dollar or a moment of your time in this poorly created technology,1
4603,"Since all off the useful features are subscription based, they should sell the Halo at cost (less than $25) or, better yet, give it away with a two-year subscription. Not to mention, the subscription is way over-priced if you have to pay for the Halo first. Of course, the hook is that you've sunk $100 into a device that is mostly useless without the app, making not buying the app seem like the right choice. Amazon marketing at it's best!",1
4604,"This band is collecting all sorts of data about you. Sleep cycles, body composition, steps, heart rate, what muscles you’re using, ext. I feel like we are moving towards a dystopia with all this unnecessary tech. Amazon is going to have access to all this data, nothing about this is private. If you want to get healthy just go for a run or join a gym and seek a personal trainer for motivation. You don’t need this gadget.",1
4605,"I have tried this alongside an Apple Watch and more importantly a Whoop. I LOVED the Whoop and so badly wanted this to be my ""cheap"" alternative. Unfortunately it just doesn't even come close. The sleep tracking is so-so, but didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know. The app was decent, but I just don't have an interest in the 3D imaging. I'd rather the device tell me something about my body's performance. I can guage my physical appearance with a mirror on my own. This is no different/better than a fitbit in my opinion. Save yourself the money.",1
4606,"I was tempted to get one since I wouldn't mind a simple sleep and health tracker. I then noticed that all too common 'MONTHLY FEE"". If the membership was included with Amazon Prime I would probably get one over any other tracker. This tracker provides the same thing EVERY tracker provides, but no screen. They say having no screen is a ""feature"". I would like to have a basic clock or ability to check stats without my phone.",1
4607,the body scan function didnt work,4
4608,"I want to love this watch so badly but can't. Its comparable to a Whoop but the price is more attractive. The tracking is horrendous. The first day I could not get it to do anything although it was synced. I finally got it working after re- set up twice. The first day it worked it ""ghosted"" my activity for 5 hours in the middle of the day. Then that night it missed most of my sleeping. Its frustratingly inaccurate on tracking so I will most likely be mailing back because its also uncomfortable to wear.",1
4609,"I've gone through the install app steps, charged the device and worn it for two days and can not even get this thing started...I cannot find it on my iPhone to search for starting procedures/you don't provide a help number/nor can I find anything related to actually using the thing...Only promotional ""stuff"" about all the magical things it's suppose to do.  I saved the original carton so if you can't help me learn how to use it at least send instructions for returning it and a refund.Respectfully,D. L. Hudiburgh (by the way, I'm 82)",1
4610,Halo band is totally worth it. Holds charge many days. Sleep tracking is excellent. Activity tracking is very good! This is a winner most importantly because it doesn’t have a screen. You can wear ur Apple Watch on the other hand and do all tracking via halo ‘coz Apple sucks!,5
4611,"It linked to my iPhone for one day. Disconnected itself. Now no matter what I do, even following the instructions to remove, reset and relink it won't. Useless garbage.  Poorly designed. Uncomfortable to wear.  The app info is not very informative or useful.  This product and its software need to be redesigned from scratch.  Amazon should refund every customer or provide a new remodeled unit without asking.  I have never had these problems with Fitbit, Garmin.  Don't BUY THIS.",1
4612,"These business models of subscription fees for the rest of your life are a joke. Give me a one time fee of $99 or something don't you dare try to charge me a membership fee for the rest of my life. Over the course of  10 years and this device costs you at least $500. If you live to 80 years old this device could cost you nearly $3,000.",1
4613,"It's bad enough that this thing tracks everything a heart rate monitor and digital accelerometer can track... It then charges you a monthly fee for the privilege of being told you're not exercising enough.Think of it as a sort of employee tracker, but you wear it and then have to keep giving Amazon money so you can keep using all the features.",1

4615,Stole the ip after hearing whoops pitch to get investors,1
4616,"Steps were okay not a big deal. But Fat % showed variation of 5-10% every new scan.Idle time feels like it calculates idle time (short breaks) between workouts.The band quality itself is not so great, would have preferred metal or silicone alternatives, this one absorbs sweat or water.The band is either too tight or too loose. if its too tight, it clots my arm, if its too loose, it keeps hitting my wrist.",1
4617,I got in and got one before it was open to everyone ... it was stupid it didn’t track stuff right and the sleep setting was way off and it claims it’s water resistant or whatever but I was washing dishes and it zapped me... it’s not worth the $74 it’s selling for... it did heart beat and that’s about it also it made my wrist hurt as you gotta have it tight,1
4618,I love it so far! Definitely motivating me to be more active,5
4619,You're wearing a tracking device that tells you you're fat and your voice is overbearing... Do you really need an ex spouse strapped to your wrist to make you feel bad about yourself when you don't do what they want your to?Do you like abusive relationships that much that you want one strapped to you? This is just a Jeff Bezos listening device.... WAKE UP!!,1
4620,I am so disappointed in this halo. It seems to track my activity ok (but how could I reall know???) but it only tracks my sleep about half the time. I have followed all directions and done all the trouble shooting I can think of and now it's not even pairing with my phone to use the app. I am glad I got it for free through WW or I would demand my money back.,1
4621,"I love the idea of a fabric band, smaller form factor, easier to go to sleep with, less screens to look at :). When will we get this in Canada? We’re next door to Seattle and been waiting for an year now.",5
4622,"I have tried most of the mainstream health trackers. Fitbit, apple, Garmin, polar. Based on the reviews of the Amazon Halo, I will likely not even try. Halo's negative reviews on its bulk, comfort, readings, and aesthetics makes it sound like this product will be a fail.",1
4623,"Bought one as a present for my mom's birthdayWe live in Ecuador and when we tried to install it we realized the app is not supported in our country, so it's useless. Big miss on our part for not doing a better research but I do believe they should have a better warning.",1
4624,"Honestly the invasion of privacy is so blatant now that its obvious they don't care. The audio analysis is terrible, and it is painfully obvious that this feature is only there as an excuse for amazon to have your conversations and give you targeted ads. Just plain terrible in my opinion.",1

4627,"Just not up with the technology yet…thought this product would be an affordable fitness/health option, but I am going back to WHOOP. They’re just far superior on the data, it’s that simple. Hoping Halo will eventually make adjustments down the run to compete with others",1

4632,Piece of junk.,1
4633,"After using it over the last month and a half, I can tell you definitively that it does not function at tracking activities. A user is left to manually enter activities. What's the point of the device then, Interesting to track sleep but also returns questionable results.",1
4634,"Product has very little to offer over its competitors whilst still requiring a subscription to use long-term.  I have an Apple watch and it tracks everything this does except my 'mood' using my voice, and body fat percentage, which it calculates through pictures, not the band.",1
4635,"Some of these reviews have me rolling my eyes. Giving a bad review based on a feature it doesn't have and not advertised. Also, The complaints of it being hard and bulky and it hurts are just ridiculous. These people really need to just get off there but and move around and they will see results but instead they sit on the computer and write reviews of how tough it is to wear. Bottom line is, don't read the reviews. Buy it and try for yourself. I mean it's 100pct returnable so what can go wrong?",5
4636,Jeff Bezos just wants to know when I'm rubbing one out. No thanks.,1

The labs are awesome and there's tons of them. The tone feature is fascinating and has motivated me to mind my words and tone much more than I ever have. The activity score is much more motivating than anything fitbit has. There may be a better watch out there than this but it is certainly not a fitbit.",5
4657,Omg! I wish I had the money for one if this 😍 does it support whatsapp and others (social) apps?,5
4658,"I’m not generally a wearables person...I don’t want to be distracted by data 24/7. But I’m also pretty active and like to see how I’m progressing against my health goals every once in a while. My friend bought this as a gift for me for my birthday, and after being apprehensive at first, I actually really enjoy it. I like that it’s a more holistic version of my personal health without pinging and buzzing all day.",5
4659,Also this isn't for you participation trophy sensitive types that cant come to terms with your appearance.If you can than this can be a great little device in your health and wellness journey.,5
4660,"I love this tracker. I like that it's screen free. The band is comfortable. I don't recommended the pink band, it shows dirt super easy. I like the labs. I feel like it's a challenge to do them, and it keeps me motivated. This was the right move for me. I switched from Fitbit Versa. Probably won't be going back.",5

 I recently used Fitimage App and it provides bodyfat and body measurement from user's images.It also cost less in the subscription.",1
4662,Very comfortable. Better feeling than apple watch I used in the past. I like that it's not a watch with sounds and pop ups constantly. Does exactly what it says it does. It's simple and clean looking. Great device.,5
4663,The body fat scanner and the tone feature are why you need this fitness tracker! It’s a fun way to get more information and data about yourself than the typical fitness band,5
4664,"I paid a hundred bucks to be told I'm fat and angry. Finally, some honesty in my life. A+ would buy again.",5
4665,I love the hall it is apart of my life now,5
4666,Attractive. Comfortable. Works great.,5
4667,"I have only had this tracker for a few days - so can't comment on durability - but right away, I have some good feedback on the interface and tracking, and some of the features I like.But the most important reason I wanted to write this review was that I was ""on the fence"" about this product because of some of the negative reviews here that are marked as ""helpful"" - that I was surprised to learn were not accurate here.1: The tracker is NOT discouraging - someone said it expects 150 points per day, and they had worked out a lot of only got 50 points - but the tracker expects me to get 150 points per WEEK.  I'm averaging 40-70 points per day, mostly chasing my kids around, but also some small workout time - and when I broke through 150 points, it gave me my next ""weekly target""2: i really like the ""movement"" section - which asked me to take a video of myself doing 6 motion exercises and then gave me some videos to do to help with the areas that I struggle the most with.3: fit - I find the fit band and tracker to fit well - i've used FitBit in the past, and this feels ""as good"" or better.  I also really like that it doesn't have a screen to distract me day/day.",5
4668,Had an Apple Watch (2 and 6) for 5 years was ready to try something else and get away from the screen. Looked at whoop but it was so expensive and didn’t seem to be much different than the Halo. Gave it a shot and have been thrilled with the data. It gives you the cold hard facts. If you don’t like being told you’re lazy or are in xyz shape this isn’t the product for you. If you’re looking to be told exactly how you’re doing it’s an easy choice. The sleep tracking is top notch and appears very accurate. I fell asleep on the couch and went to bed. Next morning it told me my sleep wasn’t great and was awake for 20 minutes which was the time getting to bed. Activity tracking is non gps as a downside but great for gym work. Complaint- the charging clip is mediocre. Magnetic charger would be preferred. I give the screen less band a plus. One less thing to have to look at and allows you to wear a watch. If you’re between this and the whoop I’d say give this a shot.,5
4669,"Style: Let's start with that I love the fact it doesn't have a screen. To me the Fitbit style screen is tacky when worn. I wear the Halo Non Screen Band on my right and a really nice watch on my left. It compliments each other when I dress up or down. That's big for me, because I have dress up for work every day in a suit. I hope they make a new version in this style.Tracking: I like that it tracks body fat. It's off by a little %, but that's fine to at least have a marker. Steps are off by a little but not enough to through me out of wack. I like the meal plans and meditation.Voice Recorder: This is the reason I actually went this one. First let me say you can disable this option. I prefer it on because I can look back at the day and measure if I spoke confident or with anxiety. It also has a feature where you can mark conversations. I mark it for all my presentations and dates. As an example on my last date it said I spoke disinterested when I was. So now I can go back on meditate on my errors. I honestly don't understand why people freak about this feature. It's great! Especially if you suffer from anxiety and want to speak more confident.Overall I think this the best Fitness Tracker I ever owned. It has Style, Progress Programs, Body Fat measurements, and voice analytics to improve your daily interactions with loved ones, bosses, and strangers. I highly recommend this one.",5
4670,"I haven't had it long so there is still stuff I need to figure out but I can say that there are plenty of things that I have been annoyed with, and feel like could use improvement.The app is very frustrating to browse through. It's extremely sluggish. It takes a lot of time for things to load and react and you have to click through too many things to get to the things you want to view. The front page is loaded with things that seem nice but would be better suited somewhere else. It should be more streamlined and show the information you need to see. Currently it almost seems like a giant ad page instead.While it's full of things to do it's hard to find the things that I want to do. It's too busy telling you about new things that it takes forever to find the programs that I'm already apart of. And the lack of a search bar function means trying to narrow down searches means having to physically go through a list of things and manually checking things off.It also gives you good tracking information but I find it odd that the same tracking doesn't offer you tips on how to remedy the problem it tells you about. For instance the sleep tracker keeps saying that my REM cycle is abnormally high. About double of what is considered standard but it hasn't offered any kind of insight onto why that might be the case or how I might be able to get it in a normal range. Or if I even need to?The tone feature seems lacking. Perhaps I need to redo the setup but it doesn't capture nearly as many moments as I think it should. Maybe 2 or 5 things in the whole day. And while I don't know how to improve the feature without breaching privacy it doesn't tell you what those moments are. It just tells you ""you sounded happy"" it would be nice if it captured something to remind you of the moment. Maybe a few keywords from the moment or something.The app is also annoying with how much trouble it has syncing with the band. I have to spend several minutes each time I open it trying to get it to sync and update and I have to refresh it constantly while browsing because pages won't load.With all that being said though as of currently I'm enjoying the idea of the band and having something that I can focus on and try to get some things on track and keep me motivated. I found myself getting up and just briskly walking for a few minutes to get some points when before I'd just choose to sit.",4
4671,"I love that this looks like a bracelet more than a watch. I had a Garmin in the last and I was easily distracted by it, constantly wanting to check my stats. This one, not so much. And it logs everything! Halo has determined where I need mire mobility and stabilization in my body, and has recommended exercises (that I'm doing) to correct those areas. Unlike ither programs where I thought I was doing the right thing for my body and I wasn't.Oh and it actually fits my extremely small wrist, wich is hard to come by.=) My only complaint, Amazon, is that there are no goals or meal ideas for weight gaining,  only for loss. I realize being underweight isn't as common as being overweight,  but it's still a health issue for a lot of people, and for many reasons. I would absolutely love to see some tips, exercises, & meal prep for healthy weight GAIN. This is about making ALL body types better, isn't it? Not just overweight people ?I badly want to work out and stay heart healthy, but I dont want to lose weight while doing so.Other than not having a weight gain option,  which is an issue for every health stats smart watch  or health program, I love this band amd I highly recommend it.",5
4672,"Update to 5 stars - The replacement is working well. They credited me for about half of the return shipping. I do love the activity watch, mainly using it for tracking sleep. I do hope this replacement lasts longer than the original!Update to 3 stars - a few hours after posting the review, I was contacted by customer service and offered a replacement. I had to pay to return the broken Halo, which was a bummer. I am supposed to receive the new one in a few days and I hope it lasts longer than 4 months.Original review 1 star - Purchased June 20th and it stopped working October 25th.I absolutely loved the band until it stopped working. It is minimalistic, comfortable, seems to give accurate data, and didn't interfere with sleeping. Never had any issues with charging it, easy peasy. No issues with battery life either.Then it completely stopped working. Tried factory reset. Tried charging it. Nothing worked. So I hop on Amazon and read the reviews to see if it has happened to anyone else.... low and behold, my device stopped working in the same time frame as so many others.",5
4673,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Having set it up immediately and fully charged it I put it on right away and set up everything. Voice tone, sleep, exercise, all of it. It's fantastic. I know the starting membership comes with it but also the monthly subscription once the term is over is very reasonable and the options to store recipes and exercises in the app along with a body avatar to track results makes this way out class the others that shall not be named.Update: I have had my Halo a week now and I gotta say I'm already seeing results in my activity tracking and even my sleep with the apps available like the guided breathing meditation. I wish there were 10 stars.Progress Update: I am showing some real improvement in my sleep at 12 days I've included pix of my sleep chart and last night's best sleep in ever.",5
4674,"I love my Halo and gifted my whole family one.  Finally, my energy level (moods) makes sense based on my sleeping patterns.  It has many fun features like body fat and movement evaluator.  I like the corrective exercises it suggests and they did work for me.  The additional music/stories/meditation/etc. are very good and you may not need to purchase any other type of mediation apps.One thing that is very annoying.  You listen to a night meditation that is designed to put you to sleep.  It is working great and you fall asleep finding your phone out of battery in the morning.  For heaven's sake, why is the phone not shutting down once the program is finished?",5
4675,I am loving how lightweight and thin it is.  I have to get used to not looking at it for the time..lol  So used to my other fitness watch.  I do love that it is very motivating.  It makes me want to get up and move.  It has made me more aware of being too sedentary.  I work from home and this helps push me to get up and maybe walk up and down the stairs a few times every hour just to keep the blood flowing.  The sleep score is so helpful.  I have not tried the body fat scan but I am going to do that later today and then update at another time.,5
4676,"I like everything about the halo! Besides having to charge it frequently it’s solid. I do manual labor so this is the device for you. It has no screen to break. Pair it with my G-Shock on my other wrist and I have no need for a smart watch! I’m very happy I’m not looking at my wrist constantly, opening emails and texts(get engaged with the real world people!) check it after work and occasionally during work if my anxiety is bad. This has helped my anxiety tremendously! The app has all kinds of wellness tips and the heart rate monitor is spot on. Buy this and talk to people not your watch!",5
4677,It fit great..My wrist is small. The reason I returned it was because the sleep accuracy was silly. That was the main reason I bought it. Being an insomniac. I recently changed meds and wanted to see if I was sleeping at all. ( I figured 2 or 3 hours) The band was saying I was sleeping 8 - 9 hours a night.( I WISH) LOL. NO- I think it must count the entire time your laying down. If you don't need it for that I'm sure it's great. Everything else about it was pretty cool. The pink band became dirty very quickly though.,3
4678,I love my Halo band.  I’ve previously used 3 Fitbit trackers.  None were as comfortable as Halo  I love how Halo gives me a breakdown of sleep patterns.  It offers recipes as well as exercise programs.  The most beneficial feature for me is the heart rate feature.  One evening I just didn’t feel right.  I checked my heart rate on my halo snd found that it was beating faster and faster.  Paramedics were called. I took a little ride with them.  It was a good thing my halo band knew I had a problem.,4
4679,"Having no display is the best! It reduces the normal distraction of an activity tracker with a screen. Also, is anyone really satisfied with the display/touchscreen on any of the activity trackers out there? It's better to just not have it. It also allows me to wear my favorite timepiece on the other wrist without looking like I have two watches on. Lastly, this is the only activity tracker that I am able to comfortably wear while sleeping. So happy with this. Amazon, please keep the no-display Halo alive forever and keep improving it.",5
4680,"I have been using it since they invited me to test it a few years back. I really like that it tracks my sleep, not only it tracks my sleep but offer suggestions in how to sleep better. I used fitbit before this and the watch lasted me only for a year. I have had this watch since December 2020. It still works like new. The mobile app is very easy to use and is easily accessible. I highly recommend it",5
4681,"I have always had trouble sleeping, this helps me understand why, I'm trying to hack my body in various ways. I sleep better when I take a little time to exercise usually. That doesn't always work but it's good for me regardless.I love the graphs and they provide a lot of information, lots of ways to fall asleep, I use the same one every night. I wish I could favorite certain programs so that I wouldn't have to scroll over every time I used the sleep section.",5
4682,I have been RAVING about this since I got it!!I love the sleep tracker and the programs that come along with it are phenomenal!! Binaural beats  have me zonked quickly! The body scanner is accurate and the mini minute session provided to assist in your health journey are wonderful! My favorite part is that the face is covered so I’m not distracted by it like an Apple Watch. It keeps my steps and even my tone of voice throughout the day. I can’t say enough good things!,5
4683,"I use a cPap for breathing assistance.  I get at least 8 hours of sleep a night, and wake up refreshed.  Halo tells me my sleep is poor or fair, once it said I was awake for 5 of 9 hours!  There are too many rules for wearing the halo to bed.  It will probably work if you sleep on your back, but not for side sleepers who like to put their hand under the pillow.",2
4684,"After having used fitbit for a few years, I had to stop wearing it because I kept getting rashes under the plastic.  I liked the Halo off the bat because the strap is cloth.  The system Halo uses - points, instead of step tracking - really motivates me to get in the points.  I don't use all the features, like tone analysis or movement, but I like the sleep tracking and the activity tracker.  So far I find it really useful and an upgrade to the fitbit I was using, as well as more comfortable and less obtrusive (I find it has a smaller 'footprint' than the fitbit as well).",5
4685,I purchased the band (without the face) because I did not want issues with the band breaking. I am super surprised! I do not miss the screen at all! The app and services it provides is wonderful. After having a mass removed from my heart I like to keep track of my heart rate. This app has helped me improve my life and health. Completely worth it!,5
4686,"If you wanna watch this isn't for you, battery is not great they say it last two days, but it barely lasts one day. It has great workouts on the app, But I wish it had a community like the Fitbit. I like that it's waterproof, and simple, and I like the voice recognition thing but I don't know about the sleep tracking it seems a little off but it's worth trying a little bit longer",2
4687,"I’m obsessed with this thing. The big draw for me is no interface, so it doesn’t distract me during workout or when I’m at work. It’s simply a fitness tracker and pretty accurate. It definitely motivates me.",5
4688,I don't have my halo band very long so I'm learning as I go but what I do know love. Although sometimes when I look at the app I'm disappointed at myself when I have lazy days. My favorite part is they way it monitors my sleeping pattern. Hopefully I'll be able to moderate my sleep pattern so I get a better sleeping score.,5
4689,"Very good tracker I think, but excellent app. Fantastic battery life. The only issue is that it does not seem to track high heart rate well during my workouts, consistently far lower than my Apple Watch (when I am completely pushing it and can feel I am near max heart rate it registers something much lower). This issue seems worse when gripping things such as weights - Apple Watch seems to account for that somehow and while it will lose heart rate, seems to pick it up faster once setting the weight down.But again, the app is fantastic with many helpful tips, programs, options. Battery life fantastic. And if you do workouts that don’t involve lots of gripping, then the issue above is a non-issue.",4
4690,"Like so many who have reported one stars, I immediately started breaking out upon using this device. What was hilariously infuriating was when I called Amazon customer support for a solution, the TWO technicians that I spoke with both pretended like my allergic reaction was an entirely UNHEARD of issue with the Halo.",1
4691,Fitbit and other bands after a week or two make me break out. This band has not done that to me. So a win there. The battery lasts a long time without charging and charging is super quick. I like the app. A few things I might change but as a whole it is good. The only real thing I hate is that the band is not interchangeable. You buy onyx....you are stuck with it until you buy a whole new device.,5
4692,"I’ve had multiple Apple watch’s but always wondered how accurate they are.  In my opinion, Halo is extremely easy to use and provides a more detailed view of your overall health and exercise.  I am a hard core gym rat and I love the ease of the Halo.  I would recommend this device for all athletic abilities.",5
4693,"Was worried about how well this product would be for the price, but it has exceeded my expectations.  It is very intuitive and informative.  In just 5 days it has helped me to create a healthier lifestyle for myself.  It motivates you to reach new activity goals.  It explains the meaning behind your scores and is very discreet on your wrist. Highly recommend to anyone looking to improve their physical and mental health.",5
4694,I love my Halo so far. I’ve had an Apple Watch before but I truly don’t care about being reminded to breath each day. The Halo App is fantastic and offers more than what an Apple Watch is but without a screen. This is strictly a preferential feature. I see enough screens every day to the point where it is a relief that the Halo comes without one. Overall I am very impressed with the instructions it comes with and the bodily screens and suggestions as to how to get better. It’s like a whoop but not a high monthly fee and instead it’s an upfront cost for the band itself. Consider me a fan,5
4695,"It's not perfect, the charging could be easier, the battery could last longer, and more apps could work with it. However, it seems to do much better at tracking than the fit bits I've had.If you want a tracker that overestimates calories burnt and tells you good job even though you aren't doing enough to make real changes, go with a fit bit. If you want something more honest with you then get this. Maybe the truth is demotivating to some people but I prefer it.  The tone is a little silly though, I'd just turn that off and get longer battery life.",4
4696,"I've had this about 3 months now, and I like it. It's comfortable. I got it on sale, bc o didn't want to spend a ton on a fitness tracker. It's pretty accurate with my step count and heart rate. I find it helps motivate me to exercise more.",5
4697,It is an excellent band. It took me a while to pair it with an iPhone pro 12. After a few tries finally did it. Once paired works great. The heart rate is not accurate while weight lifting but when cycling works excellent.,5
4698,"This band is amazing if you are in a safety sensitive job that doesn't allow you to have cellular devices.  It tracks efficiently and the features are amazing. You are able to take progress photos in the app, it give you guided workouts and also has a movement feature that can score your mobility.",5
4699,"This product doesn’t work outside US. Unfortunately I didn’t realize that until I received the product. I can’t returned because it is already in Colombia. So, don’t buy it If you don’t live in US",1
4700,"I didn't want a Fitbit with a breakable screen.  Love the app, and will pay when the 6 month trial is done.  It tracks sleep better than any app.  Step counter is more accurate than any app.  I absolutely love it.",5
4701,at first it takes a while to get used to having it on your arm. but after awhile its like a second skin. works very well and the app will tell you when it needs to be charged so it doesnt just die on you. very nice device so glad i got one,5
4702,This has worked so well as I found my sleeping habits need some help and I like when it tells me to change my tone when I speak🤗,5
4703,"I like the services it provides however, it was originally advertised ad a great way not to be distracted and now, a visual Halo is coming out 😶",2
4704,"I love the sleep tracker and it is very accurate. I love the other features such as recipes and workouts included in the app. The tone analysis is useless. I wish they would tell you what you said that made it judge your voice. Either way, I’m glad I bought it and I finally bought on for my husband too.",5
4705,Seems half baked with Mickey Mouse features and questionable accuracy.  I like the concept and will try a future version.,1
4706,"It's a really good price, not sure about the sleep tracking",5
4707,This is a awesome tacker. i have wanted the whoop for some time but cant see the need to spend on a monthly subscription. This tracker does it all.,5
4708,I wanted to be able to track my sleep and steps and this does a good job,5
4709,Great fit and I love the long lasting battery,5
4710,"The halo is great, especially the sleep tracking function.  Me and my friends wear them and compete to see who burns the most calories. There should be an option where you can view your friends who also use the halo and see there stats for the day. If there was a comely I’ve leaderboard type interface this thing would be next level. Great battery tho and barely notice it on my wrist.",5
4711,"The reviews about the tone and body scan, if you don’t set them up they don’t exist. Was going to buy a W but back ordered for months. The Halo gives me all the data I want. Sleep. Opportunity to set live activity like running, cycling…heart rate during the activity. Run the cost. Set the right expectations. If you don’t like it, Amazon is great with returns.",5
4712,Wasn't a good gift for who I got it for. Zero interest.,5
4713,It will not work outside the US.... Amazon once more treats outside USA citizen as second class people...,1
4714,"Nice product but found i didnt use it much because I needed a watch too, returned after 2 weeks",2
4715,Im disappointed that it doesn’t do much. Does track heart rate well. The app is good for meditation.,2
4716,Love how you the sleep tracker works. It’s great,5
4717,I use it mainly to track my sleep. I have an Apple Watch but prefer this when sleeping due to the size,5
4718,Great product the app has some glitches,5
4719,Love everything about this,4
4720,"I personally like this so much more than my Apple Watch. I like how there isn’t a screen, it took a month of wearing my Apple Watch when the screen cracked and is covered in scratches. I also like how everything is in one app rather than multiple apps on your phone.",5
4721,"The media could not be loaded.

4722,Purchased this for only $79 a month ago and it has only come off for showering and minimal charging. A great way to track your day!,5
4723,Keeps me informed.,5

4730,The only thing I don't like is it wont sync to my samsung health app. Otherwise I love it,4
4731,So sleek and and great tracking. Encourages to be more active,5
4732,"Everything worked perfect until I tried to connect it to a new phone.I tried to connect the band again after not using it for a few months and it wouldn't send me the code to register it to my account. After 2 days of talking to customer service reps going in circles, they couldn't figure out why I wasn't getting the code at my e mail address to finalize the setup process.So now I have a pointless piece of junk in my drawer unless I want to set up a totally new prime account and forgo my free trial months.This isn't the firs Amazon device I am having issues with, somethings going on and I'm thinking it's better to walk away while I am ahead of the game, Good luck everyone.",3
4733,Not having an alarm function was the killer for me. Having a spouse with a different wake up time necessitates a silent alarm. My fitbit had it. This does not. Complete deal breaker. Also the battery life is decimated if you have it listen to your tone. Pass. Nice try amazon. Back to the drawing board.,2
4734,"This device has pluses and minuses, I like the no screen it's very discreet.  The battery life sucks.  I wear both a fitbit that's a year old and this one that I was selected for the preview at the beginning of the month.  I charged both fully on Friday and they are basically at the same rate. It's not bad bad 76% based upon what I use it for it seems like high usage.  Again I was expecting more life on the newer one.  I don't use tone or body scanner at the moment.  The body scanner .. oof .. i had an eating disorder in high school and I worry about many triggers.  I'm actively paying attention to my health right now. I think it's just better I don't see how i look-12% body fat.  have concerns for young people getting trapped in body dismorphia. I really want to use the tone however the battery usage is just crazy I think I will for things that are work related where I know I personally can sound more exasperated from the situation.  That won't hurt at all.I don't feel the sleep score is accurate I have times I have been awake through the night and it doesn't record I mean I know I'm restless based upon what my fitbit says.I have had a little skin irritation with my fitbit.  That's more about the constant hand washings plus antibacterial soap. I was able to fix that by making sure I take my device off and cleaning the band.  This one has not given me that issue.  It fits weird on my wrist and it hits the pisiform bone. That does become a little sore for me. I don't know why I can't get it to set differently.What I do like .. I love the step/activity tracker. It's pointed out much to my annoyance how much time I'm sedentary.  It's really kind of scary as a middle aged adult I had no idea.  So it's been a wonderful motivator to move and see where I can be more active.  My goal in points is 150+ right now and that has been perfect. My young dog loves it because we go for nice relaxing walks 3 to 4x on the weekends and at least 2x during the week.  We get out often for shorter.  He's been a happy little guy.  So of you are looking for motivation this is it.The 99$ in my book is steep price wise and I wouldn't have purchased at that price plus the app fee it's not a cheap toy.  $69 was right in my budget and based upon what you get in the app price I may not keep that portion active at the end of the trial.I still prefer my fitbit versa 2 this has been an educational lesson and I'm not sorry I got to participate in it.  :)",3
4735,"This device gives inconsistent and inaccurate results, and it is super uncomfortable, much less comfortable than my Galaxy Active Watch 2. The battery life is great, and I like that it does not have a screen. I love the idea of the body scan features, and the sleep tracking shows promise.

4739,"I’m only about two weeks into it, but I  feel like I’ve had some high sleep scores on nights where I haven’t slept very well, and low scores on nights I’ve slept really good.I think I’m going to like it, once I figure it out.",5
4740,"Was excited and waited for this product since it’s announcement. But am soooo disappointed that it missed out on basic necessities . While it has some cool and good  features on the app like sleep tracking etc, it has no ability to track steps and distance on the go. What that means is you need to carry your mobile with you when running, jogging etc which is impossible. Not worth the value of money. Would go look at other fitness apps.",1
4741,"For the price, this device is feature rich and better than most ‘dumb’ devices (single measurement). Analysis seems inferred, leaving me unsure of the quality of the insights. Also, sleep analysis seems to alter upon second app open vs initial reading. Overall it’s a low cost solution that I’m finding I’m more interested in wearing/using than Fitbit or other health monitors.",4
4742,"I've been going good with this band, but I ended up now being allergic to the band. Waste of money now!",1
4743,,5
4744,definitely beta software but it has a lot of potential,5
4745,I love it however I feel the device could be better quality.,5
4746,I was really pleased with the Halo. In the end it just wasn't for me. In addition the band irritated my skin. I returned the Halo.,4
4747,Worthless and expensive,1
4748,The only thing I disliked about the device is the battery it literally only last for about 24 hours before having to recharge....,5
4749,"Device died after a couple months of use.  Wouldn't charge up anymore.I appreciated the heartrate monitoring and activity monitoring.  It was fairly accurate.Sleep tracking:Questionable on sleep tracking.  Mainly that it was interesting to see what it said about ""time to fall asleep.""  It usually said something ridiculous like 1-3 minutes.  Suggestion: allow the user to specify via special click sequence with the physical button on the side to suggest ""i'm going to bed""Mobile app:CLUTTERED.  lots of suggestions.  It like the echo show devices with the ""Try bla bla..,"" but on steroids. They really need to clean up the interface to make it more intuitiveBody scan: neat feature.  Just wished I had more time to make more scans, but the device died.Accuracy: spoke to this a bit with sleep, but in general, it would be nice to ""tell"" the device I'm about to start a workout with a special click sequence.  I think this would help a bit.Voice: Turned off voice functions after a couple days. It zaps the battery like crazy, even if you have it muted/disabled.  Had to reset the device and wipe the voice model stored so it would return to its battery life of 6-8 days.Battery: As mentioned - battery is great with the voice function turned off, and it charged quickly (while it was alive).  However, my device went dead after a couple months, so ... not good.Comfort: ended up wearing my device on the underside of my wrist, rather than on top.  The slight bulge from the base of the device caused great discomfort after a couple of days.Membership: the membership included for 6 months is not being properly honored.  My device died at the beginning of the month and I'll get my replacement at the end of the month.  I asked for 1 month to be added to my halo membership and was refused flat out.  Horrid customer experience, since I am beta testing your device for you. It does include quite a few little gamified things to help you get fit.  It's 3.99 a month (i think) and if you're paying attention, there is some value in this.Bottom line:  Roll the dice with this device.  I can't in good conscience give it higher than 2 stars right now because it died on me so fast.  The replacement process has been painful and customer service seems to be a dirty word for the halo team.  I was polite and reasonable in my ask, but they refuse to meet me in the middle.",2
4750,I like everything about the halo except the fact that it does not have a display on it.  Didn’t think I would miss it but I really really do,3
4751,I can't get it to recognize my sleep patterns at all. The battery life is lousy. It dies in less than 24 hours  I love the option possibilities.,3
4752,The only thing I don't like is I can't see the face I really wish I could and they had that option but I chose wrong the product is great I just wish I had got the one with a face,5
4753,Not worth the cost and not worth a monthly fee.. The unit could never hear me and trying to set up the voice feature was a nightmare.. I even replaced it thinking I had a defective unit .. nothing.. top that with the cost for monthly app subscription and it just does not add up .. the app is not even run by amazon..could not get customer service and they want a fee for that... ummm.. that's a noI bought a cheapie fitness tracker for 25 bucks that is much much better.,1
4754,"I think this is a MUST HAVE, wonder why no one else took the time to design something that helps with your actual life exchanges and goals.",5
4755,I'm at a loss with this thing. It worked for about a week and then it didn't. I had to remove the app and start over. Again it worked for a few days and now I'm trying for the third time to get this running for more than a week. This is more trouble than its worth.,1
4756,good app band features comfortable new intriguing.,5
4757,"The device keeps losing its Bluetooth connection. I haven’t had this problem with other fitness trackers —. Apple Watch or Fitbit — so I think it is this device. It is difficult if not impossible to reset it once this happens and, if I do that, it loses all previously stored data. I’ve just given up on it and will stop wearing it.",1
4758,"Sleep tracking never works. I went from a fitbit to this for smaller device but it never seems to be able to ""catch"" anything.",2
4759,Not motivating. Just not for me. Can’t buy new bands on Amazon. Can’t stay charged very long. Doesn’t give me the information I personally need to get moving.... charge died so quick I had really bad data feed back.,5
4760,"Pros- The band is great - comfortable, not bulky, and stylish. I love how easy it is to switch bands as well. I was very surprised. I tried changing the band on my sons fitbit and it was nearly impossible. This just pops right out! Happy with the battery life as well.Cons- The app is garbage. It does a million pointless things and nothing I actually use.Activity Points - I don't want a point system in which I have to click through to find Steps for the day. The default display should be Steps.Tone - Pointless, it kills the battery and no one cares how a fitness tracker perceives their tone of voice. A better, more useful Live feature would have been - Body Temperature. This would be handy currently during this pandemic, is also useful for ovulation tracking and general wellness.Labs - Again pointless filler. Would much rather have a food diary feature, be able to add water intake, weight loss tracker, calorie tracker.",3
4761,"This was a terrible experience:-Battery burns out fast-The cool thing (body scan) doesn’t even require the band-$4 a month for what now?-Charger broke and they’re expensive-Even so, I wanted to reactivate just for the body scan. Amazon made it hell. I chatted with 7 people who kept escalating since it’s impossible to reactivate an old band on the website. Never heard back from the “escalation to the Halo product team.” They just kept sending me a link then transferring me to someone else. F this product.",3
4762,"As I use a walker the activity tracker did not work for me since my arms don't swing that much with walking. It registered about half the time I was in bed for the sleep tracking the first night, not at all on a nap I took nor on the second night.  I had it snug but not to the point of cutting circulation.",2
4763,"I really wanted to like the Halo but I don’t like that it has to be fitted to my arm, it’s very annoying. It’s also a little heavy to have on all the time. I prefer the old Fitbit because it’s more like a bracelet and isn’t strapped to my arm with a band. I’m sure it won’t bother some people but it’s a no for me. I’m stuck with it now, just glad I didn’t pay full price.",2
4764,I really want to like this but it will not measure my heart rate in the live mode it constantly turns off the microphone on its own and it always thinks it's not on my wrist even though it is and I have it set for the proper wrist wearing in settings. There is absolutely nobody at Amazon who knows how to help you with it for technical support and the only videos that are included in the help me with my item section are videos that do not pertain to this item. Smarten up Amazon. This is your own product and you don't have tech support?,1
4765,Do not like this product. Very glitchy and stops working almost immediately.,1
4766,This doesn’t seem accurate to me. How can a 45 minute workout (walk/run) burn 1000 calories? & only 32 minutes of it was intense (running up hill). Context: I take the mountain bike trails and generally run up hills and walk down them (especially the steep ones with roots).,3
4767,"I am loving my halo.  It's lightweight, easy to use, waterproof so you don't have to take it off, charging is fast and only needed every 5 days or so, and it texts you when it's fully charged.  The weekly goals are very motivating (instead of that 10,000 steps/day). I like that it knows that i went for a run, or walk, etc. and when, for how long, and the intensity. It does take off points if you're sedentary for hours which IMHO is very appropriate. If you can't get to 150 points, i would be very concerned about your health - cause you're not moving!  All of the data is on the app which easily syncs (another plus). I am a runner, so you don't see your data until you download onto the app, but that's okay for me.  Sleep data seems very accurate. And I like the sleep stories and workout videos included. And the price is very reasonable.  All in all, Amazon did it again!",5
4768,I like that it tracks more than my steps and gives tips and guidelines to be more active,5
4769,I was so impressed with this that I am now upgrading to the new Amazon Halo band. If you are hesitant to go for the new more expensive one and are considering this one - go for it! I absolutely LOVE this!,5
4770,Got this for health tracking and it has paid off.,5
4771,The watch is ok Idk if it’s the watch or charger but within days of getting it the charger broke.,4
4772,Great that you don’t have to charge it everyday. I charge it every fifth day. Sleep measuring is very good. My wife and I enjoy the competition.,4
4773,I really like the watch but what I don’t like is not having the time on it. I’m not sure I’ll be keeping the band but it’s a great product but maybe just not for me.The band is amazing. It works great. Have to charge it about every 2 days for an hour or so. Not very long. Very interesting. I loved how it gives you the option to do an assessment and then gives you videos to help you with what you need to work on. It’s not too big or bulky.,5
4774,"I thought it would be something that would help me get in better shape, but it’s helped my overall well being.  The sleep tracker and the mood tracker are my favorites. To see how important good sleep is to my daily routine has been eye opening and become a competition between the fam.  Seeing how mood changes between work and home has definitely made me see how important a work home life balance is.  I’m way happier when I’m in my home than in the office. It’s way more in tune with your body than any other app I’ve used.  From body shape to activity it’s just different than all the others.  I highly recommend.",5
4775,"Horrible.Lowered my quality of life, did not provide any beneficial insights.Returned it after four days.Depressing gadget and just awful.Don’t get it.",1
4776,"I actually like this device, i bought it because it helps me track my sleep at night and my steps. But with all good things there is 1 issue. BATTERY LIFE SUCKS!!! AY 1ST IT WOULD GO 3-4 DAYS BEFORE I HAVE to charge it, now maybe 2 days at thats woth using minimal features...,",3
4777,"I’ve been using this for about a month now, and when it’s working properly, I love it!However, it keeps disconnecting from the app, and it hasn’t tracked any activity due to it not being able to sync with the app. I have followed all instructions and it just won’t stay connected. I hope I figure it out soon because I love this band! Especially the tone feature",3
4778,"A fitness tracker that does what it needs to do.The halo tracks all of the basic fitness elements that I want without all of the Wiz bang that the pro athlete would like. This is a simple easy to use device that tracks your activities, sleep, steps and calories seamlessly.The only real downside is you have to take it off to charge it but it only takes a short period of time to charge.Overall, for the price, and the monthly fee, this is a good device for essential fitness tracking for the average person.",5
4779,"I really wanted to like this thing but syncing and setup did not go well at all. Took several tries to get the thing to sync, then several tries to get the update to take. Once I got that all worked out I really had to fiddle with getting it positioned on the wrist to get a HR reading. Perhaps I just got a dud but regardless it is going back and I'll wait for next iteration.It is thicker than I thought it would be, a lower profile would be preferred. Probably this way to keep the initial cost down but since there is no display I don't see why it had to be so thick.",3
4780,I like the Halo a lot. I find the body scan very cool and the sleep tracker good. My only issue is that I find it slightly uncomfortable to wear on my wrist - after a while it hurt and requires a break.,4
4781,"I bought a Fitbit and it has worked everyday.  The Halo doesn't pick up all your data on any given day.  The Fitbit worked right out of the box, everyday.",1
4782,Very good product,5
4783,I love my fitness tracker until it stopped charging - after two weeks. Tried a new charger with no luck and I even bought off brands just to try. No luck - read the reviews and when charging isn’t an issue I might try again😤😩,2
4784,This thing is excellent accurate and not intrusive. No stupid notifications! It's light comfortable and not only does the body fat analysis help change diet and workout focus but the tone analysis helps change mood. Add to this the excellent insights and sleep tracking and this is the best tracker I have owned. Compatible to whoop but a ton cheaper and better metrics,5
4785,"For me, this is better than Fitbit.  Time will tell if it lasts longer than the Fitbit (I went through 4 Fitbits within 3 years).  The app is easy to use with tons of information.",5
4786,The fit is nice. The voice monitoring is very cool and allows me to see how I’m sounding to others. I also like the fitness tracking. It tells me where I need improvement.,5
4787,"This device is pretty awesome! The app features are helpful and sync to most of my fitness apps like WW for my sleep and activity.  I am hoping for the FitOn app to be added to track my workout activity soon. The body scan is okay. I accidentally wore a tummy control cami in my first scan, which altered the BMI by 5%.  I completed the remaining scans without a cami and tried to stay true to scale.  My favorite feature is Tone. It helps me be mindful of what I say when I say it. I like how it has a recording portion where I can record a live conversation to listen to how I respond to others.I did receive a faulty Halo, and Customer Service was awesome about assisting me with troubleshooting. Once we discovered the mic was bad, I received a new Halo and returned my old Halo hassle-free!This device is reasonably priced and user friendly. I would recommend this over a FitBit or other activity tracking device!",5
4788,"Love this product to bits! Amazing how it keeps a track of everything and my favorite is the body part where it scans your body and tells you the body fat % etc, also sleep tracking is amazing! Would highly recommend to anyone.However the only issue I had was with the fabric and it's color -  although I tend to wash it every now and then and keep it clean - the color has been faded and it doesn't really look pink anymore.",5
4789,"It’s a great tracker, but if you have an allergy to nickel, stay clear. My contact dermatitis on both wrists is still slowly clearing up. I’m wearing it with the tracker on the outside of my wrist. I was wearing it on the inside of my wrists. I’m watching it closely. Other than that, it really is a great tracker.",4
4790,"I have had the Halo since December 2020.  I was very excited to get it, since during the pandemic I have been exercising at home and I figured this would help me keep track of my activity.When I first starting using it, I thought the heart rate monitor was not accurate some of the time, since I would measure my own heart rate and occasionally the Halo did not match what I measured myself.  When I first got it, I would fan myself with a hand fan, while seated and the Halo said my heart rate was in the ""intense"" zone, which was DEFINITELY WRONG.  Then that stopped happening, but the Halo measured my heart rate lower than it actually was on several occasions.  I have updated the app on my phone numerous times and with each update, the Halo seems LESS & LESS accurate, except for the sleep measurement.I will still wear and use it, so that I am reminded not to sit too much while indoors, but I would NOT recommend it on the long term.",3
4791,Love my new band,5
4792,"The new Halo is a very cool device but I've been wearing my Apple Watch and Halo at the same time and steps are totally different from one to the other. Pros for Halo-the scan is great, the steps seem more accurate, and you don't have to press a button when starting to exercise. The tone part of Halo is interesting, but not sure how accurate it is. The sleep is much more detailed than the Apple Watch and I do like seeing it daily. It helps to know your patterns. Overall, I think the Halo is a great investment. Only reason I still wear Apple Watch is you can see time, texts, phone calls...where the Halo has no screen.",4
4793,"It worked well for the first 4 months, then... It seems the casing that covers the sensor on the inside came off and I'm not certain how to get it repaired or replaced.  The product support is only two videos to address two problems.",2
4794,"Initially, I loved this item but now I am disappointed with it.  13 months after I purchased, the item unpaired with my app and technical support was not able to help me reset.  Absolutely unacceptable that an item of this caliber would not work after 13 months.  Ridiculous.",1
4795,"I wound up returning this. I thought it would be cool because of some of the extra features it promoted, but it wound up being a huge disappointment.First, I had some issues with it not recording steps/activity. It was disconnecting from the app and had to be rebooted.I thought I would like the fact that it didn't have a screen so it would be less technology, but actually I found that this kept me tied down to my phone more. I couldn't just check this quickly for the time or my steps, I had to constantly check the phone which usually was a huge temptation to check other things once it was in my hand and contributed to more sitting.I didn't get the hang of the points thing at first. I had a ton of steps, but wasn't making my points. Finally, I realized that I just had to get my heart rate up. Literally about 15 min moderate walking while I talked on the phone did it. Suddenly I was on my way to being super fit according to this watch, which I found dubious.The sleep feature was pretty inaccurate. It takes me a while to fall asleep, but it consistently claimed I had fallen asleep quickly. As an added insult, it subtracted points during that time for being sedentary. If I got up in the middle of the night, it usually registered this as my wake up time instead of an interruption and again started counting the rest of my sleep against me as sedentary time. It gave me very high sleep scores even though I consistently feel exhausted.The workout videos seemed like a huge bonus, but they are tiny on my phone screen. I didn't even see a way to maximize the screen and it would only be helpful if there were some way to broadcast to the tv.The watch itself was very uncomfortable. It is too broad and flat. It should be made to contour more to the arm. I had trouble keeping it in place and after a couple days, had to switch arms. My arm was basically bruised and hurt to the touch for days afterwards, just about the time the other arm was hurting so much I had to switch back.There is only one button on the side of the watch. My 3 year old son quickly discovered this and kept pressing it every chance he got. It controlled several functions, so this was annoying. My husband just got me a galaxy fit2 and even though it has a colorful touch screen all he can do is scroll through it. He can't actually mess anything up functionally.The main reason I got this was because of the tone recognition thing. I'm not sure what I was looking for in this. I know I yell at my kids too much, so I was hoping it would help in some way, but it basically just checks in periodically and tells you what it heard tone-wise. It doesn't play you back to yourself, it doesn't alert you if you're losing your cool. I actually yelled a few times when I was wearing it and it didn't catch it. It rated me as basically neutral all the time. According to my husband, I am not a neutral person at all. I don't know what I was hoping for, but I'm not really sure what the purpose of this feature is except to try and make people feel better about themselves. I would say this feature is pretty much a gimmick and does drain the battery excessively.If this had been comfortable to wear and had basic functionality like a screen with the time and steps, I think it would have been acceptable at a much lower price (and I had a 30% discount).I will say that Amazon's customer service was absolutely phenomenal. When I started having problems I reached out and someone called me to help. He actually called back each day for a couple days to follow up and see how it was going. That alone really made me want to love this watch. He genuinely cared and my experience with Amazon is that they really stand behind their products. I kept this on the dresser quite a while before I finally decided I could not persuade myself to put it back on again. I am sure that a future reincarnation will have many of these issues addressed, but for right now, I could not recommend it.",3
4796,El producto me ayuda a seguir mi salud y monitorear los aspectos de nutrición,5
4797,Really enjoy this….tracks well and is very helpful!,5
4798,"I really like the video and audio programs for meditation, exercise, and sleep. I like that it helps track my daily activity by my pulse rate rather than by steps or me specifying what I am doing. It breaks data down a lot for me like various stages of activity from resting to intense. This tracker has me doing more than any other tracker has, but I only got it for my sleep. I'm having way too much fun trying to get healthy. Bedtime stories! whaaaat???!!! So cool! The only thing it doesn't do that might be nice is to track naps, but I did read that having more than 30 mins is unhealthy and would affect sleep habits anyway. So there is that. It will take pictures of your body and analyze them with loads of data. You can also make a video of you doing exercises and it will recommend corrective exercises to improve you.",4
4799,"I liked the features the halo offered. However, I did not like the interface of the app - specifically with sleep tracking. It was not detailed enough. I returned this to purchase a smart watch and it has a lot more features suited for me. The halo will be a great addition for someone who is interested in fitness tracking. I just missed having a watch! This product would be better if it had a display screen.",3
4800,"I’ve read so many bad reviews on the Halo, but I love it. It does exactly what it’s supposed to do. It’s comfortable and accurate. I’m 51 and I get motivated when I see the points add up. The image I uploaded was from today, an average day for me. With the membership you get workouts, mindfulness exercises, and recipes. It doesn’t have a ton of bells and whistles but its accurate and just what you need to monitor your fitness.",5
4801,"This is very disappointing, the sleep tracker says I am getting 2 hours a night, and it is telling me I am 25% body fat (according to my doctor I am between 9 and 12) the battery life is about a day if you have the time evaluator on (one of the best most interesting parts of the app)The step measure system is good, the sleep programs are excellent butNot enough diversity in stories to fall asleep to, the heart rate monitor works.Overall I believe you could get the same functionality from a $20 fitness tracker. The app adds value but I would definitely have rather bought a fit bit",1
4802,"It does everything it suppose to and had some more features than expected! If you wear it right below the wrist bone like it says to, it isn’t bulky or uncomfortable at all. Fits nice and is subtle. I love it! Calories tracker seems pretty accurate as well",5
4803,"What a horrible experience. I tried to like this thing but it's not accurate, I could never get the body scan to work after almost 20 attempts and Amazon replacing the unit with a new one. It just processes the scan and then comes back with an error and after waiting for two weeks from their escalation team, I gave up.The ""tone"" meter is a total battery hog so you will be charging it every other day if you use it. The sleep accuracy is not good and if you wake up but lay in bed a while, it is affecting your overall sleep score. So with no body scan capability, inaccurate sleep tracking, and not using the tone meter, its a bit of a waste.",2
4804,"This is better then my Apple Watch love that I can take a full body scan to track my weight, since I had my Halo I have lost up to 6 1/2 lbs. so it has kept me focus more on my exercises routine.",5
4805,"I love the Halo! I love the point system and the app is very easy to use. I love the breakdowns they give you for activity and sleep. The workouts available on the app are a great feature. I’ve already done a few and it’s nice that they are short. This allows me to do a fast workout on a break! The device is really light and I honestly forget I’m wearing it. The voice detection could be better. It does miss a lot. My main complaint is the cheap band it comes with. It’s a Velcro band and ended up giving me a rash. I have sensitive skin and there is some chemical used to make it that I’m allergic to. Other than that, it’s a great purchase!",4
4806,"The Halo is absolutely the best tracker I have had thus far. If you are ok with the Body and voice analysis, I am, if is phenomenal at letting you know everything about your daily health and activities plus its water-resistant - I can swim and shower with no problem.",5
4807,"Hard to connect to charger.  When try to remove from charger, band came off.Tone feature is useless unless you can remember what you were saying and to whom, many hours ago.  You cannot hear what you had said, just time marker.Need to wear a wristwatch with it, it doesn't offer time display.RETURNED IT",1
4808,I bought a new band for the haloFeels much betterI saw reviews on u-tube and other internet sitesEvery review say the original band is uncomfortableMuch more happier with the halo nowI am disappointed in Amazon when I called asking for a discount for the band they said no. I asked for the supervisor I got the runaroundUsually Amazon is really good at customer service this time they fall short.,4
4809,"It's a fitness tracker. That's it..if you are looking for a smart watch this isn't it. If you want something to hold you accountable for sitting in front of the TV to long to give you something to strive for every week. To see how you are sleeping and if you are coming off as rude, then this is for you. Body tracking is nice to give me a visual of how my weight loss is going ( or not) and I have no complaints about it. It would be nice if it could sync with an app like lose it or other food tracking apps other then WW that you need another paid subscription for. I have 3 bands 2 cloth and one rubber. Cloth is more comfortable  but the rubber ones seem to track better.",4
4810,I am in love with this band its a great way to keep track of my health and is pretty accurate. The only thing I wish it had was the time I work as an EMT and need a way to keep track of time and if im using this to substitute for my smart watch then I would like to at least have a time on it. other than that its a good product I would refer anyone looking to better their health to this band.,4
4811,"I wanted to like this. The body fat feature is good. I like how it takes into account the intensity of your exercise. The app is ok. I thought the device was a little too thick. All in all, I think there are better options out there for less money. The monthly fee is what makes this a lesser value.I also understand this is a version 1 product. I’ll keep an eye on this and maybe give it another try in a couple years.",3
4812,It was exactly what I was looking for in a fitness band,5
4813,Would give 5 stars if it was a watch. I knew it wasn't going into it but now wish it had the ability to show the time and date.,4
4814,The battery life on this product is horrible. You have to charge it more often than you wear it. It's a great concept but amazon needs to step up their game. There are plenty of other smart watches who do a much better job and are of better quality for a lower price.,2
4815,Love sleep function. Very light wt and comfortable to wear.,5
4816,"The band itself is cheap and gets caught on other things. The battery life is 'no bueno'. The app seems fine but the voice tracker is useless to me. The fat 3d version of myself was disturbing and promoted me to stop eating ice cream for two days until the battery died, then I shelved it and went back to my Garmin. Not impressed.",2
4817,Don't waste your money.  The data collection is very inaccurate.,1
4818,"The sleep tracking is hit or miss, mostly doesn't register any sleep.  The tone recognition is a cool feature that works pretty well.",4
4819,I have used alot of diff smart an hybrid. This unit is like not there. Just forget wearing it. Sleep works amazingly better than most an software is awesome. They really put alot of thought into both.Negative  not worth the money with the battery life. Maybe 24 to 30 hrs. Terrible. Never had something so good be turned to crap over a light weight junk battery.,5

4823,"I want so badly to love this fit tracker. But this thing does not accurately pick up my workouts. I have put it in the correct position, one finger above the wrist bone, and I STILL have to manually add in camp gladiator workouts. I can see the stats of my heart rate and what not after manually adding, but not until then. It will pick up me walking at a face pace at work, but doesn't register when I have done a 60 min high intensity workout. This really baffles me and make me question whether the points it gives me is even correct. I did not enable the tone feature because it seems really invasive. I wish there was a way you could tell the tale that you are starting an activity and specifically want to track it. This picture shows the stats halo came up with after I manually added in my workout.",3
4824,"My experience is not much different from what others have written. I was excited to be selected for earl;y shipment. Initial reaction: Cool to get my sleep analyzed. Creepy to foto my semi naked body. Interesting to monitor my steps. In retrospect after a few months :1 I don't quite get how to manage sleep. Clearly I get a better score if I don't wake to pee, but how many 67 year old guys can do that? If you fall asleep in a nap during the day, it combines the nap with the prior night and downgrades your night's sleep as if it was a 15 hour sleep with a 6 hour interruption in the middle. That's bad AI. I wake up refreshed and get a bad sleep score/wake up groggy and feeling lousy and it tells me I had a great sleep. WHAT SHOULD I BELIEVE? HALO OR MY BRAIN. Everyone complains about the fat shaming measurement of body fat: grossly overstates body fat and pisses people off. Wife returned hers on that alone- insulted! The labs are nothing special. The activity monitor misfires on occasion and doesn't read activity levels properly. On balance an OK product you keep wearing but I will not renew the service when the free initial service runs out.",3
4825,"One more device to track and influence our life from Amazon:After voice, locations, search history,,,,, now start tracking our sleep as well.Buying this device is like paying Amazon to track our data while we sleep, walk, run, and then use this data to sell shoes, vitamins, protein, cloths, beds, mattresses, etc.Humans are already sleeping, running, walking for 1000's generations with out these sleep band from Amazons and Apples. Another not so smart product, hence do not buy.",1
4826,"I thought it was a watch, so I returned it.  It is what it was designed to be, but I wanted it to replace my watch.",5
4827,"It was difficult to pair, very difficult to sync no longer working after two weeks. Will be returning. Also could not get use to not face.",1
4828,So I only have it for one day and while body scans impress by their visualization I am very suspicious about their accuracy. They show that I am fatter than my Withings Body+ show by 6% and also that I excersise by roughly 16% more than what my Apple Watch show. I can expect calories count to be different because Halo continuously measures my heart rate but # of steps should match. 16% difference is a lot Will be very interesting to see how they compare to Dexa if anyone can post results.Tone is useful for those who speak languages other than English at home. I’d expect their app to recognize English phrases and only analyze tone on those rather than just listen to everything. Disabled it for now,4
4829,"It doesn't always track my tone of voice. Haven't done the body comp yet. Sleep tracking seems good, realized I dont much deep sleep and I'm more of a light sleeper. Tracks heart rate and steps throughout the day. Has other features on the app ill probably start using now that I have more free time. I wear my sensor under my wrist instead of on top bc it was hurting my wrist when flexing my hand during my job even when I loosened it. The sensor is too big and not ergonomic. I suggest some sort of padding for future models. It still reads fine under my wrist. It randomly blinks and idk why. No instructions on how to clean the fabric band which got dirty fast from work. It says it can very worn showering but I use that time to charge it. Also needs instructions on how to change the bands if needed. Over all its a cool thing to use but I can't see needing the features of it over a long period of time. Will update later.",4
4830,Kinda bulky. The voice recognition doesn’t always work,3
4831,"I wore it unless I was charging it. One day I took it off and noticed the back piece cover? stayed on my wrist. So it's broken.  I did like tone feature, and I was doing the body composition. I used other features too.  I have a strange sleep schedule, and it doesn't seem to track sleep unless it is at night.",3
4832,"Initially I had trouble connecting my halo band and Amazon gladly shipped me a new one. In the meantime I got it connected and they were able to cancel the new shipment and allow me to keep my original halo band without further charges. I love it! It works great recording my sleep patterns, fitness and exercise. I connected it to my WW so through Apple health my steps are recorded on that app.. works great on the body scans also and suggests exercise routines to strengthen the weak areas. I also like how it looks like a regular wrist bracelet and not a big clunky band. I highly recommend it!",5
4833,"Solid entry into the market. Basics- the activity and sleep tracking is reasonably accurate, at least compared to the Whoop or FitBit. App is solid, and they are clearly always working to make it better, which is a huge selling point for me.The band is okay, not amazing. It’s not the easiest to remove, but it is comfortable. Weird side note- the band kinda needs to be rinsed occasionally because it starts to get a weird smell after a while. This is an issue I did not have with a very similar fabric Whoop strap.The voice/tone stuff- cool idea, but besides the creepy factor: it’ll drain your battery in perhaps less than a day, so it’s usefulness is basically zero. I turned it off very early on.",5
4834,"Update:  I have to change my score.  The Halo stopped working after about 4 months. The tone part runs down the battery and is worthless since it doesn’t tell what you were saying.  The body imaging is good, but costs a monthly fee and it has nothing to do with the tracker.  They could just release an app for that without the over priced tracker. It’s just not worth the money.  There are many better options.There are lots of things to like about this activity tracker.  The body scan feature seems cutting edge and accurate. The activity tracking is different than you’re used to and better than you’re used to. The sleep tracking works very well and matched what I expected.  The videos you get are nice including Headspace meditations that I’ve been a fan of for years.  It is comfortable and easy to charge. So what is the bad...The heart rate monitor is nice, but you have to bring it up live to see it.  I don’t see any way to get periodic updates on your heart rate which is disappointing.  But my main issue is with the tone part that measures your voice and tells you your mood and how you present to others. The issue is not accuracy because it really seems extremely accurate.  The issue is that it doesn’t tell you what you were saying, only the emotion.  If I say you sounded angry or sad or happy at 2:37 yesterday do you really think you will remember what was happening at that time?  I know I haven’t been able to do it so it seems that it isn’t as usual as it could be.  Even giving me one sentence of what I said would likely trigger my memory.I understand that some people may not like that because of privacy, but it could be optional. I would also love an immediate notification telling you that you sound angry. That way you could catch yourself early.  There is a way to see results in real time, but who what’s the point unless you are on the phone? You can’t be staring at the app while holding a conversation.  I really wanted the tone part to help me be more calm, but as is it just seems like a wasted opportunity to be something new and highly useful.  Overall, I can still recommend the product with the hope that they provide updates to the tone feature.",2
4835,"1.  Doesn’t hold a charge for long2.  I find the charger flimsy and difficult to use3.  Loses connection and has to be rebooted4.  I use the tone and it says that I am doing a tone that I find that I was not using.  I am not sure how it distinguishes a tone.5.  I do like the pulse indicator; however, I have to go to the phone to get that data.6. This is a good idea, however, it needs work.",2
4836,"I'm disappointed. The biggest drawback for me is the inability to pair it with the top fitness apps. Only Weight Watchers and John Hancock Vitality?My Fitbit does way more than this device. If you only want to go track activities, BMI, sleep and voice analysis, then this is for you because that's all it offers. I like a screen so I don't have to keep opening the app to check stats.",1
4837,"Once the novelty of this wore off I am not even wearing it.  Its great to track your sleep, and see how your voice sounds, but when you have the voice analysis feature on your battery drains fast.  To monitor your body fat data you need to constantly take a picture of yourself and upload it and I haven't done so other than my first one because I just haven't found the time.I think this will be a great product once more features are added, but right now it doesn't do enough to wear it all the time or impress me.  I will so not be continuing to pay the monthly fee once my free 6 months are up, it isn't worth it at this point.  My Samsung Galaxy fitness watch does way more (beside the body fat analysis) and I am not paying a monthly service fee.  I am sure Amazon is going to make this great as it develops it and then it will be worth it, but right now the product isn't anything exceptional and not worth a monthly fee for the little info it gives.",2
4838,"Used the band for about 2 months.  There are a lot to like and it's been covered by most reviews.  This review will focus on what was supposed to be the niche Halo is targeting and how it changed my view on the product.--- The good ---This band generally does what other bands do.  track your steps, track your sleep, tell you what your heart rate is, etc.  the only twist is that there is no screen.  they say it's so it won't distract you...--- The negative ---1) Screen being distracting is a personal preference.  What's the point of tracking something if I don't get any feedback on what action I should take?  If i'm going to rely on my phone, isn't it forcing me to see something even more distracting?  you be the judge.2) For the first few weeks of owning the band, charging was easy but very frequent.  2 days of battery life with about a 4 hour cycle makes it almost a chore.  you can get 7 days if you turn the mic off, but then you are giving away a key feature that Amazon is advertising, what's the point?  that's like a car company designing an electric car and telling you it has a 1000 mile range if you drive it at 5 mph and under normal driving you get 30 mile range.Then after about a month, it became difficult to 'seat' the band to the cradle to get it to charge.  worse yet, about every 10-15% of charge I have to ""re-seat"" the band to get it to charge again.  I am not certain what the problem is because I have tried every recommended step from Amazon.  This means it takes 4-6 seating to charge the band to full...  which depending on when you notice the 're-seat' the charging time could be a full day.3) Body scan.  I am not a scholar or a doctor but seeing people posting their results and describing themselves, there appears to be some inconsistency.  this may be the most accurate approach but is quite different from all other regularly used methods so beware.  on my bathroom scale, which only really measures your lower body, I am around 12%.  my scans are anywhere between 18-20%.  I am 140 lb male 5'9.  and i'm being told i'm not even in the middle of 'healthy' I am really curious to what % of users are deemed healthy by the body scan's standard.4) Tone analysis.  I often find it difficult to connect the tone analysis to an actual point of conversation, it seems to take the tone analysis at too granular level.  so i'll have a 5 minute conversation with my wife and i feel very positive and upbeat, then look at the tone analysis and the tone is all over the map.  maybe the analytic is not at the right grain of analysis and that's not really helpful for me in terms of understanding or improving it.  if the analysis is taking it at the work / sentence level, then i'd like to know what made me sound angry in an overall very pleasant conversation so I can make those changes and use / craft my words better.",2
4839,I am a few days into wearing the Halo and I am not at all impressed.Con: The sleep tracker is WAY off. I wake up to use the bathroom twice a night. After the second time it stops tracking my sleep even though I sleep 4 hours more.Con: The Halo step tracker seems to only track when I swing my arms as I walk. Halo shows me walking 9000 steps a day at work. I push a cart all day around a warehouse. I walk for 7.5 hours. 3 other trackers I use ALL track me at 18000-1900 steps a day.Pro: Halo does read through my heavily tattooed skin. Fitbit and other trackers do not do that consistently.Pro: The heartbeat is accurate. I measured it against two medical devices and it is right on.All in all I’m underwhelmed. Will update of it gets better. If not I’ll just throw it in the junk electronics drawer or give to a child once the 6mos. are up.,2

4841,The sleep tracking has been an eye-opener.  I thought I was getting much more sleep than I am.,5
4842,"Helps keep me conscious of my steps and activity during the day. I love the recommended tips and exercises in the app. The app itself is easy to use and helpful. The band is comfortable and charges quickly. I think I end of sleeping on my arm with the band on during the night so it doesn’t always track my sleep as accurately. Other than that being the only downside, I am happy with my purchase and recommend the band to friends and family.",5
4843,This is by far the best device I have ever purchased.  Very simple to use and it provides alot of good data in a great format.  I would give 5 stars but the charger is very hard to get to work properly.  I have known 5 people that have requested a refund over this issue.  I hope they get it figured out because it is overall a great product and much better than the other fitness bands or watches I have tried.,4
4844,"For the price and what this provides, it is a bargain.  I have used it for several weeks and keep discovering more things it can do.  Along with obvious options, there are recipes, exercise programs, recommdations, and many more.  I especially like the Sleep feature which shows your sleep patterns, how long it takes you to get to sleep, light sleep, deep sleep, REM and how much you are awake at night.  You can track the activities you do and it shows the itensity and points earned.  Everything is trackable/saved so you never lose it.  Live heart rate, calories burned each day.  I could go on and on, it is truly an amazing little device.  Got one for my husband and he is happy with it also.  My exercise program has increased as it keeps me accountable.  Highly recommended.",5
4845,A great measurement tool that gives me everything to manage my health at a glance.,5
4846,"I really like this band and anything that helps improve my health awareness, is great.One thing that’s already driving me crazy though is I can’t save the recipes as a favorite, unless I’m missing something.",5
4847,It’s pretty useless. The app is bland. The band is bland. Also who wants to look at these scans of their bodies. My scale gave the same body fat reading. So get an Apple Watch it’s more motivation to work towards closing the rings and it has more functionality. Over all like the Ecco auto this product is a bust. Wore it for a month. It doesn’t look good and it doesn’t do anything. The labs were cool but I never kept up with them. They are pretty forgettable.,2
4848,I purchased my halo back in 2020 during beta I’ve enjoyed for the most part especially the features. However I’ve been getting these burns/rashes on my wrists when I wear it. This band has limited warranty but surely they can see this is an issue as I’ve seen other review say it has done the same to them.Update: Amazon replaced my old halo and seems like they’re looking into this issue. They didn’t have to. I would’ve bought a new one eventually but they were nice and kind enough to replace it. I’m giving a 5 stars due to the excellent customer service I received.,5
4849,"I never wore a fitness band much, tried this out, and I like it.  I love that the battery lasts all week, so I don't have to worry about charging it every day, cause I'd get no use out of it if I had to do that.  And you want to wear it while you sleep not be charging it at that time.  I love that it is waterproof, so I don't have to worry about taking it off to shower or workout.  It seems very accurate about steps taken.  I wish the app was better, especially around visualizations of graphs of previous days, it has the data, you can download it, but it doesn't do a great job of historical data display.  I'm a night owl, so I hate how after midnight it resets everything to show me on a brand new day when I haven't slept yet, and there is no option to view just the previous day, only previous week.  But I am hopeful they'll do software updates in the future.",5
4850,"I have had this a few weeks and love the accuracy of the steps, intensity of workouts, calories consumed, and sleep tracking. I’m very glad I have made this purchase as it provides more than expected and is much more accurate than expected.However the battery sucks. I can wear it for about 4-5 days (turned off the tone analysis, that’s just creepy) but it takes HOURS to charge, not 90 mins like advertised.Other than the battery I love it and am happily surprised at how much more in tune I am with my body now better understand my sleep and exercise patterns.",4
4851,"First of all, it rubs on my wrist and now I have an open sore!Secondly, what does the information mean?  Sleep tracking seems good, but activity seems weird.And who has time for all the labs.Probably returning mine next week.",1
4852,"So far I’m really happy with this! I’ve noticed some discrepancies in the sleep tracking, but for the most part it’s pretty accurate. The body scans are super helpful to me, it’s nice being able to track that regularly and accurately!",5
4853,One of the best items I’ve ever used it’s great to keep track of my sleep my way my blood pressure my heart rate gives me ideas and how to exercise better in a better,5
4854,"The halo wearable band is such a great gift and band. The device tracks heart rate, steps taken, BMI, and sleep quality. There is a mobile app that is so accurate on sleep tracking, and what you can do to improve your health.  I bought the grey one the model is sleek, very modern, and fun. This watch is a holy grail for in technology which was priced awesome any other brand would run you hundreds of dollars. Looking to get your overall health on track I recommend you start with the halo.",5
4855,Work great,5
4856,"It's extremely comfortable. Just takes a bit to find the perfect spot on your wrist that allows full mobility. Afterwards, it fits like a glove.The app is a little odd to me. Perhaps it's because I'm used to a different GUI for fitness apps, but it wasn't completely intuitive to me at first. But also wasn't the least sensible app I've seen. Just took a bit of exploring. Not too hard to navigate after understanding how everything is organized.Heart rate compared to Samsung galaxy s3 is pretty on point. If anything, I figure it's probably more accurate because the s3 is looser on my wrist since the strap has holes like a belt instead of being fully adjustable as with the halo's velcro strap. Halo is also lighter so less prone to spinning around my wrist.Sleep monitoring seems ok so far but haven't stress tested it yet.Tone is really cool. I tested it on an old recorded DnD session. It wasn't perfect. Perhaps because it's my voice in a recording instead of my voice in real life. And it didn't capture every single sentence completely accurately but the way I speak can be a bit odd and monotone. Given that though, it's still 90+ percent accurate and was fun to watch live.Body scan is the main reason I got this. Supposedly it is the most accurate body fat percentage tracker and the only health tracker short of home scales and professional body scans like dexa that can even calculate my bf%. And so far, I believe it. I thought it was really cool. Way more economical than paying to have it professionally done if it is true that it is approximately as accurate anyway.One review mentioned the charger was hard to use. Admittedly, it doesn't really make sense for a wrist device to not be magnetically connected to the charger or have wireless charging capabilities. So if anything, I'd deduct one star or half a star for that. But it's not significant enough to deter me from using this device.Can't speak on longevity yet. Just got it yesterday.Privacy concerns? A stranger on the beach can snap a picture of you in minimal clothing. A fling can record even more incriminating things of you. Someone within earshot can record you manually, as can your own phone. Many people already voluntarily send intimate pictures to others they think they can trust only to learn the hard way why they shouldn't. Someone who simply doesn't like you can acquire just about anything of you. Phones and computers can both be hacked. Other fitness trackers have location tracking already along with phones and modern PCs. From birth, almost everyone's existence is recorded. There's little to no reasonable way to live more than an extremely modest and solitary life in a developed country while also trying to prevent personal information from being shared. No reason to be upset with Amazon anymore than anyone else who owns your information. There is comfort in a time when people could be in public and be sure that their reputation would only be spread by word of mouth, if at all, but that time is long gone. And it's not always meant to be a bad thing. Privacy is nice as a luxury, but that also leaves a lot of unfortunate events that can happen with no way to prove it to others for self preservation purposes. It's ok to accept the world as it is. Just keep a low head and hide in plain sight if need be. Better to be buried among many in a server than for one single stranger who lives near you to take a worrying interest in you.No screen? Come on, it is advertised as a screenless product. Not everyone's preference, but that doesn't make it an objectively bad product. There are so many wrist devices with screens already. Choose one of those if having no screen turns you off, instead of buying this one then leaving a bad review for a feature that it is advertised to have. And the fact that it doesn't have a screen actually makes it more comfortable and allows more fashion options in my opinion. Like wearing an analog or digital watch that isn't a smart watch with it for those who have an alternative watch they prefer.May edit as I discover more about this device.",5
4857,The the new Amazon Halo!! The things that it can do is amazing and all the information that it tells you is more than any other tracker. The only down fall is it has issues charging all the way.,4
4858,"Had to return, didn't fit me. Lol. Very short band.",3
4859,I usually don't give reviews but I'm so happy with this band app vanities ect it's amazing!!!! The app is great there is so many things to get you going in the right direction. The band is so comfortable I have no problem wearing it while I sleep... I was looking for something mainly for sleep and attitude and I'm so happy I found this cuz its deff worth every penny so far well see if it holds up to its reputation,5
4860,I got this really to keep track of my sleep. But the voice thing is a very cool thing I have learned who trigger's my I am annoyed voice.And the battery last longer than I thought I have worn it for two days taking it off only to shower. And I will just now have to charge it. So nights sleep plus two days of work. And I like that it will disconnect that saves the battery. And it sincs right away when you are on the app. Definitely recommend.,5
4861,So far I'm not sold. Maybe I've had a fitbit for too long but this doesn't tell you miles on walk or hikes. I don't like the tone feature. I also don't like the app or find it to be very user friendly or intuitive.,2
4862,"Just what I needed.  A bracelet band that compliments my smart watch.  Does everything I need.  Tracks all my workouts.  The tone feature already has me curbing my attitude in the past week.  So far, I definitely recommend it.  Grab some rubber straps too.  Although the fabric strap does dry quickly after a shower.  Grab one and try it",5
4863,It a bracelet tracker,5
4864,"Don't even notice I am wearing it!  It was very easy to sync, and I love seeing the real time results!",5
4865,"All of the features work very well. I really like being able to see how I was speaking with others. The fact that its not a watch allows me to have more of a variety of watches to wear without looking weird.Only issues I have found is that your do have to fiddle with it a bit to make sure its seated correctly in the charger. And for heavy set people like myself it tends to want to move over your wrist unless you tighten it quite a bit. Other than that, charging it while taking a shower is all it takes to fully charge and keep it going each day.",5
4866,"I've had a number of issues for years...neuropathy, tired, sore and becoming quite cranky due to it all. So it's now possible we are looking at Parkinsons disease. This device is helping myself and the Dr while we go thru medications and procedures.I began with a video baby monitor to view my sleep. Lots of arm and leg movements. I wanted this item to help answer more questions about my sleep. This product does that superbly. I can March up the video from the monitor with the charts from the halo!!!I'm not using the body portion of the device because well...I'm good with how I look.Knowing how much I'm moving daily is important since without sleep, who wants to move?The voice tone portion is also important. You are able to manually turn this feature on. Say you have a talk with someone and want to see what your tone sounds like to others, you can turn on the feature and check it when your done. It's interesting.No issues with rashes or sores and I'm a redhead.I really like my halo!",5
4867,"I wish the battery lasted longer. It has the potential to be great. I love the app and the sleep tracking. I stopped using mood on tracker because it just DRAINS MY BATTERY. Other, than that. Best bang for buck tracker out there.",4
4868,Excellent! Highly recommend,5
4869,"Nothing has given me more accurate feedback on my sleep than this thing. And the steps are pretty close, the intensity feature needs work. I work manually outside and really push it some days. I get great feedback one day and the next it says I was moderately working during a long period that was far from moderate so hopefully they will address that glitch. I wear a second fitness device about 1/3 the price and it does really well serving its purpose.. You can set 5 alarms and it vibrates the underside of your wrist at the vein, you will not miss this notice like a sound that just gets ignored and I got tired of reaching into my pocket to pull out the phone for a time check, I just tap it. The alarm features are important because I take 2 minutes out and see how I am feeling and whether or not a dose of medication is needed or not. I wish the Halo would incorporate that feature. I look forward to upping my game and starting to pair it with my phone and start utilizing all the workouts offered. So far just a portion of what it can do has me very happy.",5
4870,"I love this mobile app. I hate the band and the quality of it.I waited to buy the blush pink, now realize it was not necessary as the band stays dirtyOnly black is functional or purchasing the alternative plastic bands. I haven’t use the voice recognition.Ultimately I love and enjoy this app and device!",4
4871,I really want to love this tracker.  I do love it.  Just waiting for some additional enhancements and more health tracking,5
4872,"WOW! I'm quite impressed (and I am a tough judger). It does everything as advertised, and some more. The tone is quite accurate, and very insightful. This is like the best overall well being tracker you can get. I had an apple watch, i had a garmin, but this offers something different (and not JUST different, but it does the different WELL...thats the most important is that it does it WELL!).I'm impressed Amazon, as I always am. Keep up the good work :)",5
4873,"Ugh.....I sooooo wanted to LOVE this. I got this early at a refucyprice and I was excited. I like to wear watches so having no screen on a fittness tracker is wonderful. Sleep tracking didn't work, steps didn't track (though it did track some on one day). I rebooted the thing so many times. Nothing worked on the tracker. The body scan is kinda cool but I can look in the mirror to see what wobbles! Lots of cool fitness classes on the app that I think will be great. Finally made the call to see what could be done about my Halo not tracking. Non left in stock so I can't get another till March time! I bought a fitbit that wears as a clip/on wrist and will continue to use beachbody. I am going to watch the Halo as it improves. I hope it can be produced a little less bulky. I think people with slim wrists may find it slightly big and annoying. The strap it comes with (I got the rose gold) gets dirty very quickly. I'm outside a lot with my yard and animals...but I would have bought a plastic strap if it had worked. Overall my experience with Halo lost stars as it did not track anything so therefore did not work. App was great and this tracker has a lot of potential.  I would have kept it if it had worked and probably would have given it 5 stars.",2
4874,"Difficult to use. Didn't really track sleep well, just stick with a fitness tracker",1
4875,"I have worn FitBit watches for years and like the product, but I was intrigued to see what Amazon had done with theirs. I was excited to try out the ""Tone"" feature because as a business manager I would like to be able to monitor how I am perceived by others.I am sorry to say I am disappointed.I would like to be able to write a comprehensive review, but I didn't get that far.  The device paired fine with my Pixel 5, but wouldn't stay paired for more than a few hours.  Because there is no display, I couldn't tell if the problem was the amount of charge in the battery, so the band spent most of its life with me in the silly charging clip.  Sadly, after overnight charging, it still was not paired with my phone, so I did a factory reset and started over, going back through the entire setup process a second time.Day 2, SAME PROBLEM.  Again the band worked for a short time, then stopped syncing with my phone.  Back in the charger for the night, but in the morning, it still won't sync.This time, after the second factory reset, it was back in the box for return to Mr. Bezos.",2
4876,I'm so happy with this device. I'm still experimenting with all of its features. I will evaluate again later,5
4877,I have been using the Halo for almost 2 weeks and really enjoy it so far. The app is really user friendly and has a ton of options and features. I'm not sure how accurate the sleep tracker is because I also where a Galaxy watch with sleep tracking and between them the results are not close to the same. I will continue to wear this and update my review at a later time.,4
4878,"After 40 minutes on the treadmill, cooking breakfast, taking care of other things around the house and generally being ""up-and-at-em"" all morning, Halo logged ONE activity point and only 789 steps, and shows me as sedentary all morning. This appears to be a defect in my device after three days of use. Hopefully the replacement will work because I really want to love my Halo! It has everything I want in a fitness tracker, so please Amazon make it right!",2
4879,"I have had the Halo a few weeks.  I have been wearing it alongside my Fitbit band.  I am going to hold off on a detailed review for a few more weeks.But one quick note, the battery seems to need to be recharged every two days.  Compared to the Fitbit Charge which lasts much longer.",3
4880,So far I absolutely love the product. It does really well of tracking steps and any extra activities like walking. Keeps a great record of my sleep. Also it charges super fast which is very convenient.,5
4881,I could not connect it to my noom account but that is the only thing I dislike.,5
4882,"So originally I was pretty unimpressed with this device. The tone detection seems like a party trick at best, only providing entertainment and no real value. The app itself is okay but would greatly benefit from having widget creation abilities. The sleep tracker isn't the best (no where near as good as FitBit's) not tracking shorter sleep sections or resuming tracking if the sleep was interrupted. The step tracking seems to be pretty accurate but doesn't actually measure distance in any unit other than steps. The heart rate monitor seems to be fairly accurate. I like the idea of not using a smartwatch as it is pretty distracting and the fact that this doesn't have a screen decreases distractability as well as increases battery life. It's fairly sleek as well which I like. Requiring a subscription for basic features seems ridiculous (I don't recall the monthly price).But what I do really like and what changed my original opinion about this device is that it connects in real time to your alexa. Without even having to open the app you can ask you alexa ""How many steps did I take today?"" or ""How much sleep did I get last night?"" which is really cool not needing to even look at your phone to do it.",5
4883,,5
4884,Bought this fitness tracker for all of the app extras that Fitbit doesn’t have and totally love it.,5
4885,"So I love and hate this device. What I love- the sleep tracker helps me so much! I love being able to see my sleep patterns and correlate how I feel with how I slept. For this purpose it’s great and by far the best part. The voice analysis is pretty cool too and can be a useful way to see how others hear you...great for seeing how you come off to others at work, with your kids or spouse. I also love the step counter because I was previously using my phone and I don’t carry it all the time so it gives me a more accurate step count.What I hate- the band is uncomfortable. You have to wear it pretty tight in order for it to work properly and it leaves marks on my skin. The indents are actually painful. The body scan is not good quality and I did not like that feature. I also do not like how it takes points away for sitting. I am sometimes at my desk for long periods and there is nothing I can do about that! I lose activity points for sitting at work and that’s not fair. Not a good program for people who must sit and work.In summary as a sleep tracker I love it and my skin isn’t too bothered from wearing it for the night so I will keep using for that purpose. As for the other benefits I will definitely not renew when the trial period ends because I found them pretty much useless. Sleep analysis is the saving grace of this product.",3
4886,Love my Halo! Totally worth the investment.,5
4887,"Bought my Halo back in November of 2020.  The functionality of the app is great, a lot of information and pretty accurate activity measurements.  My biggest complaint a 1yr later is that the band doesn’t charge properly anymore.  I place it in it’s charging base, the red charging light comes on and stays on for a few hrs.  Then you look up and the light is off, “That must mean it’s ready to go, right”….WRONG!!  It stopped charging for some reason.  Now I find myself having to check the band periodically to make sure it’s charging still.  Turns a 2-6 hr charge into a day and a half.  I’ve reached out to Halo support, but no answer yet.  Definitely disappointed!!",2
4888,"I knew it was going to be a decent product when I saw the fat people complaining it wasn't babying them with their health. If I am purchasing a product with my hard earned money, I'd want it to be dead serious with me and not beat around the bush how I might be an un-active slob.I'm a machinist by trade so for the most part I'm at a CNC machine. I walk from the Bathroom to my machine. To go get tooling. To go complain to my lead about a part. To go to the break room for coffee. Not running because they don't pay me to run but just walk. I get around 200 points a week. To those people complaining its difficult to reach this goal. Yes. It is straight telling you that you are way too sedentary with your lifestyle. I WANT THAT. I want the brutal honesty. I want it to tell me when I go home for the weekend ""Hey bud, we're taking points away because all you do on the weekends is sleep and play computer games"".I do feel the step counter is either correct and my Samsung phone step counter is off. Or this step counter is super sensitive. Some days at work I'll check my steps and my Samsung app on my phone reads 5000 steps and my Halo app reads 13,000 steps. I don't really walk without my phone on me to listen to music at work so something is off somewhere.I don't turn on Tone because I don't need it reminding me I'm a sperg.I like the features telling you ""Hey you're body is appox X% body fat. Here's what you could generally look like if you got that down or what happens if it goes up"". This is good information to know. I want to slide it to a higher percentage and say ""I don't want to be that big, this motivates me to do more.""all in all. The device tells you how active you are. It's going to recommend a certain level of activity and it will inform you how you're doing. It's really not hard to walk around more. Don't listen to the people saying its de-motivating. Those people can come up with all the sob stories. Doesn't change the fact that they have the activity of a butter golem and will stay a butter golem if they don't change.",4
4889,I got this a few days ago but planning to return once I figure out how. Battery doesn't last long. Tone feature seemed neat but quit working after 1 day. Hasn't tracked my sleep in 2 nights because battery dies during night. Battery only lasts 24 hours. I do love some parts of it.and originally was very excited but I liked my Fitbit better that I wore for years. I threw the box away by accident so I have to find out how to return. Might try a later version after they get it working better.,1
4890,"I am an engineer that loves data and can't sleep.  This product should be perfect for me.  For the most part it is, but it will be tough to get me to keep paying for the subscription once my trial has ended.  Some of the features are ahead of their time and will be useful once more people become comfortable with it, but things like tonal analysis are just a bit creepy to people when I tell them what it does.Pros: weight, battery life, dataCons: comfort (either too tight or too loose), band comfort (stock band is not very comfortable and takes a long time to dry), connectivity (app requires good interned connection to even sync and display data properly)Overall, I think this is a good start.  My recommendation is to make a better silicon band stock for the product, and make it a bit more expensive without the threat of monthly subscription later down the line.",3
4891,It reviewed a shock from my car computer and stopped working,5
4892,my band disconnected and would not charge and the answer was a refund,1
4893,Love this device.  Very easy to setup and use.  Been fairly accurate so far.  Love the voice/tone feature.  Monitors how u speak to people.  Also like the sleep function.  I am realizing my sleep patterns are not the greatest.  Something I can work on.,5
4894,"I really wanted to like this band. I even got the silicone strap for it. But one day after using it moderately, the screen that covers the sensor ACTUALLY DISINTEGRATED. (see picture)They won't even let me return in. what an absolute waste of money.",1
4895,Exercise and heart rate were primary reasons to get this item. Sleep tracking hasn't always worked. Band may be slipping during the night though.,4
4896,"Let's talk about battery life on this gadget.. horrible!! I had to charge every day losing valuable steps and points.  Took about 2 hours to charge.  Step counting and activity measurements are way off.. sleep tracking was better than any fit bit i have had. Trust me.. you can do with out this.. to many glitches with this ""tracker""",1
4897,"Great sleep tracking, mobile app and the accuracy of it all is the best I've seen!! Not to forget the Tone feature as well as helped me talk better to people knowing how I'm sounding by the analysis of my voice!! I definitely recommend this product!!!",5
4898,"I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and I must say it has surpassed my expectations.  I work night shift, 7 p to 7a 3 nights a week so my sleep scheduled is weird.  It tracks when I sleep at night and when I have to sleep during the day.  The first week the numbers for activity was a bit off but it was learning my regular heart rate.  The longer I have worn it the more in tuned it has become.  I only take it off to shower and charge it during that time.  The battery has never gone below 50%.  I have used all part of it except tone and I love it.  Bought it on sale and so happy with my purchase!",5
4899,Liked but didn’t need returned as I use Apple Watch daily,5
4900,"Could you at least give me the time? This band gets dirty very easily, and it doesn’t even give you the time. I would not buy this again. Wish I could return it.",1
4901,I love this. It has so much useful data. It really was useful when I had a heart issue and could tell the doctor what my typical resting heart rate is! Love the fitness tracker and sleep tracker! Who knew I wasn't sleeping as well as I could!,5
4902,I like the sleep tracker because it helps me to understand if I am getting restorative sleep or not.  The step tracker and the heart monitor are also nice to have instant access to.  Wish it would vibrate when you have been too sedentary.,4
4903,"I love it for keeping track of my sleep, also steps I take in a day.  So many features, most I won't use.",5
4904,love the sleep & mood tracking,5
4905,Does all good,5
4906,"I bought this one for 2 reasons 1) I need to get in shape and this device checked all I needed 2) my job requires water resistant devices and this is perfect. With the APP and all the features like steps,sleep info, exercise info,recipes, and  voice knowledge that helps you see in my case stress areas to help me achieve my goals.",5
4907,"Love this band it's amazing I got it the day before yesterday and used it all day and it's showing me my health stats and shows how my sleep habit it's like. Love it! I'm so happy I made this purchase, time to improve my health and tone up!",5
4908,This is great! Best activity tracker I've ever had...,5
4909,"Stopped working after 1 week had replacement sent didnt work either , ultimately decided to send back bc I couldn't keep running to the post office for returns etc.",1
4910,"I really like this band, i just don’t like how fast the battery dies",5
4911,Absolutely love my halo. Does everything i need it to for me. Helps me know I’m getting great night sleep and help ms me learn the tone i give to people.,5
4912,"I got this as a christmas present for my husband. Initially, he was super excited about this!  the idea of all these functions on this band is great: analyze sleep, mood change, weight, BMI etc. It was working fine the first 2 days, but stopped sync after that, not tracking sleep, not tracking steps. I thought the first one we ordered was a defect so I returned it and Amazon has great customer service and shipped a replacement for free. Got the second one, still the same, stopped working after 2 days, cannot sync etc. Needless to say, we are very disappointed about it. I dont even bother returning this and have them ship another one to me just with the same issues. Looks like amazon needs to develop a better app for this.",1
4913,I was so excited to receive this at 'exclusive access' price but honestly I am not that impressed with it. I have not enabled the body BMI features and fully take advantage of the device because it is not comfortable on my wrist. It's way to bulky and just hurts have a while. Will not be renewing my subscription. :(,4
4914,"I tried the halo for a couple weeks and it just didn’t do anything more than my Apple Watch. It’s not something I prefer over my existing trackers. The body composition aspect is great but has nothing to do with the band it self, same with the classes and goals you get up. I love app itself and would love to be able to use that with my existing Apple Watch or Fitbit but the device itself is a hard pass. I’ll be returning my device the second I get a chance. It’s not accurate and sleep tracking was way off for me.",2
4915,I just started using this product but it seems like it's more accurate than devices I've used in the past. With the app I was able too scan my body and it shows you how you are and can predict where you'll be if you lose weight. I find that to be interesting and hope that getting better readings and insights into myself that I can actually lose weight. Will update as I use it longer.,5
4916,"This was the WORST set up experience I've ever had. I don't know which was more frustrating, charging it or connecting. The ""Tip"" was to turn it upside down and squeeze it until the light comes on. You obviously known that its awful.Then the battery, tried the tone thing which was ridiculous. It drained the battery so I turned that off. According to Amazon it last two days without the tone feature on. Barely almost got to 24 hours before the low battery alert. That's when I get to put it in that awful clip charger. Then, again turn it over and squeeze.  I don't have time to hold it until its done.I should have listened to the other reviews about it. Didn't because every other device from Amazon worked perfectly for me.",3
4917,"I received the Halo and have been using it for a month! I love my Halo!! Its sleep tracking feature is awesome! I do exercises the Sleep lab to relax before going to bed because my sleep quality is been awful for quite some time... with sleep tracking, I have been able to feel more refreshed in the mornings. I love its accuracy!! ( I wake up sometimes  16 times a night) I love the mobile app; it offers exercises to keep you motivated and reach your daily point goals. The weight track is a plus!! I don’t like my pictures; however, it reminds me why I need to work out!! My fat percentile :36.7% !  In my opinion, Halo is pretty accurate and a must have if you want to motivate yourself!! The only thing I don’t like its that I still hace to wear a watch!! But Im pretty happy so far!",5
4918,I would like to see some updates to the info provided in the app. More in-depth info. Body temp through the day instead of just during sleep for instance,5
4919,"CAN NOT GET IT TO WORK AT ALL. Total junk, waited months to come and had to buy a separate charger for it as it doesn’t come with 1. The charger came in about 2 weeks after ordering and the device came in at about 2 months and it doesn’t work so now I can’t send back the charger because the return time expired. Complete junk",1
4920,It's been okay. The band though it uncomfortable. It feels like it bruises my wrist and have to go at least a week without wearing it because it hurts my wrist so bad. Yes I have the correct size but the part the measures everything (computer part) is the part that bruises my wrist. I've tried loosening the band and switching wrist but it still hurts,2
4921,"Clearly a device with potential, but not yet at the level its high price puts it. (I got it cheaper during its introductory phase, and it is still too expensive for what it is and does).Pros:++ Bracelet - absolutely great. Other wearable I have owned or used had a plastic rubbery material bracelet that was good for sweat and quick clean, but horrible for itching, soreness, and general discomfort. This soft material is so much better - infinitely adjustable due to the design, super comfortable, elegant looking, and actually easy to clean in spite of its cloth like contents. I spilled some saffron on it, which is normally impossible to remove from such material, but after a couple of hand washes (thanks COVID), the yellow spot was gone.+ No screen - while it might be bad for some, for me it is great, as the screen would be too small to read anything without glasses anyway. Using the phone as a display works much better. And so I use the space where the screen would be to put a RoadID tag with my emergency numbers and contacts.+ Battery - I load it every days, but according to its percentage, it could easily go for two or three days+ Memory - probably to save the battery, the device does not try to constantly synchronize or connect with the phone, only when you open the app, and can keep data for a while, which means you do not need to keep your phone with you at all times, even when you are exercising.+ Activity target - a very simple way to establish and visualize if you are exercising enough.Cons:--- No vibration mode. Are you kidding me? Who forgot that? No screen makes sense, but a sport tracker should be able to vibrate to indicate targets, alerts, etc. So right now, this is a truly glorified pedometer with heart rate tracker. There are many cheaper devices that do the same.- App. Quite a few features, but missing some basic ones again. You see your instantaneous heart rate, but cannot start an exercise and monitor your indicators (steps, time, heart rate trend) that are part of what the device records! Some of the other features do not work (sleep too sensitive to movement), or are frankly baffling to me (tone - why would I want Amazon to track my voice?). I have not tried the body shape one.- Labs. Actually not bad, those are good videos. But the app is horrible, not telling beforehand enough about the contents, and while it says it is tracking it, does not really take it into account for the activity total of the day. But certainly not worth the monthly cost when it triggers.So all in all, make sure you know what you are buying before you do, because it does a few things well, but generally less than other devices. Hopefully they will build a version 2 with a vibration, and continue improving the app.",3
4922,Need to display at least show time,3
4923,"First off don't order the light colored ones unless you don't mind them staining after a week or two. Mine was pink and now it's filthy even though I've washed it really often. Secondly, still has glitches. My sleep is all over the place some nights because I read before bed. It's also a little discouraging that it registers most of my day as sedentary even though I'm doing the dishes, cleaning the house, cooking, painting, ect. But I'm sure it'll be nice when I'm back to my old pre covid routine. The body fat percentage is off and hard to get it perfect. But that's to be expected since shadows can make you look heavier I guess. As of right now I give it a 3 star. I'm sure it'll get better. Right?",3
4924,"The sleep tracking function is fine but it doesn’t seem to track my workouts when compared to my other devices.  Also, the light that emits from the bottom has left blisters on my skin a few times already, I’m not sure if it’s doing irreparable harm...",2
4925,"I receive in February a new one and 20 months later the bottom part broke like the other customers were saying. DisappointedI have my halo since September last year! And is very good I like to track my sleeping habits and it’s very accurate, you don’t need to be naked for the BMI pictures.The battery is pretty good , voice recognition is accurate I had an issue with my halo it was not connecting to my phone I call technical support they try to help my and at the end I got a new one , no problem whatsoever ❤️. I use an apple way and the heart beets are very close to each other even with the monitor in emergency room.Very happy but not with the payments after the 6 months free.",5
4926,I am enjoying my Halo so far. I wear it in addition to my Fitbit. It helps me work toward being more active throughout the day.,5
4927,"Nice product,  easy to use, but I returned mine because I wanted something with more features. For the price, it does a lot. Recommend for people that want low tech",4
4928,Not sure how well this tracks sleep.  I always take at least 30 min to fall asleep in bed watching TV yet the app always has me sleeping within 15 min of going to bed.  I wish they had put a display for the time.  I also wish the band was replaceable with some different materials. It is a little bulky compared to other trackers.  For fitness it is good. There are good workouts available on the app. Mostly happy with this.,4
4929,This app only world's for Activity and Sleep. Tone and Body i have tried several times and it never works. You set up Tone...which is to monitor how others hear you...so i accepted the terms and it goes through a sequence of having you speak certain things to get to know your voice personally. I have some those over and over....sometimes i complete 6 out of 6 items to speak out loud and it failsjust Ayer the 6th verse and other times it fails at 1 of 6. And as for the Body activity i have initiated it and it fails every time. I have followed the step by steep procedures and it fails. So i guess for sleep it is great seeing how much i actually sleep but it's not worth posing monthly for that when i can get a band elsewhere without spending money each month. This was not worth $69 not the $2.99/mthly.,2
4930,"I have been manually tracking my exercise progress for over 25 years.  I have been looking for a fitness tracking watch with some of the new features like active heart-rate, O2 levels and could count Steps and calories.  I was offered the Halo as a Pre-release product and since I own many Amazon products such as Kindles, echos,and  fire-TV modules I like much of their technology so I took them up on the offer.  I also bought a $45 fitness tracking watch at the same time and wore both for a my trial period.I have used it for a number of months now and determined it is a unique fitness tracker that provides a new way to track your fitness but I also determined it did not fit into my way of tracking fitness and it was not the right product for me.  I thought I would write a review because I did see where it might be the perfect device for some.PROs:- Sleep Tracker - tracks 3 stages of sleep and appears to be fairly accurate on the sleep it does track.- O2/Heartrate - It automatically tracks your high activity sessions.- It has a Fitness tracking Number concept that provides a new mechanism to monitor your progress day-to-day and can sync with an app like Weight-Watchers.- Body Analysis - Neat concept and may be a much better way to track body fitness than something like a scale, a tape measure and a calculated BMI.CONs:- No Display - all information must be sync'd onto you phone app and viewed there.- App - The app is functional and does provide real time information - on your phone.  This means you have to look at and manipulate your phone which I do no consider safe while running or walking.- Proprietary charger - you must use the Halo's proprietary charger which means yet another piece of hardware when traveling (The Battery only lasts about 3 days). I don't understand why engineering thought this would acceptable - just put in a USB C cable connector, or implement wireless charging. This one really irks me if it wasn't clear.- Proprietary Fitness tracking number - this number does not fit any current tracking system I use so comparison with previous tracking is not easily correlated- Data availability - most of the data about step count, calories burned, heart-rate is available only by manually requesting it from Amazon and waiting for the data to be sent to you in a zip file via email, usually overnight.  There is currently nothing that allows you to schedule the shipment of this data.  I guess I should commend them on the amount and detail of the data but it is too hard to get.  It can be imported into a spreadsheet BUT it takes some manual manipulation for it to be useful.- The body analysis is interesting but was not that helpful to me.  It is more disconcerting that pictures of my body are being transferred to their site for the analysis.  It does appear the face is blurred and you are assured it is encrypted and no one will see it but all I can say to that is ""Sure, I understand you have no intention of allowing anyone else to see it..."".- Data collection and other advertised ground-breaking features are probably all subscription based.  I say probably because it is not clear what data will be available after the 3-month free trial is up.- Sleep tracking - I was impressed with the sleep it did track but what I was really curious about was how much sleep I was getting in those periods at night when I fall asleep in my recliner while watching TV.  It never considered those periods in the sleep monitoring data and never added it to the total amount of sleep I was getting each night.  There were many times it said I only got 4 hours sleep when I knew I got at least 6 or 7 based on the time that I knew I was asleep in my chair.- It appears I may need to ""Call Customer Service"" to opt out of the auto-renewable Halo subscriptionI have returned the device because I found it simply does not fit my lifestyle.  That process is going relatively well so far - they will not pay for return shipping but they do offer free drop-off at one of their locker sites. I realize much of the disconnect is age related stuff that many will think If I would get rid of my flip-phone I might like the app (I do have a Samsung S8 if you are curious).  But it is more the fact that I have years of spreadsheets that I am comfortable maintaining for tracking my fitness data and all that data is mine -it is not stored in the cloud or in someone else's app.  Getting at the data to continue with my personal tracking was overly complicated.  I can get all that data from the $45 watch which has a display that shows me time and current Step count as well as my text messages, heart-rate and O2 level.For someone who has never tracked their fitness data, is looking for a way to automatically consolidate their activity and sleep data into a single concept, is into subscription services, needs to sync with something like Weight-watchers and are an avid phone app user who is comfortable with using an app during exercise, Halo may be the perfect device.",3
4931,"NEW 1-Star Review: everything I wrote in my original review below stands. As far as I can tell they have not improved any of it. I am updating this, reducing my rating, because I feel like whatever they are spending their engineering time on …the wrong priority items are their focus. For example, and probably the number one irritant of this product, you can’t use it if you have no cell signal. That is ridiculous. Why have they not fixed that? Guess where people want to see their real time data more than any other place? One such place is on hikes. Guess where you can’t get a signal frequently? Hikes. So, right when you want real time data on your steps or points you frequently can’t get it because your phone has no signal. That is stupid. That needs to be fixed. The band and your phone are in communication and that should be all that is required to see where you stand on steps and points. You should be able to look backwards at your previous data because that is not much data to store in your phone. If Amazon starts fixing some of these easy things to fix I will come back and increase the stars. If not, I guess I’m done with this thing because I can’t reduce the stars any further.ORIGINAL REVIEW @2 Stars: This had such great promise and it is with great displeasure I have to rate it like I am. Price is good. Battery lasts a long time. But...sleep, pulse, steps all are NOT accurate. Therefore the points are not accurate. And the body fat measurement...I just don't see how this can be accurate. Most adults are, uh, how to say...not ""regular"". So, uh, day to day your appearance / shape may look very different. That difference does show up as dramatic fat percentage differences using the photography fat percentage measurement. Overall a disappointment and, if I could, I would return it.",1
4932,"The battery life on this is nil. I have a Fitbit that I charge once a week. The halo seems to run out of charge in a couple days. I’m not really sure bc I don’t pay close enough attention to phone notifications and without a face on the device I honestly have to make a conscious effort to check battery life. all I know is that it’s really short. As for accuracy and other things, it differs from Fitbit slightly and I have no way of knowing who is most accurate, but Fitbit has a very good record in the fitness world for being highly accurate. I liked the body composition but didn’t really know what to do with it after I got the results and the voice tone, while interesting wasn’t useful bc I usually didn’t know who I was talking to when I looked back at my highest energy time and other stats. Plus, unless you don’t have any emotional intelligence I don’t think you need a robot to tell you your tone. LolAnyway, I appreciate the extra features but I think halo has a ways to go before competing with the top dogs. I’m returning mainly because of the battery life.",2
4933,"This review is actually of two Halos, the original nonfunctional one and an equally nonfunctioning replacement I will also be returning.Neither one of them has ever been able to record any data for what would have been a fairly sophisticated sleep function if it had worked. That sleep function was the main attraction for my selection in the first place.Amazon's technical staff was pleasant and earnest sounding on the occasions I spoke to them, but totally clueless as to any fix.Tickets were duly written up but that was the end of their communications to me.The voice tone analysis function did produce data, but is more of a curiosity than anything.  Knowing what percentage of my voice fits in the categories created results in my knowing nothing of any value as far as I can see, although it might have some value to aspiring actors.Not having a face is a considerable saving in both cost and bulk, but also means the Halo produces no accessible information during an activity unless teamed with a smartphone app, which has to be both open and viewable. A voice connection to a smartphone announcing pulse rate during an activity, for example,  would have been useful if it had existed.The single operating button is placed so close to the bottom of the side of the device's  case it is difficult to get a fingerhold on it, and is so hard to depress, that I suspect anyone with, for instance, arthritis in the fingers will find the Halo unusable. I frequently gave up and took the device off my wrist to get a grip on the stubborn little button., which produces no auditory or tactile signal that it has been successfully pressed.Battery life is completely inadequate. Even with the power consuming voice tone analysis function shut off, neither of the two Halos made it more than 24 hours without having to be recharged, much less than claimed.I was really prepared to like this device, and it was disappointing to find it so poorly designed in general and downright defective in the function I had found most attractive.There are many better designed competitors,  whose products actually work. I recommend that you evaluate some of them before wasting money on a Halo.",1
4934,meh not worth it,1
4935,"Constantly disconnects from your phone and then doesn't reconnect. You end up needing to hard reset the device and reset (add your data all over again) your account. Spoke with customer service three times about this and they finally sent me a different device. Guess what? I had the same problems. This device is flawed! Don't waste your money or time.With that being said, it did detect a correct heart rate and the speech recognition was incredible. The connectivity ruins the product though.There are $35 fitness watches on Amazon that are 10x better.",1
4936,"I was a Jawbone user so I love the screen less part, I just wished it would vibrate and have the alarm setting but it's not a big deal.Other than that, the app could be more robust but I'm sure will continue to improve.",5
4937,"good purchase, I recommend it a lot, I have had different types of band I have had two fit bit, fit blaze and fit bit insipre hr and they are good trackers but this in my opinion is much better the fit scratch very easy to the months after the constant use, what I liked most about this band is to identify the physical activity alone at the beginning and when you finish.",5
4938,Was super excited about getting this and it doesn’t work well at all. Everything is really off. Heart rate is way off. Doesn’t track sleep well. Device also will not work at all on tattooed wrists,1
4939,For a novice - crazy - no instructions of any kind. HELP,2
4940,I love the Halo!! My favorite thing about it is the tone of voice monitor. It's so much more accurate with body fat measurements than other apps and watches. I have tried diffrent physical tracker watches and this by far is the best.,5
4941,"This purchase was inspired by a daytime talk show host. I wanted to be able to track my tone when talking to others. I’m amazed in how it catches my tone throughout my day and how I could moderate my tone.  The additional features on the app are great. I sleep with my Halo and it tracks my sleep. I appreciate it that showing the levels of sleep I receive daily. The body scan tracks my body fat, and my activities are cumulatively added on this application. I’m pleased with my purchase and several of my friends are amazed at how easy and affordable it was to start. This charge quickly in under and hour for me.",5
4942,"I’ve only had my halo band for three days. I absolutely love it. I’ve had other fitness trackers and was not totally satisfied with them. What I love about the halo is the app and all the things the halo tracks. Including bodies fat!  It doesn’t have a watch face which is good. You can basicly forget it’s on your wrist for the most part. I use my phone to see the time for the most part or whatever clock may be on a wall, in my car or on a stove etc. It analyzes how intense your workouts are, your sleep stages. I could go on and on. Try it. You’ll love it.",5
4943,After trying many tracking devices I decided to keep this one!Thank you Amazon!,5
4944,This thing is amazing! I love data and charts things that prove what im doing has an actual impact! I've been less sedentary just cleaning and purging out things I never use I have lost 11lbs in 7 days from 240 to 229. And that's just my first week running around my apt. To the person complaining it didn't detect an unscheduled nap. That's not what it's for. It's only supposed to detect your restful NIGHTS sleep. Which it does flawlessly. People who think it doesn't meet the expectations of their false reality. That's all you. It detects my tone perfectly.  I suspect you have an inflated sense of self and it doesn't say you are perfect and that annoys you. I know im not perfect which means I have room to improve. Thus this is the perfect little device to help with that. I love it swim-proof and it syncs up once get back near my phone when im done!,5
4945,I believe this entire program is being dropped by amazon. Tried to collect on the protection plan and the phone # on the confirmation email doesn't work. The band itself is no longer in stock. I cannot get hold of Amazon to get support.,1
4946,"piece of crap, hasnt worked right since it got here, and keeps disconnecting and when it does it has lost all the data and makes me sign in and set up from scratch",1
4947,It does what it claims. I had no issues setting it up or charging. I charge it once a week. It is not in the way or bulky and the fit is good and easily adjusted. I do not use the voice part because I work from home and I don’t talk to anyone. I don’t need someone to tell me how I sound to myself. There is a few features that my Fitbit has that I hope they include in the future but I am happy with the simplicity of the design.,5
4948,"The sleep feature was inaccurate.  The first night I wore it, I slept well but the Halo showed that I'd slept poorly. Last night I was semi-awake to awake all night, and it said that I slept ""fair.""  It appears to have evaluated the sleep based upon the number of hours I was in bed.  Overall, it did not offer accurate information nor sufficiently helpful information that justified on ongoing membership or making my personal info available.  I was excited to buy it but ultimately disappointed, so I returned it.",2
4949,Been a great way to track my daily activity and sleep patterns.,5
4950,"Lots of positives but needs some work. First, I enjoy the small profile and uncomplicated design. The sleeping data is incredible useful and one of the main reasons I purchased it. But I would like more data on heart rate levels. Clearly it tracks it. I just wished I could see more detailed information about it like I can for sleep. For a data-centric device, this seems to be a glaring omission.And while I really like the idea of voice analysis, it lacks beneficial value without context. This feature is another great idea and one of the top reasons why I bought the Halo. But without knowing exactly WHAT was said, I can't get any real meaning. Was I angry because of an irresponsible action I had? Did I just drop a heavy package on my foot? Was I just quoting a movie? Without they information, it's hard to get a good idea of what behaviors I need to modify.",3
4951,"The original tech was exciting.  It fit only wrist (I'm a big man, and that's a problem), the canvas band was kind my hyper allergenic skin, and it didn't have any clock face for me to randomly damage (if you are clumsy like me you know what I mean).  However, the shine quickly fell.The battery kept going down fast with full contact with my phone, even without using the instant views like heart rate.  And the sound mode is supposed to eat the battery already so I never even try; I'd be charging it multiple times a day.The sleep function was probably the worst part; it would tell you the sleep function, but only after refreshing the sync multiple times with no pattern as to why.  And some times it refused to calculate the sleep at all.  And the times it did left me questions as to the accuracy of the findings.After I had collected a large amount of data, the band stopped syncing and I called the tech support.  The solution?  Reset the band so it starts over scratch....and I loose all my data.Honestly, the only reason I still wear it is the fact that I paid too much for it.  This is  Halo v1... I will say skip this one and wait for them to get it right.",2
4952,"Love the fabric band!  Don't need the face, just go to app for info.  Love the charging clip.  App is great as far as ease of use, sleep tracking and the body scan is really cool.  So far, I feel like this tracker and app is more motivating to me than some others I've tried.  However, I hate that I cannot add notes or journal anything.  Also, it doesn't have a calorie tracker or link to the one I like to use (as far as I can tell).",4
4953,I like the product. It really helps me monitor my sleeping routine and other staff to a healthy lifestyle. The one thing I would like is to have a time to look on it since it wears on hands..,4
4954,"Love it! I was looking for a bandThat would not replace my watch andThis is exactly it! Nice and easy app, love the voice/mood track... just love it!",5
4955,Could not get it to synch. Difficulty charging.,1
4956,"I've had it for over a month, I've got Tone disabled on the app and the Halo itself (hold button for about 3s/red flash) so the battery life is longer. I get about a week with it disabled. The sleep tracking is fantastic, the calorie/activity tracker is great (I love the competitive edge that negative points for sedentary time adds!). My only complaint is that there is no way to tell time on it. I understand fully that it's NOT a watch and it's Amazon's intent for it to be unobtrusive, but a minimalist addition of only the time would go a long way for me.",4
4957,I like it.,5
4958,"I bought this with high expectations... unfortunately I am returning it. The biggest thing for me was it was NOT capturing my sleep during the day.  I would get a few hours of sleep at night(4) before work, and would again sleep during the day. It almost never picked up my sleep during the day.  But my old Fitbit did pickup my sleep during the day as I had them both on during this trial run.  In all, I am disappointed that the HALO wasn't picking up my sleep patterns during the day, or even naps as the Fitbit did.  I ended up buying myself a new Fitbit Sense instead.  It's probably best to stick with the OG's of this technology. Amazon's Halo is still 2 years away from really perfecting it if they keep at it (Maybe Less). I will revisit when newer models come out. Hopefully, they will be MUCH BETTER.  As for the look, loved it even though it had no screen, looks like a clean nice, black band on your wrist that doesn't interfere with your daily duties.  Come on Amazon step up your game here now.",3
4959,"Love the sleep tracking part. It has really helped my daughter since she has a hard time falling asleep. The app is easy to use and has tons of help for falling asleep, staying active, and reminder to drink water. There’s only 2 things I wish it did; tell time and longer battery life. I charge it every morning as I’m getting ready otherwise it would die at some point the next afternoon.",4
